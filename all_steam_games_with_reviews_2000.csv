1716740,RPG,False,Starfield,"Sep 5, 2023","unplayable on my PC even with all the settings at the lowest. My PC can run Fallout 4 but not this. This is such a disaster. Wish I didn't spend more than 2 hours trying to get it to work, then I could have gotten a refund. [h1]Skyrim vibes with added space travel![/h1]
This game is [u]a lot[/u] better than I would have given it credit for, and I'm honestly enjoying myself quite a bit. Now, don't get me wrong here: I'll be the first to state that this definitely isn't a perfect game or such. Heck, I've already experienced a few glitches myself.

Thing is... games don't have to be perfect in order to be perceived as such.

[b]Maybe too high expectations?[/b]

Each to their own (!) but I think that one of the issues with people not enjoying this game is setting your expectations too high. See, this [i]isn't[/i] ""Skyrim in space""; space travel is simply an added game mechanic which exists within the way you normally play most Bethesda games.

So... no, you can't use your spaceship to sour over the surface of a planet in order to map out the location of most structures. Nor can you decide where you're going to land your ship. All of that is a bit static. However... the game does compensate for all that, because once you discovered a location on a planet you can tell the game to go there after which you won't have to go through the whole routine of landing and walking again.

And honestly?  I like it this way. Despite the fact that I already discovered quite a few locations I still more than often just refuse to fast travel and instead get into my spaceship, close the door(s), take a seat in the cockpit and then I take off. Only to do the test of the navigation once I'm in orbit. I even perform a (semi-) manual jump into the next system.

No, I'm [i]not[/i] ""wasting my time"", I'm roleplaying. Ever heard of it?

[h2]This game is [u]massive[/u][/h2]
There are a lot of NPC's for you to meet and missions for you to complete, and I really love it. Sometimes small, sometimes silly and sometimes you also need to make a bit of your own fun. And what I love the most here is that not everything gets presented to you or is made obvious.

For example...  early on in the game you'll discover the city of New Atlantis and [u]a lot[/u] of of the game will be done here or from here. Plenty of missions for you to pick up. And it seems like the perfect playing map... huge city, citizens everywhere and plenty of NPC's to talk with. Dare I say that the layout even gives me ""Kotor"" and ""Mass Effect"" vibes?

So [i[then[/i] I wondered... ey... the game also talks about vegetation, fauna and minerals (""resources"").  Is there more to all this than the game is showing me?  So I decided to hop over a fence, slide my way down and... oh dear: all of a sudden I'm in a whole new (dangerous!) part of the world. And I'm [b]loving[/b] every moment of it. I even met other NPC's which got me laughing quite a bit: ""[spoiler]I'm sorry, can't you see I'm busy dying?  ugh... [/spoiler]"", and sure enough; that's exactly what happened (not by my doing btw!).

Experiences like these make me convinced that sometimes... it's also what you make of things. And this game puts plenty of attention into detail.

[b]Destructive tools are also weapons![/b]

I've seen this so many times: you have this powerful tool which is strong enough to tear through rocks, but as soon as you point it to some hostile creature then... ""of course"" it doesn't work, why would it? This isn't a weapon you silly player!

Starfield does that ""a little"" different and I was quite surprised when I discovered it. To me it simply adds up to the complexity and vastness of this game.

No, like I said before it isn't perfect...  but I'm sure am having a lot of fun so far!

[b]Get the editor too![/b]

Starfield, just like Skyrim before it, is a game that runs on its own so called ""game engine"". Studios often rely on such 'engines' to help them separate between the process of game design and actual game development. For example.... say I want to add a new datapack (""note"")... thanks to the engine I don't have to worry about adding the right textures or having to make my own opening effects: all of that is something the engine can handle for me. [i]So..[/i] I just tell it that I want to add a new datapack (""Book"" / ""DataSlate"") and the engine will handle all the details like the way it looks, how it'll sound when I pick it up, whether I can actually pick it up or not, etc. All I have to do is select what I want to use, add the text I want to add and eventually I also need to place this new item somewhere in the world.

No coding, no making new graphics, just design.  And that's what [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2722710/Starfield_Creation_Kit/]the Starfield creation kit[/url] can help you with. If you're going to play Starfield then I highly suggest that you also pick up the editor. Heck... if you're stuck in a mission... you [i]could[/i] consider to check it out in the editor to see what you might be missing. 

[h1]In conclusion...[/h1]
Look, if you were expecting a whole new game with lots of different new mechanics and such.. maybe even secretly hoping for an actual spacesim (?) then sorry to say but you may end up disappointed. But if you can enjoy the idea of being able to travel through space and visit all sorts of strange planets and explore weird locations, meet new NPC's and such then you might be in for a treat.

The world is pretty big, and there's [u]a lot[/u] of stuff to discover & do, plenty to keep you busy for dozens of hours to come. The voice acting is very well done I think and although some characters look a bit weird... look, didn't we say the exact same thing for those in Tamriel?  Here I was thinking that elves would be the most beautiful beings in the world, not some bizarre looking hags.

Yes, there are loading screens and yes: your spaceship only gets used when you're actually out in space (so: in orbit), as soon as you're on a planet it basically becomes your (static) base of operations. Extra storage space to take with you wherever you go! ;)

But the vibes of old are all here...  exploring a planet, using your scanner and seeing ""unknown"" somewhere in the distance?  Let's go check it out!  Oh wait, there's another one!  Being able to find new loot, upgrade and customize your stuff, meet up with new friends (and enemies) ...

Each to their own, but I'm having a great time with this game, and can definitely recommend it because of that.

It's not as good as Saints Row The Third (my all-time favorite), but it's still a lot of fun. I can spend hours hitting cars to earn money while listening to an alien reciting poetry with an annoying journalist, or blowing eardrums with a Polka Gun, or even killing the police with a dildo sword or riding a velociraptor.

As I said, it's not as good as its predecessor, it's a little better than the spin-off in hell, but it has many flaws. The biggest problems are that the game's narrative is uninteresting, being inside a simulation breaks the immersion a lot, and having to constantly use a stupid portal ruins the rhythm. Also, being the same city for about 4 games is too much.

Saints Row 3 has an incredibly functional escalating story with multiple epic endings, but this one has a bad and funny ending, with no real consequences. Everyone is dead, the city is a lie, Earth has been destroyed, and you're in a stasis pod. It's simple, small, weak, and depressing.

In terms of gameplay, the powers you use all the time ruin much of the ""better than GTA"" fun I had with the third game. This, coupled with the glitch effects that constantly remind you that everything is fake, also contributes to the feeling.

Perhaps if there were a way to go back in time and reclaim the planet before the invasion, with more realistic means of travel and combat, it could be really fun.

Shadow Warrior 2013 is a perfectly average first-person-shooter. It does many things right, only a few things wrong and is in my opinion more enjoyable than the original these days. But in my case, it was pretty much the same things that already bothered me in the original, that hold the reboot back as well, just in a different way.

Just like in the original, my main pain points in the reboot are again the level- and enemy design and the gunplay. Where the original had frustratingly cryptic levels, the reboot has levels that are too linear, too drab, too visually uninteresting and generally too boring. Where the original had enemies that are simply annoying to fight, the reboot keeps it’s enemy variety to a minimum. The only thing that hasn‘t changed for better or worse at all is the feel of the gunplay. The arsenal still felt weird (for lack of a better term) and unsatisfying (except for the shotgun), making the combat pretty dull and repetitive in combination with the nonexistent enemy variety. 

All of this makes the game drag significantly with it’s 10 to 12 hours of playtime. Add on top an unnecessary and confusing story and you have basically a game that you buy, play once or maybe twice, then forget about. As mentioned Shadow Warrior 2013 is a solid game for what it is, but definitely not much more than a fairly tasty apetizer for the much better Shadow Warrior 2 and 3.

Add this to your library and make us whole. They don't make them like they used to It’s a claustrophobic, brutal journey into deep space that feels as heavy and cold as the ship it takes place on.
[h2]The Story:[/h2]You play as Isaac Clarke, an engineer,just a guy with a plasma cutter looking for his girlfriend, Nicole, on the USG Ishimura.The ship has gone silent, and the crew has been replaced by ""Necromorphs"".
[spoiler] The psychological gut-punch at the end is what makes this story legendary. Finding out that Nicole had been dead the entire time, and the ""Marker"" (the alien artifact) was using Isaac’s dementia to manipulate him into helping it, turns a simple rescue mission into a tragic descent into madness.  [/spoiler]
[h2]Gameplay:[/h2] The genius of Dead Space is that it forces you to unlearn everything. In most games, you aim for the head. Here, a headshot is a waste of ammo. You have to cut off the limbs. Using mining tools to surgically dismember monsters while they sprint at you is stressful and incredibly satisfying.
[h2]Graphics & Sound:[/h2] Even by today's standards, the Ishimura looks fantastic in its own rusted, disgusting way. The lighting is oppressive, using flickering bulbs and deep shadows to hide things you’d rather not see. But the sound design is the real MVP. The way the ship ""groans,"" the screams echoing through the vents, and the silence of the vacuum sections are masterfully executed.
[h2]The Bad Parts:[/h2] Padding and Turrets It's not all smooth sailing. The game suffers from excessive backtracking; you’ll find yourself running through the same corridors multiple times just to flip a switch. Also, the ADS (Anti-Asteroid) turret sequence is widely hated it's a clunky, frustrating mini-game that feels completely out of place in a survival horror masterpiece. Additionally, some of the ""boss"" encounters are more about scripted patterns than the creative combat the rest of the game encourages.
[h2]Outro[/h2] Dead Space isn't just a classic; it’s a masterclass in pacing and tension. It treats the player with respect by not over explaining the horror, letting the cold metal of the Ishimura tell the story. If you can handle the gore and the constant feeling of being hunted, it’s a journey you have to take at least once.

1116170,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",False,CyberCorp,"22 Apr, 2025","This is a pretty middle-ground review that leans towards ""recommended"". 

If you are like me and love the rare twin-stick-shooter aRPG then CyberCorp is worth looking into. This is quite similar to Housemarque's ""Alienation"" game. It leans more into looting and ""buildcraft"" than Alienation did, but doesn't feel quite as good to play.

I'm going to focus primarily on feedback and gameplay-feel. Game-feel is a bit all over the place. On the one hand, shooting with the various gun types does generally feel good. Unfortunately [b]hitting things does not.[/b] Enemies do not register hits particularly well, especially powerful ones. They don't flinch, knockback is almost nonexistent, and explosions don't knock them down. They ragdoll on death and that's it. 

This bad feedback issue is at it's worst when it comes to the games novel ""style meter"" mechanic. It's similar to Devil May Cry's mechanic of the same name, but tied to things like active reloads, slide dodges, multi-kills, and most importantly, finishers. The higher your style (from D-S) the more leeway you get with active reloads and the less damage you need to inflict on enemies before you can perform a finisher.

This mechanic works really well at increasing the pace of combat! -but the issue is that the finishers have all the impact of watching a 4 year old smash action figures against each other. The zoomed out presentation, the lengthy and sometimes very sloppy animations just make every finisher feel like an awkward mid-combat pause and not a triumphant mini-victory.

Frankly, I think finisher animations should just be removed (but the instant kill mechanic remain), or replaced with faster, flashier ones that need more particles or visual effects to sell their importance. I would even argue for something like a Shinobi style finisher where ALL enemies at the HP threshold are killed in one finisher. This would prevent the annoying (but safe) tactic of tapping ""A"" over and over on a group of weak enemies so you get to stay invincible during the lengthy animation.

The game also suffers from being a looter-shooter with extremely boring end-game content. The exotic weapons are typically more hindered than helped by their gimmicks, and there's little incentive to do anything but grind the same handful of missions over and over. Some of these missions randomize enemy spawns, but most do not, and the end result is an aRPG in desperate need of some kind of endless or lengthy randomly generated dungeon. very bland, repetetive, with boring story, and so buggy we couldnt play coop i have tried my hardest to like this game but playing this game solo even in the early goings is pretty shit.

2012510,"Action, Strategy, Free To Play",True,Stormgate,"5 Aug, 2025","robodog. I saw the ""mixed"" and had to voice my discontent. This was a huge bait and switch. Looked like the game needed funding in EA. Was fun, looked promising. Purchased the Ultimate Edition. On launch much just like every other backer I was disgusted. 

I'm not buying it twice... and its a spit in the face of everyone that had your back. 

Also the fact you use AI at all is another concern all together Played the game when it came out (first go around) and you could clearly tell it was made from blizz employees, remembering some of the maps i could practically feel thhe 'thrall' energy from warcraft 3 on the tutorial level, you could see some of the old re-hashed content, and you know what? that must be pretty tough adjusting mindset away from it to be fairly unique, standng on their own two feet. the gameplay wasnt to bad. ai wasnt to bad to verse, but personally i was interested more in the story. so the first round thhe game came out i would say ""reusing same materials"". however this second go around? the revamped campaign? levels have been redone, theres a few resuses in there, but it isnt 'shotty'. theres alot it has to offer in there. units look like they got some enhancements, cinimatic moments feel better, its a good start. heres the ""do i know if the game is quality?"" check or am i just some slump, who picked this up as my first rts. like i would hope alot of you have checked your p's and q's. i've played command and conquer (full series and let me tell you this aint no c&c 4) starcraft + broodwar, warcraft 1, 2, 3, tft. armies of exigo, empire earth, aoe, aom. 

this game aint bad, and i think its pretty good the devs seem open to feedback. i think the factions are done pretty well, maybe a little tweaking to the Celestial units wouldnt be a bad move (more so because they 'feel' small you know? like a 'tank' like unit feels like i got a tricycle with a horn on the front, but thats just redesign right? structure wise they feel kinda pyramid-ish? like they dont got 'make me feel like im a cybernetic angel lord' vibes, but thats just tweaking cosmetics, infernals i think handle well, a little spammy, but they seam like heavy hitters (best way for me to describe it, is imagine playing diablo, but your playing for team diablo. XD) Vanguard aint bad either i mean its your terran faction yea, but they got some unique tastes on them, melee is one of the odd parts, but welcome. the bunkers could use a redesign imo but other then that, again not so bad.

as for the 'skrimish' gameplay, one mode thats a 'wtf' is the stormgates coming up, and then rushing along to beat back the opposition so you can destroy the stormgate and get the bonus unit (its a cool gameplay feature but i think it might be better used as one of those boxes around the map you can randomly pick up. or like a warcraft 3 'item' you got from mobs, aint nothing wrong with that bit of nostalgia.) id recommend more maps, maybe play around with how units handle and stuff, but thats just my opinion. i mean lets be honest here as well, this is the closest thing to a 'starcraft 3' or warcraft 4 as you can get right now. i think it would be better to help them out, and support it, give some decent feedback. you dont think other marketing teams arent gunna look at this kinda stuff and go ""sheesh are we sure we wanna make another....?"" just some food for thought. never know whats going on under wraps, they could use your support if their struggling.

My advice is to get this instead of buying the more expensive remaster. you wont have any complaints running this on the highest settings and the only thing that the remaster provides is a multiplayer experience that isnt totally dead (yet) The story expands extremely well on the first game, really showing the aftermath of the Crysis 1's conclusion very well. The characters are extremely engaging, but the supporting cast didn't feel quite as engaging as your squadmates in the first one.

Also, I feel that the combat was not nearly as enjoyable in this one. Enemies feel like a bullet sink more often than actually being difficult, and headshots are beyond inconsistent. The suit feels downgraded from the original; I played full stealth in the first entry, and that felt almost impossible here.

I had attempted so many times to play this game but could never do it due to all of that. This time, for some reason, something clicked and I actually couldn't put it down.

I love how manual so many of the actions in the game are. That adds tension to the gameplay which otherwise wouldn't exist outside VR. Searching for objects is also pretty fun. I definitely didn't find all the resin the first go, but that's fine.

My one and only critique: throwing objects is a pain. Remember Wii Sports Bowling? How you have to pretend throw your controller and the ball ends up going backwards? I feel like I experienced that sorta thing here and there. Maybe I suck at throwing things in VR who knows lol

Combat enemies never get easier and it'll actually be harder to kill the level 100 raider wearing leather armor than it is to kill the level 100 3 star legendary mythical flying **cking bat. 
So glad that years in the making this game still is just as bad as the day it launched. If someone at bethesda could let me know why my brute of a character can take on bosses and body them but randomly they decide to roid out their most bare minimum bottom barrel opponent that takes more than half my ammo inventory to take out, 20+ **ckas* respawns that should not be necessary in the first place. 
Honest to god you'd be better off playing a rage simulator while watching your wife from the cuck chair for a more enjoyable experience. 
Can't forget that there's entire broken missions and story lines that can't be completed but the instructions clutter your screen and compass despite there being no resolution.  Sure you can go into the pipboy and turn off the notification but that doesn't excuse the fact that this game is 10 years old and they still can't manage to make a mission that is both cohesive and finished. 
That being said, if you are searching for a game that offers little to no satisfaction this is it. If you want a game where you fall through the floor on spawn and you can't use the weapon wheel without the game coming to 3 fps, again this is it. 
The only thing this game has going for it is its ""sims"" like camp building features and they can't even get that done correctly as you run out ""build allowance"" as soon as you add more than minimal detail.

636480,"Action, Indie, Early Access",False,Ravenfield,"May 18, 2017","I've owned and played Ravenfield fairly frequently since 2017. I enjoy the game and will pick it up for sessions from time to time even still, but I can't in good faith recommend this to people in it's current state especially having played it for so long. 

First, it's coming into it's almost ninth year of early access. I understand that it's being lead by a solo developer, but nine years of early access is a bit much. Granted I've seen the changes and they've been good but when you put it into perspective it doesn't really change much. Better models, slightly better (still shit) AI, some new maps and a clunky new gamemode. That basically sums up the big stuff. Ravenfield has the same short comings as Easy Red 2, where the AI sucks no matter what they do to it. Ravenfield needs a total AI overhaul. For example, literally since the game has come out, if you spawn on Dustbowl and attempt to get into a plane on the airfield, the AI will suicide run into your plane and instantly fall over/die. In a ground vehicle? They love to run in front of you. It's little stuff like that which is plain stupid.

But the big reason I find it hard to recommend this game is the horrific performance issues it's had since it released. I have played this game on varying pieces of hardware, from downright bad laptops to powerful computers. It has only performed well on higher end machines which would be fine if the game didn't look like playdough. 

But if you really want to buy and play the game despite it's flaws, do it. I still enjoy it and have played it on and off for nearing a decade now. It's a labor of love but that doesn't mean it's not deserving of criticism. Once it's fully released (which I think is coming in 2026), I will revisit this review. it is a good game i like th eshoting good game, modding scene could use some work but major potential.",0.7777777777777778,"Fight upon the Ravenfield together with your Blue allies!

People hacking into accounts and stealing all the materials you have access to and the admins/company doing literally nothing about it, even if you don't even want your stuff back, you just want the hackers banned. Also barely any active english speaking guilds relative to just about every other language, at least on american servers( this may have changed by now, but I doubt it).

I enjoyed it quite a lot, and will likely be playing again in the future to try out different choices and decisions. 

The character creator is really great, and I especially love the hair styles and physics. Combat was good and I liked the various powers and buffs you could play with. I enjoyed the story, although there were a few things that bugged me here and there about it, and the ""blight"" concept feels kind of unoriginal and overdone. The companion characters were interesting, and I'm a sucker for a party system in combat. I enjoyed the voice acting and was properly invested in their survival. 

Performance was fine for me. There were a few minor bugs that restarting fixed. Some occasional lag in combat that was annoying, since I rarely experience that with games on this laptop. But overall ran well. 

Looting/treasure hunting was unsatisfying. Some of the chests require elaborate puzzles to get to, with very little pay off. You're just finding copies of weapons and armor, which can't be sold, and at a certain point in your progression, everything you're finding is useless to you because it's below your current stats.

I assumed it would be another game I sat next to him for, smiling and pretending to care.

At first, that is exactly what happened. I watched him and his friends bounce balls off walls, fall through holes, yell at each other, and laugh at the dumbest mistakes. Balls would fly off the map. Someone would rage quit. Everyone else would laugh. I did not get it. It looked loud, messy, and pointless. I wondered how this could possibly be fun.

One evening, after he went to bed, I loaded it up myself. No story. No tutorials that really mattered. Just a ball, a course, and gravity doing whatever it wanted. I missed easy shots. Overshot everything. Fell off the map more times than I can count. And then something clicked. I stopped trying to be good. I started laughing at how bad I was. I relaxed.

The next day, I told my son I played. He did not tease me. He did not brag. He just smiled and said, “Play with me.” So we did. We argued over angles. We laughed at impossible bounces. Sometimes one of us would win, sometimes neither of us cared. The scores stopped mattering. The moments did not.

Age of Wonders III is basically the sweet spot between a fantasy Civilization and a tactical RPG – and it leans just enough into both to feel great.

On the strategic layer, you’re running a fantasy empire:

Founding and upgrading cities

Grabbing resources and magical sites

Expanding your domain with forts and outposts

Researching spells and empire upgrades

Nothing wildly experimental, but it’s all smooth and satisfying, with a great sense of building up power over time.

The real magic is in the tactical battles. When armies clash, the game drops you into a hex-based battlefield where positioning, flanking, abilities and terrain actually matter.

Units have clear roles: tanks, glass-cannon damage dealers, support, flyers, artillery.

Heroes feel like mini-RPG characters: they level up, get gear, learn abilities and can turn a fight on their own if used well.

Spells from the world map can be dropped into battles for big, dramatic swings.

It hits that perfect fantasy-strategy loop: scout → plan → set up a nasty ambush → win a fight that looked impossible because you used your tools well.

The races and classes are a big plus too. You don’t just pick “elves” or “dwarves” – you combine a race with a class (Sorcerer, Warlord, Dreadnought, etc.), which changes your units, spells and playstyle. A Dwarf Theocrat and an Elf Rogue feel properly different, even on the same map.

Downsides?

The AI can sometimes blob and carpet the map with armies rather than play “cleverly”.

Late game turns can get a bit long when everyone has huge stacks wandering around.

The UI is very 2010s-PC – functional, but not exactly elegant.

But overall, Age of Wonders III is a genuinely strong fantasy 4X with great tactical combat. If you like building an empire, nurturing a killer hero stack and then absolutely deleting enemy armies with well-timed spells and flanking maneuvers, it still holds up really well.",1.0,"Age of Wonders III is the long anticipated sequel to the award-winning strategy series.

I'm going to do this review a little bit differently than the rest because of the grade I'm giving it so let's get started. This game is going to start off with the good stuff, then the annoying stuff, then PSA's for new players because there's a lot the game doesn't tell you, and then finally some notes for the next game for the developers to make the game better in my opinion (I know the next game has already had a release date, but I hope these things are in MHS3 coming out in March).

Firstly, my rating for this game is a 4.7 out of 5 and was so so close to giving this game 5* it is by far the closest game in recent memory that I was going to rate as highly. I want to give a massive shout out to the audio and visual fx team, and the animators for this game. What a gorgeous game, from the battle animations, to the howl of the wind through the caves. When I had my headphones on this game made me feel like I was in the area that I was meant to be in, and narratively, they did an incredible job with the look of the game. There are also many many improvements over the first game such as the day/night cycles having different items, there's no more delay when exiting a fight to fight the next enemy, or the egg battles. I love the buddy system, having another person in the party makes it feel like a party, and the removal of the battle pouch was pretty nice. I love that as you go further into the game the environments get smaller, if you're like me and you like to explore everything before moving on, it's nice to do it all up front and then have the environments get smaller as you go along. And finally the addition of the new monsties, making all the eggs a different monstie, the boss battles, all of it was amazing. Overall such an incredible game, and so close to getting 5* from me. 

I want to briefly discuss the reason I can't go completely 5* on this and it has the same problem as the first game which is that the story makes no sense, and being that I'm a big narrative guy, it still feels like the story has more questions than answers, why did Red come to these places? Why are we doing random fetch quests like getting a little girl's necklace to go to the next area, why is Ena even travelling with us if she's not part of the party? As cool as it is to see the people from the first game, why are they randomly showing up in these places and have no reason to be there, etc. It's just the lack of cohesive storytelling that makes me can't give this a full 5* and the other thing is that the main character doesn't speak, but the good reasons I listed above do far outshadow this small issue.

Now some PSA's for new players on things to know the game doesn't tell you. 
First, I recommend playing MHS1. The game is significantly harder than this one, but only took me half the time and taught me all about the items so I wasn't a novice when I played this game. 
Higher rarity eggs are typically better than the eggs being rainbow or shiny. 
Adding Genes to a monster should benefit the attacks that the monster has, so if it has a poison attack, find a monstie to transfer that has the right gene for the build you're trying to go for. In addition, there is a secret system called gene upgrading in the rite of channeling. If you have two identical genes on two different monsties, you can overlap the same gene on the new monstie and make it even more powerful and gain stars to make a gene even stronger, so don't release monsties until you know if there's a gene you can transfer. 
You can use the ""X"" key while you're in the quest log to mark the location of monsties on your map if there's a side quest you can't find the location of.
 If you deal enough damage to a monster and it starts drooping down and drooling it gets the ""Tired"" status. It is a good time to use a paintball because there is a higher liklihood the monster is going to retreat (If it's retreatable) .
 Riding your monstie when you're afflicted with a status effect like blastblight, poison or electrified gets rid of the status condition completely without using an item, and switching monsties in battle can make your buddy use a different attack if he's going to lose the Head to Head. Kinship skills can also break monsters out of their final attack, or even ground dive. 
You can accept a quest at the job board multiple times by clicking enter when you go to the job board if there are quest rewards that you need multiples of.
 Reverto is not a rider, he's a hunter, so he deals non-elemental (raw) damage regardless of the enemies weakness. He is by far the strongest battle buddy, and you're best off supporting yourself and letting him go crazy with damage.
Hunting Horns are extremely strong, and are going to be necessary in the late game. Find one with the skill called Evasion Riff it blocks all damage for each member of your party for one attack and they are vital for upgrading in the late game
Also upgrading your weapon actually deals more damage to parts on the monster. It makes them easier to break. Upgrading weapons in the early game has almost no effect because you're going to be switching weapons in the early game so often that it's pointless to upgrade until you beat the story. 
Finally, Keep your old weapons. In the endgame if you upgrade them enough, they turn into higher rarity weapons so don't sell them for money because they upgrade easier than buying the rare ones already.

Finally I just want to give a couple notes to the developer that would make this game 5* from me. 
Firstly, I think you should make the house customizable. Allow basic furniture, or trophy displaying from certain kills in the game, I think it would be a way to get people more involved in designing their houses and make them play the game more. 
Next, I think that you should make the game one riding action per zone. The fact that I have to put every single riding action in my party in case I go to a zone where I need to ivy climb, and jump, and rock smash, etc means I can't customize my party the way I want to, I'm confined to have to use all the riding actions if I want all the items. 
Finally, have a multi-character progression system. Basically, have things you can transfer to another character. It would increase replayability in the game and allow for things like a new game + mode, instead of just making the monsters harder, this would be sort of an ultimate challenge with a sliding difficulty. There's not really much point to me starting another character beyond the first one, and this would give me a reason to play another character.

1184370,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",False,Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous - Enhanced Edition,"Sep 2, 2021","very good I put 50+ hours into this game and was largely enjoying it. There was enough that I really liked (e.g., a diverse array of class options, challenging encounters that required adaptation, etc.) that it was worth playing around some of the standing bugs that I ran into (e.g., in combat, sometimes having my healer waste their action because they didn't automatically move as part of the spell casting). 

Then I hit a game ending bug, also apparently a standing issue - the game stopped recognizing all keyboard controls. The usual fix didn't do the trick. I tried putting all the essential controls on my mouse, but then the game stopped recognizing those as well. And that was the end of my playthrough... as well as the end of my patience with Owlcat. 

I gave Pathfinder WotR a chance after also hitting a game ending bug on Kingmaker (after 130+ hours of play). I'm done giving Owclat the benefit of the doubt. They've lost me as player for good.

[spoiler] There is also a point in game when one Woljif, one of the playable companions runs away. Woljif was part of my main party, so I lost access to all of the items Woljif had equipped and had to rebalance my entire party. The game broke for me shortly after this, so I looked up whether Woljif comes back. The answer is apparently yes, but after a prolonged absence (i.e., you would have to redistribute items and rebalance the party again, after having to invest effort into building a companion you don't intend to stick with). I have no idea why they thought this was a remotely good idea. It doesn't add anything, other than frustration. [/spoiler] What a game!

I bought some titles per it, But I bought all titles bundle at last.
I hope and hope, next ""Capcom Consumer staduim"" Please Capcom! Classic arcade games that are still fun to play today. I really wanted to like Capcom Arcade Stadium — the idea of having a collection of classic arcade titles all in one place sounds great on paper. Unfortunately, the execution leaves a lot to be desired.

The emulation feels off, with noticeable input lag and inconsistent performance across different games. Even on solid hardware, frame pacing and slowdown issues pop up far too often. The CRT scan line filters are also underwhelming — even at 1440p, they look artificial and don’t capture the authentic arcade look.

It honestly comes across as another quick cash grab rather than a carefully crafted preservation effort. I’ve built PCs with better emulation setups in the past that run these same games smoother and with more accurate visuals.

Not worth my time here. Sorry, Capcom — this one just doesn’t hold up.

There are games about death, and then there’s Spiritfarer — a game about saying goodbye, not by fighting or killing, but by walking alongside others until they’re ready to let go.

[hr][/hr]

[h2] What I Loved [/h2]
[b]Spiritfarer is a hand-drawn masterpiece[/b] — yes, its animation is traditionally hand-drawn, frame by frame, and it shows in every movement and expression.

The game gently explores the lives of people who fell ill or suffered accidents, helping them complete what they couldn’t finish in life so they can depart in peace. [b]Emotionally powerful[/b] is an understatement — it had been a long time since a game made me cry like this.

The experience is long, calm, and meant to be savored slowly, truly embracing that [i]cozy[/i] feeling, with a soundtrack that will give you chills.

[hr][/hr]

[h2] What Could Improve [/h2]
Some tasks can become [b]repetitive[/b], especially late-game activities like watering plants or harvesting crops. A bit of automation at that stage would have helped.
A few quests lack clear guidance, and since the map is surprisingly large, this can lead to a lot of aimless wandering before figuring out what you’re missing.

The mission types in the main story boil down to some simple tasks where you break into a place and either steal or destroy a variety of items. I would say that this game fits perfectly in the sandbox and puzzle game genres. The main problem that I have with it are the timed missions. These will have you doing some task, but on a short timer. I don't think that these are very creative or fun, as the timer is so extremely short that there is only really one right 'answer'. The game engine itself seems capable of tons of creative missions, but they don't actually explore these options and instead make similar missions over and over. ""I need you to break into Y and fetch X. X is attached to an alarm, so when you touch it you have 60 seconds to get all of them across the whole map."" BORING. The other lame mission type is centered around an attack helicopter that follow you the whole mission. It is completely indestructible, even though you have access to a rocket launcher and on one map a literal AA cannon. The helicopter also never loses sight of you, and of course can shoot at and destroy most cover. What I'm saying is that you might as well be fighting God, as the pilot can see you at all times and can't be destroyed or even hindered in any way. These missions aren't really ""hard"" in the traditional way, mostly because of quicksaves, but they also aren't fun.

Bloodstainde: Ritual of the Night is everything Mighty Number 9 wanted to be.  This is a true blue castlevania game, but with a whole new universe to explore and learn about.  This is made by a famous creator who was instrumental in creating the original series this is based on, and this game lives up to all the promises that were made during the kickstarter campaign.

Now, taking the history of this game out of the equation, this is still a fantastic Metroidvania with fun writing, cool levels and map design, awesome abilities, and great controls.  On top of the usual metroidvania abilities and platforming, this game also includes a secondary ability system and an armor/weapon system that's combined with a cosmetics system, so everything you equip can also be seen on your character.  The secondary ability system is similar to the ability system in Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow, where when you kill an enemy, there is a chance you will obtain an equipable ability from them.  This has its pros and cons, as it's great there is so much content, but if you want something particular or to complete everything, you're in for a lot of grinding.

On top of the great main campaign, there are also additional modes to play.  Boss rush, speed-run, and a second campaign where you play as a boss going through the whole game.  There is a LOT of content in this game.

While this IS a great game, it isn't perfect.  The game is obviously lower budget as it doesn't look quite as nice as it could, even for when it came out.  On top of that, the game screen can be a little difficult to read the screen because the foreground (what you can use) and the background (just visuals) are sometimes not as distinct as they could be.  These shouldn't really detract from how great this game is, but every game has it's flaws.

 Good but still Mid.   6.5/10

Blasphemous is clearly made with a lot of care, especially in its art direction and overall tone. The visuals are striking and the atmosphere is heavy, but after a while it becomes too heavy. The constant themes of religious guilt and atonement are hammered in so relentlessly that they start to feel tiring rather than meaningful.

On the gameplay side, the combat feels tight and responsive, and the difficulty is mostly well balanced. These two attributes were my favorite parts. If you die once or twice, you arent expected to try try try again 40 more times. 

That said, I was disappointed by the lack of mechanics beyond a handful of upgrades. It feels closer to Castlevania (1986) than a modern evolution of the genre. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that, but I already played that game decades ago and I’ve moved on.

Overall, there’s nothing bad about Blasphemous. It’s a good game.

>Combat evolved, a mix of retro futuristic action survival (on legendary) that switch to horror game with an amazing campagain, art style etc. The og is also the best looking armor. Best game ever
>Halo 2 that had one of the best multiplayer ever, best controls. But to me the campaign was good but also already way off the style of halo 1. Great game nontheless
>Halo 3 - to 5 + that  missed remastered collection. Not interested althought i did play them.

TLDR: It's fun to play when it comes to weapons, combat etc. Balanced around heroic imo.
The campaign is just meh.

What about infinite? 
Well it's halo 2 with a bit more mechanics (sprint dodge etc) that are a fun addition. So there is a great gameplay at the core of this game.
Good: Weapon feeling, handling behavior are lifted from halo 2 so great to play, calls back to all my hours in halo 2. Dodge, shield, hook are fun. It's really feels halo in combat 
There are og halo 1 asset, like escape pods (but the iconic shotgun isn't there)

Meh: >Campaign is ridiculous, not that interesting (because a big part of the interesting stuff is off screen) and isn't finished when you roll credit. There is a lot of unexplained thing and main character that you don't see again from previous games (or died off screen maybe). The antagonist is just boring and annoying

>The full open world, Like with all the fobs you have an army of marines, but the campagin act like you're only three (you, ai, pilot). You get a lot of busy work that just allow you to unlock weapons and spawn vehicules.

The one advantage is i can just fight some random mob for rapid fun, rather than replay entire campaign of missions
>Everythings looks the same, copy pasted like other open worlds

Bad: There are some stuff that breaks the campain and gameplay to me
> I started the game on legendary, finished it on heroic: i didn't like legendary and to me it's way different  that in legendary in halo 1. Like random mobs  are okish but then you have bullet sponges bosses that one shot you and that you fight for 40 minutes. It really feels cheesy.
Heroic: mostly balanced with some cheese sometimes
> Too many boss encounters and way too spongy. Halo 2 had 1 spongy end game boss before you finish the game. He's a bullet sponge you kill him game done. 2 other ""bosses"" that are fine.
Here you have multiples campagin bosses that soak many many bullets and makes fight way too long and the game boring (your grenades and exploding stiff carries you a lot there). 
You can also do the optional bosses that have weapons unlock are your location.
>If you can't one shot hunters and you can't melee them, have to you all your grenades and ammo to kill maybe there is no point in there on crack elite counterpart.

 It does miss something I can't quite explain in detail. It doesn't quite feel like Halo. I miss the feeling I got when I played Halo 1 originally.

 FO3 is a fun game with great art direction, I loved it from the get go, but it's a terrible Fallout. Instead of exploring how society adapts and changes in the decades and centuries after the  apocalypse, it's a collection of post-apocalyptic tropes tied together with a thin plot and an antagonist recycled from the Interplay games. In order to recycle the antagonist, they placed the game 200 years after the bombs fell when in every way it seems to depict DC 20-50  years after the bombs fell. While the Interplay/Obsidian games show how society struggles and recovers, the Bethesda games show the post apocalypse as a cliche that never changes, an apocalyptic stasis that people are stuck in. And the RPG elements are relatively weak.

The gameplay largely consists on completing missions for your employer EXO, who will have you exploring 8 different planets looking for different materials, creating bases and vehicles, exploring caves and largely doing a lot of busy work, but the busy work in this game is probably the most fun busywork that you'll have in the genre, you also get some cute snails to help you out on your missions.

The crafting is a lot simpler compared to other games too, largely you'll only need like 2-4 nuggets of any materials to craft another item, sometimes you'll also have to synthetize new materials for more advanced recipes, and also gathering atmospheric gasses.

what really makes this game feel right compared to many other crafting and exploration focused games is the way it handles materials and interaction between the player and structures, it works by having little connection points that let you store items on practically anything, attach smaller structures to a platform, put an arm to automate processes and it really gives you a lot of agency with how you interact with crafting stations and lets you automate them in really simple ways, i enjoy it a lot and i'd say it's the best part about the game by far!

something i find notable is the lack of any sort of combat, which i've personally becomed acustomed to in most crafting survival games but, the only real dangers are managing your oxygen reserves and dealing with flora, as theres no fauna to speak of in any planet, while some might find this a deal breaker i actually found the lack of combat made the game a lot more engaging because you don't have to worry about micromanaging a system around it and can spend more time in the parts of the game that it does extremely well.

though its not perfect of course, one mechanic i find somewhat dissapointing is the terraformer tool, its useful as a cave exploration tool for digging and flattening ground and making ramps, but besides that its hard to make anything else besides this with it, theres a few upgrades that let you use it in different ways but it's a bit finnicky, works for its main purpose though.

while there IS a story i was admitedly not paying much attention to the text logs, as its all in text in the form of lost circuit parts, mysterious crystals, and train mission, i think it also deepens a bit in one of the dlcs 

Overall, its a lovingly put together game with support for over 10 years, if you wanna play a less stressful crafting focused game this game is perfect, Highly recommend.



 The animation for digging the role, and chill atmosphere, are great, the graphics runs so well in my pc,

I am always coming back to this game, because i always feel like a kid when i play it, i get fascinated with the new caves, and what could be down there.

632470,RPG,False,Disco Elysium - The Final Cut,"Oct 15, 2019","Some of the most intricate worldbuilding I've ever seen in a game. It's less a video game and more a detailed, interactive comic. The world feels so alive; everyone has something interesting and unique to say, and although some characters *act* a bit like a caricature, they all have hidden depth to them. There are real problems going on in the world around you, and you're able to make a tangible impact. It's very rewarding to help people around you. 

Minor spoilers ahead. 

Disco Elysium maintains an incredible balancing act between sincerity and insanity, between seriousness and comedy, between tension and release. There's even the dichotomy™️ between the player character's skill as a detective and his helplessness as a human being. He is known by a select number of npcs as the ""human can-opener"" due to his raw talent in being able to suss out a confession. But despite this, he knows next to nothing about himself.

I cannot overstate how much I enjoyed the story and the characters involved. The player character easily latches onto new and outlandish ideas - for example, you might become fixated with the idea of a legendary boxer, ""Contact Mike,"" you might attempt to seduce a single mother by convincing her that you're *more* of a drunk than her ex, or maybe you'll spend an entire day internally deconstructing an argument presented by a anthropometry-based racist in an effort to outwit him. My point is, these unique options lead you down unexpected paths, revealing the vivacity of the world around you and, personally, really heightening how enjoyable the game is. And best of all, they're incredibly interlinked! None of these weird tangents your character goes off on are ever self-contained. There's always (seemingly) a link between your actions and the overarching story.

At this point in the review, it should be obvious that I recommend playing this game. If you like being immersed in a story, solving puzzles, and especially if you're looking to obsess over a piece of media, then this game is for you.

There wasn't much I disliked about the game. I was definitely left wanting more when I reached the end, but not so much that I'd be willing to instantly jump in for another round. What it lacks in replayability it more than makes up for in memorability though. ""In dark times, should the stars also go out?""

448510,"Action, Casual, Indie, Simulation",False,Overcooked,"Aug 3, 2016","10/10 me and my friend spent 15 mins on one level because we couldnt stop crying and laughing from the pain. definitely recommend if u want to yell at ur friends Overcooked is the purest form of cooperative chaos I’ve played: a deceptively simple cooking game that turns into a hilarious, high-pressure teamwork simulator within minutes. The premise is straightforward—prepare dishes, plate them, and serve them fast—but the way it escalates makes every kitchen feel like a small emergency you’re barely surviving together.

What makes it special is how quickly it forces real communication. You can’t quietly “do your own thing” and expect success; you have to call out orders, coordinate tasks, and constantly adjust when something goes wrong. It’s not just about quick hands—it’s about shared priorities, timing, and knowing when to abandon a plan and improvise.

The level design is the star. Kitchens aren’t static rooms; they are puzzles in motion, with shifting platforms, splitting trucks, slippery ice, and layouts that actively sabotage your workflow. Each stage introduces a twist that changes how you think about the same basic actions, so the game stays fresh even though the controls remain easy to grasp.

Mechanically, Overcooked is clean and readable, which is crucial because the screen becomes a storm of plates, timers, and half-finished dishes. Chopping, cooking, washing up, and delivering all feel snappy, and the feedback is clear enough that mistakes usually feel like your fault rather than the game’s. When you pull off a perfect service streak, it genuinely feels earned.

Difficulty ramps in a way that’s exciting and, at times, brutally honest. A three-star run often demands near-perfect coordination, and the difference between “we’re fine” and “everything is on fire” can be about ten seconds. That said, the challenge is also what creates the best moments—those frantic rescues, clutch deliveries, and synchronized routines that make you feel like an actual kitchen team.

As a social game, it’s outstanding, but it comes with a warning label: it can reveal how people handle stress. With the right group, it’s nonstop laughter and triumphant shouting; with the wrong mix, it can become tense or blamey. It’s at its best with friends who can communicate, stay flexible, and treat failures as part of the joke.

If you want a co-op game that’s easy to learn, hard to master, and endlessly entertaining in short bursts, Overcooked is an easy buy. It’s not about long-term progression or narrative—it’s about the joy of coordinated panic and the satisfaction of turning disorder into a smooth rhythm. Bring patience, bring a sense of humor, and be ready to yell “WHO’S ON DISHES?” more than you ever thought possible.

be careful I've played Warframe for over 4,000 hours. I supported the game financially, bought cosmetics, and genuinely enjoyed the grind, the builds, the boss fights, and the community. But over the past 3 years, things have gone seriously downhill.

The devs introduced damage attenuation, a system that basically nerfs your DPS into the ground. Even in this update, there are still 5 viable one-shot builds (one using the Tornado augment), but generally, your 500 million damage build gets reduced to 50,000 against certain bosses. Why? Because they don’t want players one-shotting bosses.

Fine—but if you’re going to prevent us from nuking bosses, at least design bosses that are actually fun to fight. Not these dull bullet sponges with 1.5 predictable attacks and no unique mechanics.
There are great bosses in Warframe—Ropalolyst, Profit-Taker, Exploiter Orb, and Jackal. They have mechanics, phases, movement. But these new ones? Just health bars with legs.

The In-Game Economy Is a Joke Now
In just 2.5 years, Arcane Energize plummeted from 2,000 platinum to around 220. Inflation is bad enough in real life—I don’t want to see it in my escape too. Thank you, yearly Jade  update and event,

They’ve Killed Entire Activities:
Eidolon Hunting? Dead. (Yes, macros were a problem—but punishing the whole community wasn't the answer.)
Steel Path Disruption? Dead.
Void Cascade? Still alive, but a buggy mess + inflation = nope .

Warframe used to reward farming, improving, optimizing.  None of that really matters now . With damage attenuation, someone using an under-modded weapon can do similar damage to someone who spent hours fine-tuning their gear.

Yes, there are still 4–5 one-shot boss-killing builds that work.  Enjoy 4-player squads with random loadouts in Deep Archimedea taking forever to clear a boss—unless you happen to have that one friend with a cheese build to carry the run ( now you have to carry him for another Deep Archimedea  round ).

Instead of balancing or refreshing old content, DE keeps adding trash-tier weapons just to pad the Mastery Rank system. It feels like everything is catered to new players, while veterans are being pushed aside.

I never minded the grind. I liked it. Farming rivens, arcanes, or new skins just to kill things 0.1 seconds faster—that was the fun. But now? That motivation is gone.
I even built a big clan with an active Discord back in 2023. Now? No one wants to play anymore—including me.
DE chose to treat their long-time players like this. And I’ve made my choice too: I’m done.",0.6666666666666666,Awaken as an unstoppable warrior and battle alongside your friends in this story-driven free-to-play online action game,game

I recommend this game just beware of the story pacing. I loved playing through it, and it wont be the last time. I wanted something to relax, have a good time exploring Tokyo without being bored, and it does that perfectly.

1774580,"Action, Adventure",False,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"27 Apr, 2023","Fun game, performance wasn't great on 7800xt i712700kf. Had periods where it stuttered, had load in that was extremely visible. Didn't crash from memory. load times were quick enough. Gameplay is fun, somewhat step up from fallen order. Map exploration was... okay? I prefer the design in fallen order. I liked being able to explore and get health upgrades and things like that. the dungeons were cool in this one, but felt like the maps were sparse. love merin x cal. EA came so close to making a good Star Wars soulslike adventure game for the second time in a row. I'm somewhat baffled how so many annoying things from the first game where improved but so many were left unchecked. I'll add a warning before any major spoilers for either this or Fallen Order. 

First of all, to be fair, they made many improvements. The little animations when you find loot or use rest points/workbenches/etc. can eat up a lot of time; they are unnecessary and this game did a good job of shortening them. For example: I don't need a 3-second animation of Cal staring at the lightsaber I was just customizing... I'm going to see it for hours in-game. 

Also, having companions engage in combat and interact with the world is a huge plus. In Fallen Order, they literally just stand around the ship while you do everything. It makes no sense. I'm glad they use the companions well in this game. 

I think the most MAJOR improvement is the perk system. I can't believe this needed to be said, but cosmetic collectibles are POINTLESS. If people enjoy that, great, but there's no sense of pride for me in finding 90 different poncho colors. If I'm spending time looking for stuff, I want it to matter in the game.

On the other hand, that's immediately walked back by the sheer quantity of stuff in this game. Not interactions, not story variations, not anything remotely interesting... just ""stuff."" Bloat. Nonsense. Time-wasting collectibles and barterable goods that ultimately get you a handful of game-enhancing things, but then... you're shopping for collectibles. And I know I said the animations were shortened, but there are SO MANY MORE. There's a significantly higher quantity of detours and quasi-cutscenes and it all just amounts to ""stuff."" Go over here, look at this stuff. Go over there, pick up that stuff. Look at that new colorful stuff you got! Hey, check out this fun stuff happening that you can't interact with! Isn't all this STUFF neat?

Except all the ""stuff"" they packed into this game doesn't change the fact that all you've been doing is scaling walls and jumping on platforms. I keep finding myself asking ""where are the fights?"" and ""where are the puzzles?"" and ""okay, can we MOVE ON already?"" so many times. 

Spoilers for both games ahead:

The main reason I have a critical problem with all the little distractions and cosmetic items in this game is because they are exactly that: distractions. The story is menacingly stupid in how it presents its own premise. Cal wants to find this mysterious hidden world called Tanalorr so that he and his loved ones can escape the Empire and live there in peace. Meanwhile Cal is also wrestling with whether or not he wants to give up fighting the Empire in the first place. 

That's a decent hook if you never watched any Star Wars movies but even then, the whole ""Cal isn't sure if he even wants to run away while searching for a world to run away to"" aspect needs to be considered. That's like buying a plot of land and hiring a builder to build you a house, and only AFTER do you decide if you want to live there. Okay. Anyway, if he wants to FO and leave the fight, why does anyone need this hidden secret world? Seriously, these writers have never seen Star Wars. 

And now we've arrived at the core issue: other than lightsabers, stormtroopers, and the presence of the Jedi, this game wants nothing to do with Star Wars as a concept. It isn't creatively thinking beyond the established canon, it's just ignoring it. Fallen Order did this to a similar extent... that entire game fixates on the Zeffo, an ancient alien civilization that is not rooted in existing lore and connect to it in any meaningful way. Everything we know about Star Wars and the Jedi is in Column A, and here are the Zeffo in Column B. 

However, that story's redeeming quality is that there is a SIGNIFICANT NEED to care about the Zeffo. One way or another, they were the only ones capable of creating an impervious Force-dependent vault that was used to conceal the names of Force-sensitive children who could rebuild the Jedi. FINE, I can make my peace with that. The list of Force-sensitives is needed, so all this roundabout stuff with the Zeffo is acceptable. 

But in Survivor, the entire premise is just a non-starter. The second Cal and company start talking about their quest to find Tanalorr, I'm immediately reminded that they all forgot they live in the Star Wars universe because the writers don't care about Star Wars, where there are thousands of worlds that are wild and vast and unexplored. Remember in Episode 5 when there was an entire plotline about a Jedi successfully hiding from the Empire until he died of old age? I'm gonna go on a limb and say that Jedi was a bigger target for the Empire than Chad from Malcolm in the Middle AKA Cal Kestis. And what was the name of that other super important Jedi who successfully hid for about 20 years and only revealed himself when he was ready to pass the torch to his apprentice? I'm not saying Dagobah and Tattooine are prime real estate, but those are two top-of-mind examples that don't require special hidden knowledge and a bunch of lore-adjacent stuff that only matters in this one standalone story.

Anyway... overall, my feelings are mixed. This game is definitely fun to play, but I wish they spent development capital and resources on the story and ironing out the 7,000 glitches I've encountered within the first few hours instead of devoting so much energy into all the different loot and collectibles and bartering systems needed to style Cameron Monaghan's hair.

I don't need to say too much, just look at the other reviews.

Without a doubt, you have to spend a little time getting to grips with it and adjusting the settings. 
Check out tutorials and you will understand how it works.

Who wouldn't want to play Cyberpunk 2077 and other performance-hungry titles at over 100+ FPS without upgrading their graphics card?
Here is the solution. 

Ok...well, that's only half the truth, because it's not absolutely perfect - true. And it doesn't replace a good graphics card completely. But for many people and gamers out there this tool could be an absolute game changer - I am such a person who benefits from it. 

My work PC and my notebook are much more powerful than my gaming PC, because I have to make compromises. This tool, together with GeForceNow, fills that gap. I'm not investing much in hardware at the moment until prices stabilise - It's so ridiculous and painful at the same time. 

Back to the topic:
LosslessScaling belongs in the Hall of Fame. 

Buy it and try it out. 
The price is low for what you can achieve with it. I don't normally review software, I bought this on sale along with Doom The Dark Ages. Their stupid ass ray tracing requirement is killing my 6650 XT, was getting 48 fps even on the lowest settings with FSR Balanced. Built in FSR frame gen did absolutely nothing. I realized I went and bought Lossless Scaling too, so I tried it out. Holy hell guys, this software is absolutely incredible. Fixed setting was EXTREMELY noticeable, with frame gen was getting 60 to 80fps. I was expecting the input lag to be bad but honestly, it's not that bad. Surprisingly playable! Even if a little noticeable. I then tried the adaptive setting which performed MUCH better and cut back on the input lag a bit too. 


I don't believe in conspiracies, but I genuinely believe this method of frame gen is purposely being held back by AMD and Nvidia simply to sell more GPUs. Yes, it's not a perfect technology but this program outclasses their methods by a wide margin.

In conclusion, best $4.89 I ever spent. 10/10 program. MUST BUY if you have an older GPU struggling and you don't mind very minor, but playable input lag. I can not give enough credit to the developers, this isn't magic by any means but it is the closest to ""free performance"" I have ever seen.",0.42857142857142855,All-in-one gaming utility for frame generation and scaling,game

It's not hard, it's not fun, it's tedious. Hold right click on an enemy until it pops and then shoot it 2-6 times depending on difficulty level. Difficulty just changes how many times you have to click on an enemy. I got about half way through the game and there was only ever 2 types of enemy, a guy that takes 2 hits, and a guy that takes 4 hits.

The only difficulty to the game comes from the enemies swarming you and the fact that you can't do anything to them until you put light on them for long enough. The camera control is bad, and it is made worse by the fact that the game twirls the camera around the area *every* time an enemy spawns in. You walk into an area, it's clearly going to be a place where enemies will come in, and then the camera twirls around to show off that enemies have spawned.

And the worst part? The devs don’t explain any of it.
How do you get these things? Where do you find them? Why should you care? Do I even need them? Should I farm for them? Is it worth the effort? None of it is clear. So... why bother?

Then when I do get something new — a relic, emblem, ring, chain, stone, prism, etc. etc. — I have no idea what to do with it.
Is it for a weapon? For a tower?

[h1] Steam Deck [/h1]
I played 100% on Steam Deck and had no issues. Controller isn't as precise as mouse + keyboard when it comes to shooting (headshots are really important) but I usually chose my build to focus on traps and guardians instead to mitigate that. 

[h1] Achievements [/h1]
Some will unlock just playing the game normally, but a lot require you to use specific traps in specific scenarios, or even no traps at all. Going for the achievements made me try a lot of things I may not have used otherwise, which is perfect for a game like this. 

The difficulty based achievements are in a bit of a weird balance. There are three difficulties: Apprentice, War Mage, and Nightmare, and while Nightmare is certainly the hardest, I actually had more problems in War Mage. There is an achievement that requires you to 5-star all the levels on War Mage, which requires you to never die, your core to take 0 damage, and to finish within a strict time limit. 

Nightmare, while far more difficult to complete, doesn't require you to 5-star anything, just to complete it. I completed some of the Nightmare levels very sloppily and still got past, where trying to 5-star the same level on War Mage could get sweaty. Not a complaint necessarily, and 5-starring everything on War Mage was great training for doing Nightmare in that regard, just an odd achievement difficulty balance without a similar achievement to 5-star Nightmare.",1.0,"Slice them, burn them, skewer them, and launch them - no matter how you get it done, orcs must die in this fantasy action-strategy game from Robot Entertainment.",game

The old Stalker games feel much more snappy and precise in comparison. The aiming for some reason just feels incredibly slippery and choppy.

On higher difficulties you don't see enemies just getting more and more health like other games. They get better gear, are more accurate, employ more technique.

It seems like there are more mutants on higher difficulties as I will find clusters of burners in some areas. I fought off 15 of them and spent way too much money doing it. Snorks galore... So, picking your battles is very important like previous games.

It's a lot like Valheim.

253960,Adventure,False,Jack Orlando: Director's Cut,"4 Oct, 2013","Jack Orlando: Director’s Cut, developed by Toontraxx Studios and published by Topware Interactive, is a vintage point-and-click adventure that exudes the smoky atmosphere and moral ambiguity of a classic 1930s noir. Set in a world of crime, corruption, and forgotten heroes, it follows the titular private detective, Jack Orlando—a down-on-his-luck investigator framed for murder—through a desperate forty-eight-hour search to clear his name. The game seeks to channel the style of golden-age Hollywood detective films, and while it certainly captures the era’s visual flair and tone, it also inherits the uneven design sensibilities of its time, resulting in a fascinating yet deeply flawed experience.

From the very beginning, the game’s atmosphere is unmistakably its strongest asset. The art direction is richly detailed, with every frame painstakingly hand-drawn and painted to evoke the gritty charm of Depression-era America. The streets are lined with flickering neon signs, grimy alleyways, and dimly lit bars that set the perfect stage for a noir mystery. Complementing this visual design is a superb jazz-infused score by Harold Faltermeyer, the composer best known for the “Beverly Hills Cop” theme, whose work gives the game an unmistakable cinematic texture. The soundscape and art direction succeed in immersing the player in a world that feels both melancholy and alive—one that could easily have been the setting of a Humphrey Bogart film.

Unfortunately, while the game’s style and setting are excellent, the substance of its gameplay struggles to meet the same standard. Jack Orlando is built on the classic adventure formula: you explore environments, collect items, and solve puzzles that lead you closer to unraveling the central conspiracy. The problem lies in the logic—or lack thereof—behind many of its puzzles. Solutions often require leaps of reasoning that border on the absurd, forcing players to combine unrelated items or revisit obscure locations for reasons that make little narrative sense. Some puzzles are structured in ways that make failure possible, even permanent, meaning you can easily lock yourself out of progress without realizing it. This kind of design, common in 1990s adventure titles, demands persistence and trial-and-error patience, but today it feels frustratingly opaque.

The narrative itself has all the ingredients for a compelling noir mystery—a cynical detective, double-crosses, and a city full of suspects—but the storytelling falters in execution. The writing lacks the sharpness and wit expected from a noir tale, and the dialogue often feels clumsy or awkwardly translated. The English localization, in particular, suffers from uneven phrasing and stilted voice acting that frequently undercuts dramatic moments. While Jack himself has the right weary tone for a washed-up detective, many supporting characters come across as flat caricatures rather than complex personalities. The pacing, too, can drag, with long stretches of aimless wandering between static backgrounds that offer little narrative payoff. It’s a game that relies heavily on its mood to carry you through the rougher moments—and while that atmosphere works, it can only do so much to compensate for the lack of storytelling cohesion.

The Director’s Cut edition, released years after the original, sought to improve upon these flaws by adding new scenes, rebalanced puzzles, and a more streamlined experience. It’s a welcome effort, but even with these updates, the game still feels like a product of its time. The improvements make the pacing slightly more tolerable and remove some of the most illogical dead ends, yet the core mechanics and design philosophy remain stubbornly old-fashioned. Still, for players who appreciate vintage adventure design, there’s a certain charm in its rough edges. Its slow pace and methodical investigation style can be immersive if approached with the right mindset—one that values ambiance over convenience.

In terms of technical performance, the Steam version runs well on modern systems, though it retains the low-resolution visuals and 4:3 aspect ratio of its 1990s origins. Its age shows, but there’s something appealing about its pixel-perfect backgrounds and painterly environments that modern remasters often lose in translation. The user interface, while simple, can be unintuitive, especially when dealing with the game’s inventory system, which lacks modern conveniences like item highlights or contextual hints. These limitations, however, are part of the retro charm for players accustomed to classic adventure quirks.

Ultimately, Jack Orlando: Director’s Cut is a game that fascinates as much as it frustrates. It’s a richly atmospheric journey through a world of corruption and melancholy, anchored by beautiful visuals and a phenomenal soundtrack. But it’s also bogged down by archaic design choices, awkward dialogue, and uneven pacing that can test even the most patient of players. It’s a relic of a bygone era of adventure gaming—an ambitious, moody experiment that captures the feel of noir storytelling better than it executes it. For enthusiasts of classic point-and-click adventures or fans of noir aesthetics, it remains a curio worth experiencing for its artistry and tone. For others, it serves as a reminder of how far adventure games have evolved since the days when style and frustration often walked hand in hand.

Pro:
- Uuuuunglaub viel zu tun. Es gibt immer etwas zu machen. Egal ob craften, bauen oder Monster und Bosse erlegen. Es wird einem nie langweilig 
- Kampfsystem sehr geil
- Fähigkeiten sehr cool, man kann sich aussuchen ob man ne  Nahkampf Maschine sein will, Zauberer mit Hut und Stab oder witzigerweise auf einem reitenden Drachen oder sogar mit Kammpfhubschrauber oder Panzer kämpfen will. Für jeden was dabei 
- Inventar soooo unglaublich gut. Selten gesehen, dass man zB 30 Dinge mit der rechten Maustaste auswählt und mit einem Klick in die Kiste haut.
- automation, crafting und farming alles sehr sehr vielfältig. Es gibt 1000 Dinge zu machen.
- Map, Gebiete und Bosse sehr geil in verschiedene, schöne Regionen unterteilt. 
- Mini Dungoens mit Rätseln 
- gibt wirklich noch 100 Sachen die Ma hier auflisten könnte.

Contra:
- unglaublich viele Bugs. Laut steam- und Redditcommunity wird an dem Game nicht mer gearbeitet, bzw nur sehr fade. Was ich sehr schade finde.
- klettern ist so nervig. Man benötigt es zwar für 90% der map um überall hin zu kommen, jedoch klettert man oft ungewollt an bäumen oder sogar an Gegner rum, was sehr nervig ist.
- sehr wenig graphic settings 
- movement sehr clunky. Bin leider einer der wenigen auserwählten, die den movement bug haben, bei dem mein Charakter nach dem loslassen der Sprinttase für ne halbe Sekunde stehen bleibt. Laut Com. nichts zu machen. Ist Sache der Devs, das zu fixen
- trotz sehr schöner und ausgeprägter Map und Welt ist doch sehr viel „Luft“ dazwischen. Man rennt und rennt und bis auf ein paar kleine Kisten und Pflanzen gibt’s nichts zu holen. Etwas fade.
- Caves sind alle gleich, bis auf das Ende der Cave. Keine varianz drin leider.
- ohne Quality of life Mods auch echt anstrengend manchmal zu spielen. Wer das liest, bevor er das spiel spielt, ladet euch mods runter im Workshop. Es erleichtert euch sehr viel.

Und größter negativer Punkt: wie schon oben genannt, arbeiten die Devs kaum noch an dem Spiel, was unglaublich schade ist. Es is ein Meisterwerk und könnte, wenn mal alles gefixt wird, jedes Open-World-Craft-Adventure Game um Längen überholen. Allein durch die Vielfalt, was man hier alles machen kann.

 I'm calling this game a definite love letter and one up. It's in early access, has some flaws, and needs work, but I am having a ball. There is already plenty to do and practice up on while this game is tinkered with by the developer. Sure, Palworld is taking up a lion's share of priority, but Palword exploded when it came out and is every bit as good as the hype claims. These two games fill in all the missed opportunities and potential for the games they pay homage to. If you have a clear understanding of what 'Early Access' entails, and can play games, that lead you a little bit, but not by the nose. You will have a lot of fun with this game. Do understand that a lot of the dialogue is poorly translated, but again, welcome to early access. These things will get ironed out in the moments when the devs are able to come up for air working on the game that is paying bills and putting food on their families tables. Where I got bored in that 'other game', this is far from. I am having an incredible amount of fun after getting passed some of rough around the edges parts in the beginning moments of the game, but reminded myself that it is all par per course, when it comes to eatly access, and I seen games in early access for longer than this as well. I saw this game called, 'The Best Bad Game'. Its not a bad game, its just in early access, where it should be. And its too much fun to be called bad. We need more people to add their positive reviews, in spite of all the other run of mill, negative nancy reviews you tend to see carbon copied everywhere. Is every going to like this game? No. Should it get a fair shake? Yes. I cannot think of many games that everyone likes. This one is no different, but give it a chance and don't immediately shut down as some negative reviews will have trained you to and you just might find yourself in my shoes: having fun and appreciating the scope of this game and also the importance of this game and its little brother. You can't have your cake and eat it too, 'other gaming company', There are other talented studios out there that are going give you a run for your money and provide the masses with great games, This one just has a way yet to yet, but as I said, fair critiques, helpful feedback, will keep the dev in the game and not feel overwhelmed, which they surely are.

the gameplay is top notch like a Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden meets dark souls but with an anime underworld theme. you feel powerful like if you just hone your knowledge and reaction time you could beat a boss with non stop aggression, you dont get that ""taking turns"" feeling like in a fromsoftware title and if you do its cause you arent playing as optimally as you could be.

if you want more mechanically demanding fromsoftware game with better combat this is it; although it does lack a little in atmosphere and map design by comparison.

 This game is phenomenal. Around the 40 hour mark I started to feel a bit of burnout, but once everything came together near the end, I was fully reinvigorated and even went back to finish the side content I had skipped. Finding out there are multiple endings added a lot of weight to the experience, and the story’s climax is top tier. I am really glad I gave this game a chance.

The gameplay is the best I have experienced in any soulslike. I ran dual wield the entire time and never touched the two hander or spear. The speed, the visceral flow of abilities, and the freedom to weave light and heavy attacks felt incredible. Most of the time the game offers a clear path forward with minimal backtracking, although a few areas look similar enough that I briefly got turned around.

Boss fights are consistently excellent and very satisfying. Side quests were enjoyable, but they contributed to my mid game burnout. They reminded me of Nioh’s optional missions where you revisit familiar areas with small changes. I liked encountering elite enemies, but I wish there were more variants. Eventually, non boss encounters started to feel repetitive.

The skill and gear systems strike a great balance. They are deep enough for min maxing but never overwhelming. Think Diablo 3 or Torchlight, accessible and rewarding without needing a spreadsheet.

Defy Gravity Extended – A Simple Arcade Game with Addictive Challenge [/h3]

[code] [quote=Wendrex] 🚀 Introduction

Defy Gravity Extended, developed by Paul Fisch, is a great example of how a simple concept can deliver a highly engaging experience. What starts as a minimalist arcade game quickly turns into a tense, challenging, and deeply rewarding journey that keeps you coming back for more.

⭐ Gameplay Highlights

The gameplay is tight, responsive, and extremely well-polished. Controlling the ship feels precise, allowing players to focus entirely on navigating dangerous levels filled with hazards and split-second decisions.

Each stage pushes your reflexes and timing, encouraging improvement through repetition rather than frustration. Level design stays fresh and cleverly escalates the challenge without feeling unfair.

🎨 Graphics, Soundtrack & Immersion

Visually, the game embraces a clean and minimalist art style that perfectly suits its arcade nature. Visual clarity is excellent, which is crucial during high-speed moments.

The soundtrack enhances immersion by maintaining tension and focus, supporting the gameplay rather than overpowering it.

🔥 Difficulty & Learning Curve

The learning curve is fair but demanding. The controls are easy to understand, yet true mastery requires precision, patience, and practice.

Difficulty increases steadily, making each completed level feel genuinely earned and satisfying.

🎯 What Makes It Fun and Addictive

Fast and responsive gameplay

Short levels that encourage repeated attempts

Strong sense of personal improvement

Skill-based challenge instead of luck

These elements combine to make Defy Gravity Extended highly addictive and perfect for both short play sessions and longer runs.

✅ Final Verdict

Defy Gravity Extended is an excellent choice for fans of challenging arcade games focused on skill and precision. It’s simple, fair, and incredibly fun — a game that proves great design doesn’t need complexity.

⭐ Highly recommended!

214490,Action,False,Alien: Isolation,"6 Oct, 2014","an Amazing stealth horror that overstays its welcome.

Halfway through my playthrough even when having fun, I was like “when does this game end bro”, it’s certainly too long for what it is and that’s my biggest grip, the pacing is very inconsistent and some objectives feels unnecessary for the plot and are just there to add more playtime. I feel like if it was about 8 - 10 hours long It would’ve been alot better and much more replayable.

Aside from its length, i like this game. The story is good, nothing crazy but it’s interesting enough to go through it, Filed with cool characters that are fleshed out just enough to serve a purpose.

The gameplay is okay, the combat is fine but they’re both not top tier, so don’t come in expecting something like resident evil 4, it plays a lot more like outlast but far deeper and more engaging, rather than just running away, expect to shoot a few people (or aliens and killing machines) along the way, you’re not completely hopeless but you would feel like it throughout the entire game.

The puzzles are another weak point, they’re far too simple and can be solved by putting the least amount of effort into it. Did they honestly think pulling down levers and some QTE’s was good enough to be considered a puzzle? It’s not an issue but it would be nice to do something that requires me to use my high iq Harvard brain (lie) sometimes. 

By far the biggest standout is the stalker enemy, the xenomorph did not disappoint in any way, I anticipated him to be the next Mr X and he absolutely was. The game shines whenever he’s around, the constant feeling that he’s behind you and the way he hears and punishes any noise you make truly makes him one of the best stalkers ever, he will not let you go, he’ll search the whole ship and every hiding spot just to kill you.

It’s not just the stalker that’s unique, the joes serve their purpose to the fullest, making you feel hopeless knowing that you can’t kill them unless you empty your revolver. The game encourages you to run away and it executed this tactic in a way that feels entertaining rather than making me feel fatigued.

Overall alien isolation is a good game that would’ve been much better if it wasn’t as long as it is, all of its other flaws would be negligible if it wasn’t for that but the cheer scope of it is what makes these issues standout. 7.25/10, get it on a discount. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3442476751 https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3442476802 it's cool but i get extremely nauseated playing it. i have turned off motion blur and lowered my sensitivity. idk whats causing it",1.0,"Discover the true meaning of fear in Alien: Isolation, a survival horror set in an atmosphere of constant dread and mortal danger.",game

8.5/10 very fun and not too fast paced It does everything I wished the PS2 Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets game should have had but couldn't do to hardware limitations and such when I was was a snot nosed little bitch. The only flaw is why would I want a Dobby clone for a man servant? Why couldn't JK Rowling keep elves as the estrogen filled femboys as they were in everything else instead of making them look like inbred offspring of goblins? The goblins have more hair and better appearances than the meth head elves which raises more questions than answers.

Now that the minor gripes are out of the way, the gunplay and RPGification of it is great and it's basically what borderlands SHOULD be, and even though there's only a few different types of enemy per each stage there's always enough of each type thrown in for the encounters to feel challenging and fresh each time. Modifiers on enemies feel way better than diablo (and most ARPGs with enemy mofifiers) and the gun variety isn't overwhelming but always feels fresh.
TLDR; underwhelming lack of level variety and a kinda bad translation but if you like rougelite character skill based looter shooters or ARPGs you can play with friends this is a MUST have, it's everything borderlands wishes its base gameplay was and more. a very nice and challenging game that i recommend a lot ! + if you want to practice your aim tracking, this game offer a really smooth tracking experience.

A heartwarming short story and parkour game in the style of ""Arthur and the Minimoys"". We play the main character's childhood memories as he explains his longing and admiration for his uncle. As an uncle (a proud one), this concept satisfied me.

287390,Action,False,Metro: Last Light Redux,"Aug 25, 2014","if you want survival horror stress then play this Yes play it if you like stalker Despite the superb environmental design, created based on real places in Russia (mainly the metro systems), I clearly remember the detail that won me over: An abandoned station, a perfect portrait of apocalyptic decay; vines growing through cracks in the cement, moss, small insects and strange animals, unique mutations from that narrative. I remember entering a small room with a collapsed roof, just casually exploring the ruins looking for air filters, and then, a random decomposing body on the floor greets me with flies landing on my mask. The sound, the care with the details for the faithful representation of the decay of death... I was so stunned I could almost smell it.

The game knows how to play with your paranoia, especially in open areas. The post-apocalyptic landscape is breathtaking. Monster sounds keep your weapon drawn at all times, flooded buildings bring an oppressive and claustrophobic feeling of discomfort and fear. And the swamps? Falling into any deep water is an absolute horror; it's a game that, despite being linear, shows you that world is alive independent of your presence. Erratic, wet, and decomposed terrain combined with pure darkness defines much of this incredible atmosphere. Combat is satisfying, stealth is rewarding, and going into action is phenomenal.

Running out of air due to a lack of filters can be annoying? Yes. But this element is part of the game's oppressive composition: Everything is made to destabilize you as a player, to make you desperate and anxious. Many times I found myself in agony, firing shotgun shells randomly at creatures while running, searching for any mercy from a corpse with any abandoned filter.

I have never before played a game that knows how to play with sensations and primal instincts as strongly as Metro 2033. As I write this, I have just bought the book that inspired the game.

I’ve poured thousands of hours into Diablo, PoE, and multiple other ARPGs — and out of all of them, Last Epoch strikes the best balance between depth, fun, and sanity.

It’s got the build variety of Path of Exile, but without needing a 40-tab spreadsheet or YouTube degree just to make a character that works. The skill trees are awesome — they’re deep, creative, and actually *change* how your abilities play. Plus, the crafting system is hands down the best in the genre: simple enough to use right away, deep enough to chase perfect gear later. 

And gameplay-wise? It just feels good. Combat is tight, hits are satisfying, and performance is way smoother than what we’ve been getting from some *massive* studios lately. It’s also super refreshing that the devs clearly care more about the player experience than pushing FOMO events or “live service” nonsense.

About the recent review bombing — honestly, it’s pretty unfair. Most of it comes from people upset about monetization changes. The actual game, the one you play day to day, hasn’t changed. It’s still one of the most polished, replayable, and genuine ARPGs out there.

The Goods :-

- The gameplay loop is amazing, dropping down to kill bugs/robots/squids and do different objectives whilst also expecting the unexpected makes it fresh for gameplay

- The plethora of weapons/stratagems gives diverse gameplay without it feeling ""meta"" , although this does take some time to unlock them. 

- The movement in this game (despite some bugs and glitches here and there) feels solid, down to earth and grounded.

The Bads : - 

- The performance of this game is abysmal. My frames only average around 45FPS and dips to around 30FPS during combat. I've tried every fix I can find but to no avail, I'm running quite a good rig (RTX3060Ti/I5-12600/32GB RAM) so I'm not sure what the issue here is, so I'll wait for Arrowhead to do thier magic, if they do tend on doing anything about.

Even nine years later, this game looks fantastic. The TV aspect I could have done without, though Lance Reddick was a standout in that part of the game. Overall, if you liked Remedy's other games, you gotta check this one out. This is a great game!
Love the action, but the story is in that Remedy-verse. Sci-fi mystery with a focus on time travel this go round. The abilities are awesome, the area puzzles aren't too complex, but still fun to solve. I think you can see a lot of what Control and in some ways Alan Wake 2 evolved from right here.
I've seen some complaints about the Junction points, but I think a lot of people might like it. You essentially get a 20 minute episode of the game that changes depending on your choices. Some just want to play constantly and don't care much for the story, but if you do, this is worth your time.
My only caveat is that the port isn't the best, so wait for a sale. I thought my PC was a decade beyond the requirements so I'd be good, but there just aren't enough options in the video and audio to get this running just right.

If you’ve ever wondered what it feels like to be both a landlord and the government’s nosiest employee, Beholder is here to crush your soul—in a very entertaining way.

You play as Carl Stein, a perfectly normal guy whose job description includes fixing leaks, spying on tenants, planting bugs, reporting suspicious behavior, and occasionally deciding who goes to prison (no pressure). The game politely asks you moral questions like:
👉 Do you report the family for owning an apple?
👉 Do you save your kid… or pay the electricity bill?

Every decision feels important, stressful, and somehow wrong. You start the game thinking, “I’ll play smart and stay neutral.” Two hours later, you’re broke, your family hates you, and you’re hiding contraband in the bathroom while the clock screams at you.

The art style is dark, minimal, and perfectly matches the atmosphere—everyone looks tired, scared, or guilty… including you. The soundtrack quietly reminds you that freedom is optional and consequences are mandatory.

Don't get why peoble are so mad, if they began to read the devblogs they would know pve and open world isn't forgot. But pvp and gameplay mechanícs, and off couse stress tested servers that can handle high populated traffic is the devs main prioty. ""But it take ages! I want open world and PVE now!"" Yeah i get that. But this game isnt made by a AAA+ studio. and the resources are limit, things like that dosen't help the situation either, and that's why the devs have to priotize what is most important. Keep the good work guys! Ignore the mad audience and finnish this hidden gem. 

Pros:
+Alot of replay value
+Intense PVP action
+Great maps
+Great sounds
+Great community

Cons:
-Bots needs some work. 
-Too few maps
-Hit reg seems abit off sometimes

Hyped for:
!Open World Survival - Maybe something like Miscreated or Escape from Tarkov style
!New maps
!Pve content
!New game modes
!Upcoming updates
 Just another crappy F2P shooter, but with a superficial resmblance to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise.  There is no free roam, no looting and no storyline.  I don't know what survarium means or why this is tagged as survival, it should be called ""Team Deathmatch-arium""

The online queue is broke or bugged, after waiting a minute plus the game will ""find a match"" but it just stays on the home screen and beeps, the bot practice mode (the only PvE option) works but it has zero progression rewards so all I can do is play bots in my lousy starting gear for no gain, or queue, wait, relog and repeat.

The shop seems like your typical F2P whale hunt, a few dull items you can grind for (IDK how bad the grind is because of the afformentionded queue bug), and tons of shiny cash-only items the wallet warriors can get right now. Great Game! 

+Nice Setting, really like the Stalker-theme
+ not P2W (you can get everytrhing buy just playing the game, leveling up as a free user is fast)
+Good gunplay (weapons feel the right way)
+Good Support (answering within 24h, very polite)
+Reasonable price tags, no 200€ op weapons or anything

The only problem is the low playercount - you q for about 2-3min every time. Give this game a chance, it's great!

I didn't rightly [i]know[/i] what I was getting into here.  I have no prior experience with CDPR games, so the writing took me by surprise.  If I had to expect anything, it would have been another Skyrim - a long list of checkboxes to tick and a rote, tired gameplay loop that gets boring as quickly as you reach the end of it, padded out by bullet sponge enemies or simply making you [i]walk farther.[/i]  A bunch of faceless, soulless PG-13 robots that exist to push you along to the next theme park ride.  But that's not at all what we've got here, not by a long shot.

I look at this, look at the hours I've put in here, in what feels like such a small amount of time, and I do not consider one minute of that time wasted.  Of course, there were issues, but they were so infrequent that experiencing the issues themselves stood out to me.  The fact that any occurred at all made me realize how seldom they happened.  There is no 'filler' here.  Everything that exists does so for a purpose, and of the time spent just going from A to B, there was always something fun to do in between, whether that was some kind of side-thing, or just the movement itself.  Everything was done fantastically.  Of the issues I had throughout my time with this game, all of them were either forgotten or resolved themselves before the end.

Nothing here is half-finished or cut short, the game's lore doesn't just exist stuffed away in audio or text logs - though there are plenty of the latter if you like reading.  Some things just end on a cliffhanger.  Things you're never meant to know, maybe.

This game isn't the kind you can make a sequel to, I don't think.  At least not for another decade or so, give or take some kind of narrative epiphany.

The story was written by people who understand how people speak, and did not pull punches for the sake of pleasing either the player themselves or the PC in-universe.  There [i]are[/i] cases where you have to make decisions and you cannot do everything you can possibly want in one playthrough.  There are decisions with consequences that will affect how you play, and more importantly, how you [i]feel[/i].  You can savescum of course, but the only one you're cheating is yourself.  Robbing yourself of the experience you've just invested hours into seeing through.  This is not a game for the guy who wants to save everyone.  There's no all-seeing god looking over you to lower your score at the end for killing people instead of knocking them out.  There's just you, the world, and your conscience.

The topics covered in this game's story, among other things it holds, have always been extremely interesting to me in particular.  There are so many parallels here to things I've personally dealt with in my life, things I've already had to consider, problems I've solved or thought I had solved, now staring me right back in the face, in a way that seems as real as any sort of digital ""reality C"" can possibly ever be.  It may as well be real, with how it f-cks with my head.  I guess that's just art, isn't it?

This game made me change as a person, for the better.  Sounds dramatic, but that's the truth.  Through all the sci-fi bullsh-t, I see bits of myself in this thing.  I have walked away with new, perception-altering experiences tucked away somewhere in my brain, to inform my behavior down the line, am I to ever find my way into these situations again.

Maybe now I'll put together what being alive means.  I've got the pieces right in front of me - Disco, NITW, and the rest from my time in meatspace.

Impatient, stupid, difficulty with recognizing patterns, I'm not sure. And although I made it further each attempt, I'm not going to waste my time any further.

The game unfolds progressively and isn't overtly challenging, but the ""connecting bits"" of certain tools, concepts, and ideas seem to unfold well over the course of the story, but the controls of the jetpack are often frustrating, the platforming is often obnoxious, and the timed puzzle experience (having to get into a specific small-ass room within one minute of Groundhog Day-ing) were all extremely annoying gameplay loops that I didn't find enjoyable.

So why am I not giving this game a bad review?

That's not to say there isn't silly moments, exploration, and ultraviolent fun to be had, there is PLENTY of that as well, but it is always kept in balance with a solid plot that isn't afraid to have serious moments.

New Vegas drops you in a civil war between the New California Republic, a wealthy but struggling democracy attempting to bring peace and emulate the culture and values of the pre-war United States, Ceasar's Legion, a group of glorified raiders adopting Imperial Rome-era aesthetics and beliefs on a mission to pillage and enslave the population of Vegas, and Mr. House, the mysterious leader of New Vegas who oversees it's casinos away from public eye. You are a courier hired to deliver a package to Vegas, but are robbed and nearly killed by a group of mercenaries, predicting your arrival.

Right off the bat you are given a seemingly vague starting objective and free choice to dash through the main story or to go on misadventures on your own accord. As you progress further on, tensions rise and you will be made to choose which faction you believe in most, or allow all sides to crumble and shoot for independence of Vegas, with it's pros and cons.

Its hard to overstate the endless customization and replayability offered by the character builds and actions you're allowed in both side quests and the main story. When so many RPGs attempt to force you into a specific playstyle or path taken, this game is a wonderful change of pace. Still one of the all-time greatest video games. One of those rare Bethesda-style games from that publisher that also stands well on its own without mods, which is a feat that's only been replicated by Oblivion and Morrowind before it and nothing since. If you're so inclined, though, mods from nexus are a must-have for this game, even just to add quality of life improvements such as sprinting. The game really does show it's age, even now, but the dialogue, writing, story, and decisions are top-notch. 

The best DLC is Dead Money -- but some people found it frustrating. It was fair and rewarding with a realistic-damage mod, so while I was one-hit, I could also fight back sometimes.

 THE GAME DOES NOT LAUNCH DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Arguably the best and most soulful zombies experience you can get in any COD. It is on par with the previous entries in terms of quality, content, and gameplay. You are absolutely in the right for buying a whole game for 1/3 of its content if that is all that interests you; there is still at least 150 hours of content in just the zombies mode. Yes, there are good fate and fortune cards (this game's gobble gums) only acquired in loot boxes, but... there are always ways to get a ton of them. 

After 9 years, I still haven't played the campaign, but a lot of people praise it, from what I've read, so that's a great plus to hear. 

Multiplayer has been a mixed bag for a long time. To start off, you are probably never going to find a good MP match on PC unless you join the discord and get a genuine group of non-cheaters. I have only played MP on PC once and it started off pretty fun, then a cheater joined after 10 or so matches. Also, you will never find anyone on beyond the weekend evening times. I'm not going to complain about meta weapons since that issue exists in pretty much every shooter game ever made. The only other gripe is the loot box system as it is one of the most wallet draining MTX practices ever created. However, the MP has so many awesome game modes that you don't see anymore, and it is a shame to see them all never be played again. Only the console versions have a small but active population, and it sucks being in my shoes (lol) because I have given up on playing Xbox MP due to the fact I am so bad at using a controller in a game like this where you have to jump up high and run along walls to stay alive.

This game has a lot of soul though, not just in zombies. From the sound effects, to all the little love notes to previous MW entries, I still enjoy playing it and it hurts my heart even more that this game will probably never see any resurgence of any kind. It already had its one and only chance with its mini resurgence with youtubers playing the zombies and recommending it in the recent years, so my hopes are very low. It doesn't help that this was the one game where the entirety of the world decided, ""nah this game shouldn't do well, we want more grounded CODs from now on""; also that the PC version had very low sales for a good while.

1850570,"Action, Adventure",False,DEATH STRANDING DIRECTOR'S CUT,"30 Mar, 2022","Absolute Cinema! I was a little late to the death stranding hype train. I had initially tried out the game on my PS5 but only got about 3 hours in before I dumped the game, but in retrospect this game needs to be approached from a different mindset than one of most games. 

The real heart of this game is, as the game puts it, making strands with those around you, and I am talking about the connections you make even outside of the story.  The genius of kojima was making players want to contribute to shared goals, be it a bridge to cross a deep river on a main road or making some zip lines to traverse the mountains better for some remote npcs or even just leaving a bike out for your fellow porters. The amount of time I personally went out of my way to get resources to help rebuild others structures or help finish up some necessary roads took a large chuck of my time in this games America. Knowing that the structures I helped build would be beneficial to my fellow porters gave me a sense of accomplishment as they would be appreciated by players. 

I cannot wait for the sequel to finally land on pcs here in the near future to continue Sam’s story and helping out my fellow porters. Keep On Keeping On. I got this on sale at 15.99 during 2025 Winter Sale.

Let me just say the first couple hours is pretty slow due to setting up the story and what not which can through people off. 

The game is a lot more than just ""being a delivery man"". It also has the stealthiness you come to expect from a Kojima game and yes you do get weapons in the game, the first 2-3 hours can make you think you'll never get one but trust me you finally get one in time, once the game picks up in just went into a ruins  that had a quite a bit of enemies  inside while doing a Main Mission.

47810,RPG,False,Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition,"26 Oct, 2010","I have been a Dragon Age fan since 2009, I have put thousands of hours into the series and I can say with confidence Dragon Age Origins is one of the greatest RPG games ever made. I cannot put into words how incredible this game is, the story, the characters, the world building and lore are so in depth and come together to create an unforgettable game with so much replay value. The ONLY downside is it is quite old and outdated and this is obvious - but that is not reason enough to skip this game. If you play this game you will fall in love with your companions, build a character from scratch, picking a unique origin and building the world around you based on your decisions and game style. with well over 50 hours worth of content, not including the DLC which help expand the already vast storyline of Dragon Age Origins. A must play if you love Baldurs Gate 3 or Skyrim, or even another amazing game made by Bioware - the Mass Effect triology! :) nice This game holds up surprisingly well considering the time it was made. Like all games in the series, it can benefit from some mod installation, mostly run speed and the fact that it crashes without a RAM patch (? weird considering the GOG version fixes this?)

Here are some aspects that stood out to me :
- Worldbuilding : Ferelden feels like a real place and every NPC and enemies are put careful through the world so that the assets put build a story in itself
- Character development : I can say that this is one of the few games where I felt like my active character choices had an impact on the actual game. You mean to say that I picked a dwarf and 50 hours in I still get interactions due to it? Cool as hell!
- Story : Gets a bit weird near the end but overall is solid. The best way i can compare it to is BG3, where act 1 and 2 are masterpieces and you kinda get burnt near the end so it feels a bit tedious. They also throw you in an almost unbeatable fight, which felt weird to me at least because I felt like a kill all machine on normal difficulty.
- Gameplay : Took a while but it clicked like magic to a point where i was missing it in the other entries. Micromanagement seems to be my type of game and making tactics was so damn fun. In my playthrough Morrigan was a glass canon support mage and while she died a lot it was still fun building her.
- Content : This game is huge and doesn't lack in side quests at all. I played like 50h and I still didn't do anything
- Voice acting : I mean its been said a lot need I go into it like others. It feels like actual interactions and I love how characters will pop in to say their thoughts and they don't necessarily allign with me

Overall a classic and I'm glad I ended up playing it. Ending might be a bit dissapointing but it doesn't mean it's bad by any means. Some of the DLC is useless but I recommend following Morrigan's story.",0.75,"Explore a stunning world, make complex moral choices, and engage in bone-crushing combat against massive and terrifying creatures.

Now it's just a fun time waster!
And the ""story"" mode ain't half bad! 
Can't really hate on the things I don't really like because it was free!
Free is good.
 For a long time it was a fun game with a lot of little flaws; great for scratching that itch to play MtG when I hadn't for about 10 years. The one thing that finally made me quit was the introduction of daily quests with very specific requirements that only work in PvP.  Even with a daily quest refresh, this often ends up requiring you to use decks in PvP that are substandard either because they don't fit the meta or you don't have enough cards unlocked to build them.

So, in short, the best way to unlock cards now often depends on already having cards unlocked. In PvP.

I understand this was probably an effort to get people to buy boosters. The game does need to make money or it gets shut down, of course. And while there are things I would pay for, boosters are not one of them. I started playing Duels [i]specifically to get away from having to pay for boosters[/i]. If Stainless wanted to get money from me there are some things they could charge for:
[list][*]Access to older blocks (i.e. ~$5-10 for a block that comes with a few boosters, then you have to unlock the rest with earned or purchased coins)
[*]Access to alternate game modes like Sealed (where you don't keep the cards), Vanguard, Commander, etc. [/list]

At any rate, it's still a better game than Hearthstone. Match making doesn't distinguish based on your card availability. So if you start new, you can be matched against people who have put down money to get extra cards.  This obviously puts you at a severe handicap unless you are willing to spend money.

Journey to cr4p and beyond.
[/h1] [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43362349/]Walking SIM curator review: 2/10[/url] A mediocre Walking Sim + Collectathon that has aged poorly since its 2017 release. Even by the standards of that era I think that it is a fairly weak effort especially when it comes to the gameplay. The physics is very bad, jumping feels like floating and also you can air jump infinitely, turning it into a bad flying sim. Quite a lot of the scenery has no collider so you can just walk through trees and even sometimes buildings. As far as I can tell there’s zero repercussions to whether or not you collect or miss the fairly arbitrarily strewn about collectibles. Indeed, I don’t think the game has an end. Unless you happen to tap the escape key, at which point you will be dropped back to Steam instantly with no prompt to confirm.

If we continue to judge the game by the standards of 2017 the graphics and level design are fine. Indeed one might even praise its single level, as it is fairly generously large, and clearly wasn’t set out by random chance but was partitioned into fairly distinct areas with different styles and some nice vistas to peer out over.  However, unless you have been playing on a potato, you will be accustomed to *far* better rendering than this game offers. And even if you don’t mind low resolution imagery, the game is beset by quite a lot of pop in. Reasonable for 2017, not so much for 2025.

In conclusion: I can overlook a lot but when the gameplay isn’t good, and the graphics offer no distraction from mediocre gameplay, why am I still here? Well, it does have Steam Cards. Probably that’s why people buy and play it still, especially given that it can be purchased on sale for half a dollar.

Maybe not a memory as amazing as the first Ori game but I had a great time with Guacamelee, so great I in fact ended up playing this Super Turbo edition later, too. It even acknowledges being a later update ironically, as at the end of an important early cutscene, the additional boss pops up asking ""missed something?""

The graphics are so stylized, colorful, and lively, and like any good metroidvania, every new ability opens up a lot of new areas and possibilities. I love how the uppercut attack works as a double jump before you find a true double jump (and for quite a while I thought there wouldn't be one).

I'm still not a big fan of the ""arenas"" where from time to time you are trapped to fight bunches of enemies, even more as this edition forces to also use the Intenso power - not like it's not fun, but I'd have liked for combat encounters to flow a bit better.

I feel it had a possibility of being much better then it is but, in order to be decent it needs to be a speed 5.  Once you learn how to play even after ten or 15 hrs, the research is like an afterthought.  As i play i like it but, i feel i am always waiting.  The resources are limited.  is it worth playing yes, but, I dont find it all that fun.  I absolutely love games with resource managment, city building, etc but, i feel this is definitely worth waiting on. Now please understand I have not fully got to the final tier.  I just lost interest because i felt waiting and waiting and waiting but not having much to do in that time leaves me just wanting to quit.  I dont feel it has enough to do to hold interest to keep you wanting to progress.  because progressing has more to do with waiting then with strategy. If you like Banished, this is a better version of Banished.

 Dead Rising 3 ruined the series by turning it into a generic ""do whatever"" open world game. Dead Rising is a time management game fundamentally, with zombies and goofy weapons added in to either aid, slow, or distract you from your objective. You had to avoid zombies, and only kill when necessary. You got better by improving your knowledge of the mall and weapons, learning tons of new things every playthrough.
DR3 on the other hand drops the time management aspect altogether and now rewards you for goofing off. It's easy from the start. You ""get better"" by choosing levels in a skill tree, becoming an unkillable god at the end. This contrasts with everything else in this game. The aesthetics, theme, and music are the most serious this series has ever been but you are actively encouraged to do the unserious stuff. Intense music will ramp up when a horde approaches you, as if it will be a stressful and dangerous battle between your survival and the time, however your weapons are designed to plow through hundreds, zombies are designed to be fodder, and the lenient time limit may as well not exist. The visuals and mechanics are completely opposed to each other. Not that it would be any better if it were synchronized. All that's left is the dopamine excretion from mindlessly killing zombies for no reason.
They continued this format into DR4 and made it even worse somehow, and DR5 leaked footage showed they learned nothing. This is where the fall of Dead Rising as a series began. Rest in peace.

Sherlock Holmes: The Devil’s Daughter follows a darker, more personal story, mixing investigation with a heavier focus on atmosphere and narrative. You still solve cases through observation and deduction, but the structure feels more linear than some of the earlier entries.

I didn’t like this one as much. It felt slower overall, and the pacing didn’t always hold my attention the way Crimes & Punishments did. While it still has solid moments and that familiar Sherlock tone, it didn’t quite capture the same sharp, satisfying detective feeling for me. [h1] Overall = 4/10[/h1]

It’s too different from the rest of the series, almost making it a parody instead of a proper Holmes’ game.

It’s fun to play as the other characters in Holmes’ universe, but it does make the game feel bitty, as do the short cases and quick pacing.  The cases have too many nonsensical time-fillers instead of good puzzles and whilst some do fit in with the style of being an amateur detective, they aren’t particularly good or challenging.  The stories are poorly written and feel rushed, jumping from the initial investigation into poorly implemented action scenes, then onto you having to make a conclusion without the necessary steps in between.  The mind-palace tool where you draw together clues to make said conclusions is clunky to use and like a lot of the game, is a case of style over substance. Solving the cases ends up needing giant leaps of logic where overlooking the smallest of details can bring you to a wrong conclusion and connecting the dots to get the right conclusions can be painful.  The London settings are good with lots of little details to make them feel like real places and the rousing music adds to the frequent action scenes, but the character models are a bit more hit and miss in their design.  The little touches and humour in the dialogue and mannerisms of Holmes and Watson are entertaining, but it’s one of the few good things about this game.

Although I would reccommend it for someone going through all of the games, there are issues I take with it. The first, and most frustrating one, is likely the direction they took this game in, and the creative choices. The decision to have a light hearted, comedy centred game set in the victorian era is baffling, the design of the world would have fit a much darker and serious story much more than what was the actual end result. The parkour in this game was slowed down by the world layout, and whilst being almost the exact same as the Unity system (one of the best parkour systems in the series) this one is the worst and least enjoyable system so far. A lot of the game felt like filler, having you complete a borough before you could continue or most of sequence 9 being somewhat meaningless in the grand scheme of things. Though it might sound like I hate this game, I do think its decent, far from my favourite of the Assassins Creed games, probably my least favourite so far, but I do like it. The more Hitman esq missions were nice, having a much more open ended structure to them, I'd love to see these return, I'm not sure if they exist past this game, however if they don't, its a damn shame. The actual artstyle of this game is phenomenal, as I said, if the tone was darker, and the world was more dense and suitable for parkour, the game would have been so much better, however we are only left with the really cool looking visuals the world portrays. I feel like the reason I didn't enjoy my time with this game as much as I should have might be because of the fact that by the end I just wanted to beat the game as it was taking me way too long. The fact that I was trying to play through all of these games made me feel like I had to beat this, and I just wanted it done with by the end. I'm thinking of doing things a little more casually for the next few games, but for now I am finished with the classic AC games.

Tropico 4 is everything you’ve ever wanted in a city-builder: sunny beaches, corrupt politicians, and the sweet satisfaction of telling your citizens exactly how to live… or not, depending on bribes.

El Presidente has never felt so powerful. Build, tax, spy, or outright manipulate your way to glory while juggling elections, riots, and random hurricanes like a true tyrant. The humor is sharp, the advisors are delightfully sarcastic, and there’s nothing quite like the joy of executing a plot twist in your favor while everyone else panics.

The sandbox is highly replayable, the scenarios are fun, and the soundtrack makes you feel like you’re genuinely running a tropical dictatorship, sombrero optional but recommended.

If you like management, satire, and ruthless political strategies disguised as city planning, Tropico 4 is a tropical paradise of chaos.

Highly recommended. Build your empire, and remember: democracy is optional. Amazing music, Relaxing, Great 360 building, Fun building, funny characters (voices). I love being el Presidente After so many years,  this game is still one of the best tropico  games. Funny, casual and in many ways based on actual  events and people.

Many RTS games have that but here is over the top. So for instance, archers are sort of useless  versus battering rams and archers are totally helpless against cavalry. For comparison, In Starcraft 2, there are also rock-paper-scissors but not the point of units being completely helpless versus some specific units  like in this game.

250400,"Action, Adventure, RPG",False,How to Survive,"29 Aug, 2014","I've spent quite a bit of time surviving on the zombie-infested islands of How to Survive, and I have to say, this game is way more fun than I expected. At first glance, it might seem like just another top-down zombie survival game, but it manages to mix action, crafting, survival mechanics, and co-op in a way that's surprisingly engaging.

The story is simple: you're stranded on a series of tropical islands after a shipwreck, and your main goal is to survive while uncovering the mysteries of the archipelago. Honestly, the plot isn't groundbreaking - it's mostly a framework of justify exploration and combat - but it works well enough. The islands feel varied, from dense forests and rocky shores to small villages and hidden caves. Each area has different zombie types, environmental hazards, and supplies, which keeps exploration from feeling repetitive.

[h2] Why I keep coming back [/h2]

Despite its flaws, this game has a charm that keeps me coming back. The mix of crafting, combat, and exploration is addictive. I loved experimenting with combinations of traps and weapons, seeing which ones were overpowered, and finding ways to make zombie hordes more manageable (or just more chaotic).

Even though the story isn't memorable, the atmosphere and tension keep the islands exciting. You never quite know what zombie variant you'll encounter next, and the feeling of finally surviving a particularly difficult island with limited supplies is incredibly satisfying.

Playing with a friend amplifies the fun even more. We'd coordinate traps, share supplies, and try crazy stunts just for laughs. The game manages to make zombie survival both tense and silly at the same time, which is a rare combination.

[h2] Combat and Gameplay [/h2]

Combat in How to Survive is fast-paced and fun, particularly with ranged weapons. Crafting bows, guns, or throwing explosives feels satisfying, especially when you use the environment strategically. Traps and improvised explosives and another layer of creativity - sometimes it's more fun to set a trap and watch zombies destroy themselves than to fight them head-on.

Melee combat is serviceable but can feel clunky at times, especially when facing large groups of zombies. Still, the game encourages creative problem-solving: running straight at zombies is often a bad idea, so using traps, ranged weapons, and the environment is not only more effective, it's more fun.

Exploration is engaging as well. Each island has hidden resources, crafting materials, and side objectives. Sometimes I would just wander around to scavenge and see what crazy combos I could make, which added hours of replayability. The game rewards curiosity - you never know what supplies or interesting zombies you'll find around the next corner.

[h2] Conclusion [/h2]

How to Survive is a solid zombie survival adventure that balances action, crafting etc. It's not a hardcore survival simulator, but it scratches the survival itch without overwhelming you. The crafting system is incredibly rewarding, combat is fun, and local co-op turns the experience into a chaotic, hilarious, and surprisingly strategic adventure

If you enjoy zombie games, crafting and experimenting with creative ways to survive, this is definitely a title worth trying. The campaign may be short, and the story forgettable, but the sheer joy of crafting weapons, setting traps, and outsmarting zombie makes it memorable. Whether you're going solo or with a friend, there's a lot of fun to be had.

It can be a bit overwhelming at times, when you have to level up multiple characters and try to scroll through the list of 100 choices for each of them again, but if you write down all the interesting things per character towards what goal you want to reach, it gets easier.

What really sticks with me about this game is the lore — North Korea rising into a global threat, the world spiraling into war… it’s fictional, sure, but with the way the real world feels these days, the premise hits a little too close for comfort.

I remember hearing about this one back in the PS3 era — pretty sure it even had that “Platinum” label — but I never gave it much attention at the time. Jump in now, and the first ten minutes already make a statement. For a game released in 2011, it’s shockingly sharp. The visuals still carry weight, and the weapon sounds? Genuinely impressive.

I played through the campaign twice to finish everything on the hardest difficulty, Guerrilla, and that’s where things go from “intense” to “good luck, soldier.” It’s a rough climb, but a fun one.

Overall, it’s a strong, memorable game. If you’re thinking about buying it, do it for the message, the world it builds, and the way it delivers its story. If I were rating it, I’d easily call it a 10 and... RIP Connor.",1.0,"The Rock Map Pack is Now Available!

The gun you are given gets dramatically overshadowed by the first ability you come across and even with upgrades it will still be not as good as just throwing stuff at people. Then there's the fact that this game has a loot system. Thankfully it is not anything drastic like getting a completely different weapon or armor since that would greatly remove the immersion the game is going for, but it still is something that you should at least slightly pay attention to make the game not shred you. This I feel distracts you from the games much more appealing story and world that it is a little annoying that it is even there but that's most likely a personal gripe than anything.

With that said though, this game is genuinely a treat. Never has a game made me actively seek out lore and parts of the facility and be happy to explore it to its fullest and there is still stuff I did not find even with typing this and 100% the game. This makes it such an immersive game that even though you are flying around controlling peoples minds and throwing stuff at enemies it feels apart of the world more than it takes you out. I feel that's hard to do especially with the gameplay this game has and it does such a good job with it. So many moments will stick out to me even way after I played this game.

The main story is honestly better than I thought when I played this on console a while back and although I think some dialogue with Jesse can be a little cringe, its hard to write dialogue for a character that sees the craziest thing happen and it doesn't just boil down to ""huh a flying tv is not something you see everyday."" Thankfully its good enough to feel a little more realistic and doesn't just sound like it came out of a marvel movie.

Caution!!!
Do not attempt to play any sort online mode without installing a mod client. If attempting to do so can result in severe security risks. Only play through private or mod client dedicated servers.

Campaign:
The game portrays the WWII setting very well with its dark and gritty atmosphere. Also, multiple missions offer eminence adrenaline rushes; either holding out or pushing against the Japanese or Germans all while the blood pumping soundtrack plays. The gameplay is classic and grounded similar to older Call of Duty titles (2003-2012), no slide maneuvers or ridiculous movement exploits. The game holds many memorable characters such as (Reznov, Private C. Miller, Dimitri, Polonsky, Roebuck, Chernov, and others). The experience truly unfolds when engaging with friends, or co-op.

Multiplayer:
Never had the desire to engage in multiplayer. Manly due to empty servers and the repetitive nature of this mode, yet this is only my personal preferences.

Zombies:
The first Call of Duty title to feature a zombies mode. Includes the four classic maps (Nacht Der Untoten, Verruct, Shi No Numa, Der Riese). Although, only containing four maps; more can be installed through mods. Truly a phenomenal experience with friends.

The liberal landslide tilt to this no matter what country you play is hilariously offensive. It's almost completely BS false nothing seems factual at all including so called historic figures. In one game I played Cornelius Vanderbilt his bio listed him as a slave owner as was supposably General & later US president Grant I don't recall ever hearing either of them slave owners or anything of the sort. US Grant was a Northern General of all things during the USA civil war. Flawed as he was its a pretty known fact he was a Northern General. In the game of the USA I played it said he was a slaver & a slave owner. At one point a someone ran away & it said he wanted them back & you must pick to return the wanted person or not. If you don't there's always an uprising by abolutionists & whigs party. Which from history & many documenties say that's completely wrong.  On top of the insane political bias the micro-management you have to do to whatever country or region you play is let alone if you grow is insane. I don't expect a game to be accurate or always factual but this is crazy. Another thing if you have a surplus to long & a thriving economy you get punished & there's uprisings if someone is broke or has terroritory you can't even try to buy it without the exact right circumstances even if you have plenty of money in the reserves of your country. I played as France & tried to give independence to colonies which at the time of the start were low on wanting independence so they rose up against me I did similar as the UK & even the Dutch same thing.

224760,Indie,False,FEZ,"1 May, 2013","FEZ starts out as a promising game with its unique perspective mechanic and charming visuals, but eventually devolves into a frustrating slog towards the end.

The goal of FEZ is to collect enough cubes to beat the game. These are acquired by platforming and solving puzzles. There are golden cubes, anti cubes, maps, and some more collectibles tied to the hardest puzzles in the game (not mentioning for spoilers).

The first half of the game mainly consists of collecting the golden cubes, and maybe some anti cubes along the way. The golden cubes start out incredibly simple, and barely require any critical thinking. I thought these would get more complex as the game progressed, but sadly that is not the case. They retain a similar amount of complexity for the entire game. Most of the challenge for these cubes comes from the platforming, very little puzzle solving is required. 

Well if the golden cubes don’t have much to offer, surely the anti cubes are where the interesting puzzles are at? Right? 

Yes and no. Only some of the anti cubes I would classify as good puzzles. I’m referring to all of the anti cubes you can solve on your first encounter (except the Clock Tower, if you know, you know). 

The reason I specified “first encounter” is due to the fact that a significant amount of the anti cubes are impossible to solve without understanding the biggest mystery FEZ has to offer. Now I’m not going to spoil what the mystery is (even though this game is over a decade old), but what I will say is that figuring it out is the best part of FEZ. The sheer euphoria you feel is incredible, and completely changes how you view the game moving forward.

Unfortunately, right after this point, this is where I really started to hate FEZ. I have two reasons why.

1. The backtracking. Like I said earlier, a lot of the anti cubes cannot be solved your first time around, so you’re intended to backtrack. While the map is very clear about which rooms contain unsolved puzzles, the problem is figuring out HOW to get back to a specific room. Basically devolves into a big game of guess and check. It doesn’t help that the movement is sluggish as well.
2. The puzzles. My problem is that too many of the puzzles tied to the big mystery of FEZ feel too similar, you repeat the same set of actions over and over again. It’s not uncommon for a puzzle to be repeated with almost no variation. There are some notable exceptions which shake up the formula, but not enough.

FEZ is a cool concept with moments of brilliance, but as a game, it’s just not fun. Incredible first impression, would love to explore it further It's fun puzzle and platform game.

308040,"Action, Casual, Indie",False,Back to Bed,"6 Aug, 2014","weird Brilliant Concept for a Puzzle game. I was not expecting to enjoy this game. I certainly liked the idea of the puzzle mechanics, which is why I bought it several years ago (probably on sale), but every time since buying it that I've looked at it and considered playing it, it didn't win my interest enough to actually open it. Well, I've just opened it due to random game selection and it turns out, I actually love it.

At first, I didn't like it at all. The ambiance is bizarre and uncomfortable, the voiceover is robotic, the creature you play as is this little four-legged dog-like animal with the face of a man... it's fucking weird. But it quickly grew on me. It really sets the tone effectively and, once you allow the really weird things to bleed into the background while you focus on your task, it creates a very interesting and intense atmosphere that I appreciate.

The things I liked about the game:
[*]It was short and sweet. It did what it came here to do and didn't artificially extend itself so much that I got tired of playing.
[*]The puzzle mechanics are simple but provide enough challenge to keep you engaged.
[*]There is no penalty for letting Bob fall off the ledge over and over. If you need a minute to look at the puzzle and consider, or set up some of the pieces in various places, you can do that without concern for if Bob is falling off the ledge or not. The pieces only reset to their starting locations if you actually let Bob get killed by one of the four hazards present in certain levels.
[*]The voiceover says a lot of weird things that were often entertaining and have, in some cases, memeified themselves in my head after hearing them so many times. (I played through 4 times on normal and once in nightmare mode, which I'll explain below)

The things I didn't like so much:
[*]Most, or maybe every time I tabbed out of the game, I tabbed back in to find it black and unresponsive, even though the audio kept going as normal. I had to force it closed via Steam and reopen it.
[*]The menu was a little janky and unresponsive sometimes. I found I had to frequently click A on my controller twice to get menu buttons to respond. Maybe they all do that intentionally. If so, why? If not, bug.
[*]On at least one level, I had a really annoying experience with the object highlights. Typically whichever item you're facing will highlight for you to grab. In this particular level, there were a fish and apple that needed to be next to each other, and when I would try to  grab the fish to move it, the apple would be difficult to get past. It ended up being easier on many occasions to simply move the apple at mach speed before moving the fish where I needed to, rather than try to fight it. This was only an annoyance on one level though and it was easily worked around.
[*]The worst offense of all, however, is that multi-step achievements must be done in one session, and must be done in a fresh session if failed before. The two that this occurred with were the one for making him die to all 4 hazards (each of these must be done in the same single session), and the Speedrunner achievement. So, I played the entire game in one go the first time I played it. It took about an hour. The Speedrunner achievement necessitates completing the first 30 levels (the span of the game on Normal mode) in 45 minutes, so I needed to do it again. I did it again. I did not get the achievement. I hadn't looked at the clock so, even though it hadn't seemed like that long, I guessed I must have gone just slightly over. I looked at the clock and did it again. No achievement even though I did it in 25 minutes. I looked at the discussion board, wondering if it was broken, only to find that this dumbass game only counts your speed from the moment you open the game or some nonsense. If you finish the game in 50 minutes, it must have in its temp files that your first attempt at level 1 was when you first played it that session and then it will not overwrite that unless you close the game and reopen it. So guess who had to close the game, reopen, and play through it a 4th time. Fortunately, by the 4th time, I was very practiced and it only took 17 minutes but it was still annoying. Granted, becoming very familiar helped with the nightmare mode levels, which are the same but require gathering keys to unlock the bedroom door before you can finish the level. Anyway, I digress. This is a terrible way to save speedrunning progress. Every time you open up level one should reset your speedrunning progress, or each level's last start time should be saved separately, and if all of them are started and finished within a 45 minute time span, it counts, even if they're out of order, or something. This is not it.
[*]And one additional achievement offense is the Elitist achievement, wherein you must open the game at 13:37. I'm not going to get into the jankiness of the achievement triggering, partially because I had no trouble getting it to trigger, but the discussion boards reveal plenty of issues with that as well. My main issues with this achievement are that it adds nothing, it reveals nothing, it achieves nothing, it has nothing to do with the game, and it requires returning - in some people's cases, for several days to retry obtaining it - after game completion. This kind of achievement is no big deal, and can be kind of funny, in big games that require dozens or hundred of hours of gameplay, because you get it by accident at some point and it's just kind of a surprise. This game is a one-sitting kind of game. If you play it in the evening, you're required to come back at a specific time - put it in your damn schedule to come back - so you can get this nothing-achievement. It's annoying and pointless. End rant.

Being Able To Run Around And Do What I Want In Between Missions, All Of The Little Secrets You Can Find Everywhere. 
And We Can't Forget About Chapter 3 ;) LOL Yea this game pretty much taught me to read steam reviews before purchase. The short version: This game is hot garbage.

Let’s start with the good:

(1) The stealth gameplay is decent.
There are a fair number of options for how you can approach missions, along with different tools and routes that allow for some variety in playstyle.

That’s it.

Now for the bad:

(1) The story is absolute trash.
And I mean SSJ-level bad. I honestly don’t know what the studio was thinking. It turns into this weird supernatural/virus/horror mashup… in a Thief game. Yeah. Bonkers. It doesn’t work at all. The characters are unrelatable and unlikeable, and the world itself feels flat and uninteresting. I could not be less invested in the story or anyone in it.

(2) The voice acting is terrible.
I didn’t realize Garrett’s longtime voice actor had been replaced, but it shows immediately. Everyone sounds completely checked out, like they just didn’t care. The writing certainly doesn’t help, but the performances make it even worse. It’s bad stacked on top of bad.

(3) The animations are rough and unfinished.
Lip-syncing is way off. Characters’ mouths move when there’s no dialogue and stop moving when there is. If you’re expecting immersion, don’t—you’ll be better off letting that expectation go early.

(4) Movement and interaction feel awkward.
Jumping is very limited, and there are constant loading interruptions mid-gameplay. For example, opening windows requires mashing the interact key multiple times or they just won’t open—and you’ll be doing this constantly. There are also tons of “walk through this narrow space to hide loading” moments, often combined with more button-mashing mechanics. It gets old fast.

(5) Tonally, the game has completely lost its identity.
It feels like a high school student who didn’t read the assignment and went off on a wild tangent about something totally unrelated. I was constantly thinking, “What the hell am I playing?”—and not in a good or intriguing way. You’ll be looting desks while monster screams echo in the background, paired with random horror “BONGS” that shake the screen or gray it out. It’s just… weird, and not in a way that benefits the game.

Overall, saying I’m disappointed would be an understatement. I cannot—and do not—recommend this to anyone, especially fans of the original series. I’m not having fun, and I’m not enjoying my time with it, which is surprising because this studio has made enjoyable titles in the past. Unfortunately, this isn’t one of them.",0.09090909090909091,"Garrett, the Master Thief, steps out of the shadows into the City.

476480,"Adventure, Massively Multiplayer",False,Heaven Forest - VR MMO,"14 Dec, 2016","Heaven Forest – VR MMO is an unusual and quietly ambitious experiment, one that doesn’t try to compete with traditional MMOs or high-budget VR worlds. Developed by Fabio Ferrara and published by Chubby Pixel, it invites players into a serene digital forest that serves more as a reflective space than a battleground or quest hub. The premise is simple but evocative: wander through a vast, dreamlike woodland setting, encounter mysterious ruins, discover glowing wildlife, and share the environment with others who happen to be exploring at the same time. Instead of missions or combat-driven progression, the game positions itself as a meditative journey, asking players to consider philosophical questions about existence, connection, and meaning. It’s a concept rarely explored in online gaming, giving the experience a distinct voice from its very first moments.

Gameplay unfolds at a gentle, unhurried pace. Movement, exploration, and quiet observation are the primary interactions, and the forest is designed to reward curiosity rather than challenge it. There are no enemies to defeat, no loot to collect, no leveling tracks to obsess over—just winding paths, hidden alcoves, small interactive objects, and scattered messages that hint at deeper themes. Whether played in VR or on a standard display, the game encourages players to immerse themselves in its ambience, taking in the sound of wind through trees, the glow of distant lanterns, or the movement of ethereal animals drifting through the environment. The inclusion of online connectivity means that other explorers occasionally appear as wandering spirits, creating a subtle sense of companionship without forcing interaction. It’s a social experience defined by presence rather than conversation.

Visually, Heaven Forest prioritizes atmosphere over realism. The landscapes are stylized, softened by mist, filtered light, and gentle color palettes that lean into natural greens, blues, and earthy tones. Trees stretch into hazy skylines, temples and stone structures peek out from overgrowth, and surreal effects remind players that this is not an ordinary forest but a symbolic realm. The graphical fidelity reflects its indie origins—textures and models may appear simple or dated compared to modern VR standards—but the overall artistic intent still comes through. Paired with calming music and subtle environmental audio, the world feels cohesive and emotionally grounded, especially when experienced through a VR headset where scale and depth enhance the feeling of drifting through a living dream.

The game’s “MMO” designation is more thematic than literal, which may surprise players expecting traditional massively multiplayer structure. While others can be encountered, there are no guilds, markets, raids, or large-scale community events. Interaction is intentionally minimal, almost anonymous, reinforcing the idea that each player is on a personal journey rather than participating in a shared pursuit. This looseness can feel refreshing to those tired of competitive or objective-heavy online spaces, but it can also leave some players wishing for more mechanical depth or structured social systems. The experience thrives when treated as a meditative multiplayer art installation, but falters when approached as a feature-rich online RPG.

Where Heaven Forest succeeds most is in offering a space rarely found in gaming—a quiet, contemplative world that values stillness, beauty, and introspection. However, these same qualities mean the game has inherent limitations. The lack of traditional gameplay loops, objectives, and progression systems may leave some players feeling directionless or disengaged. The world, while atmospheric, can feel empty at times, especially during off-hours when few other players are online. Technical limitations, simplistic visuals, and minimal interaction systems also reveal the constraints of its small-scale development. For players looking for challenge, intensity, or long-term goals, the experience may feel too slight to sustain interest.

Yet despite its imperfections, Heaven Forest remains memorable because it dares to be different. It offers a quiet refuge—something closer to a virtual nature walk, a philosophical thought piece, or a shared digital meditation space than a traditional game. For those who enjoy atmospheric exploration, peaceful VR environments, or simply wandering without expectation, it provides moments of genuine calm and wonder. It works best when approached with curiosity rather than demands, letting players determine their own pace, purpose, and emotional interpretation. Heaven Forest may not appeal to everyone, but for the right audience, it offers an experience that lingers long after the headset is removed or the screen goes dark—a reminder that sometimes the most meaningful journeys are the ones without objectives.

The combat speaks for itself. You are constantly upgrading weapons, and as you are upgrading and pushing toward max power, you genuinely feel yourself getting stronger. Unlocking new moves, styling your combos, chaining attacks, switching abilities, and absolutely demolishing enemies is insanely satisfying. Maximum aura at all times.

It’s not just one of the best puzzle games but actually one of the best games I’ve played in general. I can’t even think of a single flaw or downside to the game.

First off, the levels are brilliantly designed. The mechanics are sufficiently varied, and honestly, such diverse mechanics deserve nothing less than this amazing level design. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t eager to see the next level every time I finished one. Some levels can be a bit exhausting (I spent like an hour for two or three puzzles) but finally overcoming them brings immense pleasure. I managed to complete all puzzles on my own except star ones because some of them are so criptic or hidden. Actually, there isn’t much else to say. If you’re a fan of puzzle games, this is absolutely a mustplay. I will definitely be playing the sequel after a little time. I also highly recommend picking up Road to Gehenna. Same things I said for main game aplies for this DLC aswell. (egypt levels makes me feel like I am playing Serious Sam 3 lmao) It will challenge your capacity to operate a simple connector without suffering a minor aneurysm or your patience after staring at a laser reciever for 20 minutes. Play this if you wish to have your confidence systematically dismantled and then rebuilt by a sarcastic computer terminal.

The music is stellar and the environments gleam with a longed for nostalgia, my favorite puzzle game of all time. I've come to realize that any 3d puzzle game is but a mere 3d platformer for the less gifted folk. Why open gates when you can jump over them. Fantastic game that made me use my brain, untill i used my legs.",1.0,"The Talos Principle is a first-person puzzle game in the tradition of philosophical science fiction.

Definitely not an easy one, but if you can master the gameplay and get used to matching most of your actions to the music's rhythm, it is incredibly satisfying and fun. Speaking of music: I don't consider myself to be a huge fan of metal music in general (or at least I wasn't, before playing the game), but good LORD the soundtrack is phenomenal, full of back-to-back bangers.

My only issue with Metal Hellsinger is that it's pretty short. Even if you get stuck at a few levels, you can probably still finish the story in like 6 or 8 hours, possibly even less. Sure, horde mode can add a couple extra hours of playtime (if you're into that), but it still makes me wish the main game was a bit longer.

Either way, it's an easy 9/10 for me, and a must-try for every FPS and metal fan.

482730,"Simulation, Sports",False,Football Manager 2017,"3 Nov, 2016","Classic Best FM game!! Football Manager 2017 stands out as a deeply immersive and intricately detailed sports management simulation, offering a level of depth and realism that few games in the genre can match. From the moment you take charge of your chosen football club, whether a humble lower-division team or a global powerhouse, the game throws you into a complex web of decisions that affect every aspect of your club's success. The interface is packed with information — from player stats and training schedules to financial reports and scouting networks — demanding attention and strategic thinking at every turn.

One of Football Manager 2017’s greatest strengths lies in its expansive database, which includes tens of thousands of real-world players, staff, and teams from leagues all over the globe. This rich data set fuels the game’s simulation engine, creating authentic match outcomes and player performances that reflect real-life dynamics like form, morale, and fitness. The scouting system is particularly robust, allowing managers to search for talent tailored to their tactical approach, budget, and squad needs. Balancing transfer dealings, contract negotiations, and youth development requires patience and savvy, making each signing feel consequential.

The tactical side of the game is where Football Manager 2017 truly shines. Its match engine gives players unprecedented control over formations, playing styles, and in-game instructions. You can set team mentality, assign roles such as playmakers or target men, and tweak individual player instructions to craft a unique style of play. Watching the live match simulation unfold reveals the tangible effects of these choices, rewarding managers who study their team’s strengths and weaknesses and adapt accordingly. This depth ensures that no two seasons feel the same, as evolving tactics and opposition strategies constantly challenge your managerial skills.

Managing a football club in FM17 isn’t just about tactics and transfers, though; the game also delves deeply into off-pitch matters. Media interactions, player personalities, and board expectations add layers of realism that force you to juggle relationships alongside performance. Handling press conferences with thoughtful or diplomatic responses can influence morale and public perception, while dealing with dressing room conflicts tests your leadership. The financial management system further adds to the challenge, requiring careful budgeting to avoid debt while investing in infrastructure and player development.

While Football Manager 2017 offers immense depth, it can be overwhelming for newcomers. The sheer volume of information and menus may initially feel daunting, and progress sometimes requires a steep learning curve. However, the game provides helpful tutorials and customizable difficulty settings that ease players into the experience. Veteran fans will appreciate subtle improvements over previous iterations, including better match animations, enhanced scouting reports, and more nuanced player interactions, all of which contribute to a richer simulation.

In summary, Football Manager 2017 delivers one of the most comprehensive and authentic football management experiences available on PC. Its attention to detail, realistic simulation, and strategic complexity make it a rewarding challenge for both casual fans and hardcore enthusiasts. Whether you dream of leading an underdog club to glory or maintaining dominance at the highest level, FM17 offers the tools and freedom to craft your own legacy in the beautiful game.

232050,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",False,Eador. Masters of the Broken World,"19 Apr, 2013","Eador has a lot of interesting ideas and, on paper, the potential to be a great game. Unfortunately, it’s held back by painfully slow pacing and a serious lack of variety over time. Despite clearly taking inspiration from Heroes of Might and Magic, it ends up being far less fun to actually play. To start with the positives hero progression is genuinely well done. There are effectively twelve hero classes. The three base types mage, warrior, and scout can either stay pure at level 10 or branch into one of three subclasses, including hybrid options with their own unique abilities unlocked at levels 10 and 20. This system gives heroes a strong sense of identity and long-term progression. Exploration is another strong point. Heroes don’t just conquer provinces or fight enemy heroes; they can also explore controlled provinces, uncovering locations filled with neutral creatures and warbands. These encounters reward experience, loot, and treasure, and there’s a decent variety of creatures and both magical and non-magical items to find. Unit variety is also respectable on the surface. You can recruit many different unit types, including non-human ones through quests and racial alliances. On top of that, spells allow you to raise undead, summon demons, or create magical constructs like golems and gargoyles, which helps keep army composition interesting early on.

Unfortunately, all of this is dragged down by how slow the game is. Neutral creatures scale aggressively the farther you move from your capital, forcing you to grind hero levels, equipment, and units for a long time before you can even reach enemy heroes and they’re just as stuck doing the same thing. Progress feels gated behind excessive preparation rather than meaningful challenge. Building progression is another major issue. Structures are extremely expensive, require too many prerequisite buildings, and escalate in cost dramatically. Reaching tier-three buildings often takes over 100 turns, while top-tier buildings can take several hundred. This turns empire development into a long, tedious waiting game.

Province guards are where things really fall apart. In theory, they’re a solid idea cheap defensive units ranging from basic militia to elite forces. In practice, they’re wildly unbalanced. Both the player and the AI can recruit absurdly strong province guards for a fraction of the cost of maintaining a comparable army. By the time you reach larger maps, the remaining AI players often have massively overpowered guards protecting their capitals. Defeating them usually requires top-tier units and high-level mage guilds, which again means hundreds of turns of grinding. If you enjoy slow buildup, it somehow gets even worse. Letting the AI grow stronger just results in province guards being stacked in every single province, turning the late game into a slog of repetitive, uninteresting battles. Fighting neutrals and guards over and over is far less engaging than fighting enemy armies, and the pace becomes mind-numbing.

Variety is another major disappointment. While the AI “masters” are thematically diverse undead lords, demigods, demon rulers, dragons, and more they all play almost identically. Every master recruits the same units, uses the same spells, and relies mostly on human troops. Demon lords rarely field demons, undead masters barely summon undead, and even good-aligned masters happily use evil province guards and summon demons. Aside from the occasional “Army of Chaos,” the flavor feels entirely cosmetic. When a demon master threatens you with a demonic invasion and shows up with a human army identical to yours, it completely kills the atmosphere.

The concept is good: free-flowing parkour across the rooftops of a near-future city. There are some things which they managed to achieve which are frankly amazing for 2008. The visuals are still impressive for its age, featuring global illumination and the PhysX system in ways that put many modern titles to shame. I can’t recall another game that simulates bullets ripping through cloth quite like Mirror’s Edge does.

That said, the game has numerous issues that ultimately spoiled my playthrough. The biggest problem is how linear it is; I wish there was more freedom to use the environment creatively when tackling levels. Nearly every chapter turns into an action set piece. While I don’t mind the occasional gunfight, I would much rather focus on movement and traversal than being turned into a bullet sponge for helicopter gunners.

Unfortunately, combat is both frequent and poorly implemented. It feels clumsy and actively works against the game’s strengths. The story doesn’t help either — it’s very weak, with minimal world-building to support it. On a technical and design level, some of the lighting is far too intense; certain levels feel blindingly bright, almost like you’ve arrived at the gates of heaven. There are also practical frustrations: alt-tabbing causes the game to crash, several sections are highly repetitive, and some levels are confusing enough that I had to consult a video guide due to unintuitive design.

As you can see, I found a lot of faults with this game but if you just want a solid parkour title to check out, I'm sure you will find some enjoyment here. Some of the environments are fantastic and there's one section in particular that I will remember for a long time. In the moments where Mirror’s Edge is firing on all cylinders — free of combat, clear in its direction, and focused on movement — it’s pure bliss. Still the best parkour game",0.5,"In a city where information is heavily monitored, couriers called Runners transport sensitive data.

113020,"Action, Adventure, Casual, Indie, Strategy",False,Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine,"24 Apr, 2013","Monaco: What’s Yours Is Mine is a clever, stylish, and often delightfully chaotic heist game that turns every mission into a miniature sandbox of stealth, improvisation, and teamwork. Developed by Pocketwatch Games and published by Humble Games, it presents itself with a deceptively simple top-down blueprint aesthetic, yet beneath that minimalist exterior lies one of the most inventive cooperative stealth experiences in indie gaming. The premise is straightforward — assemble a crew of thieves, infiltrate a target location, steal valuables, and escape — but the execution embraces unpredictability, player creativity, and dynamic problem-solving in ways that make every run feel like its own little story.

The game revolves around eight playable characters, each with a unique skillset that dramatically changes how a mission unfolds. The Cleaner can knock out guards silently, the Pickpocket’s monkey companion collects loot from a safe distance, the Hacker disables electronics remotely, and the Mole can literally tunnel through walls. These abilities turn levels into intricate puzzles where multiple solutions are always possible. A carefully coordinated run might see one player disabling alarms while another sneaks through vents, but the beauty of Monaco is that plans rarely go perfectly. A mistimed step or careless noise can send guards swarming, transforming a quiet infiltration into a frenzied chase where players must improvise escape routes, dive into bushes, or sprint blindly toward the exit while alarms blare. The game embraces this chaos, allowing success through mastery or sheer panic, and both approaches can be equally fun.

Stealth in Monaco is refreshingly intuitive. Vision is restricted to what the characters can actually see, creating suspenseful blind spots as you navigate tight hallways or peer around corners. Guards patrol realistic patterns, and audio cues — footsteps, radios, alarms — become vital tools for planning your next move. The combination of line-of-sight, sound, and environmental hazards ensures that even simple rooms carry tension. When everything falls into place, the game captures the thrill of a perfectly executed heist. When it doesn’t, it leans hilariously into the pandemonium that follows. This dual nature — tension and comedy intertwined — is one of the game’s most enduring charms.

Co-op elevates the experience to a whole new level. While Monaco can technically be played solo, it is clearly designed with multiplayer in mind. Working as a coordinated team of two to four players transforms each mission into a shared puzzle where each person’s role matters. Communication becomes essential, whether you’re calling out guard movements, coordinating distractions, or rushing in to revive a teammate who got cornered. Even when runs devolve into chaos, the resulting scramble often becomes the most memorable part of the session. Few games capture the feeling of a botched heist with as much humor and energy as Monaco, and it is in these moments of frantic improvisation that the game truly shines.

The blueprint-style art direction supports the gameplay with remarkable clarity. Rooms, furniture, doors, and guards are instantly readable, even amid the chaos of alarms and pursuit. The limited color palette and dynamic lighting help keep attention where it matters without cluttering the screen. The soundtrack, composed by Austin Wintory, adds flair with its energetic, jazz-infused rhythms that swell during chase sequences and lend a theatrical flair to each caper. Though simple at first glance, Monaco’s audiovisual identity is tightly designed to reinforce the game’s fast pace and playful tone.

That said, Monaco is not without limitations. The campaign’s structure is relatively linear, and once you’ve mastered its missions, the core loop does not evolve significantly. There are no long-term progression systems, skill trees, or persistent upgrades — the appeal lies in mastering characters and perfecting heists rather than building a character over time. Players seeking narrative depth or a more traditional adventure may find the storytelling light and the campaign somewhat minimalistic. Additionally, while the game’s chaos is part of its charm, it can be frustrating when playing solo or with uncoordinated groups; some levels become disproportionately difficult without teamwork, and certain character abilities feel far more effective in co-op than on their own.

Despite these limitations, Monaco remains a standout in the co-op stealth genre. Its blend of emergent gameplay, distinct character roles, and fast-paced decision-making creates a unique rhythm that few games replicate. It thrives not on precision alone but on the unpredictable synergy that arises when players share a heist together — the whispered strategies, the sudden disasters, the daring rescues, and the breathless escapes. Whether you’re sneaking through shadows or sprinting through open hallways with guards at your heels, Monaco captures the exhilaration of a heist gone right — or gloriously wrong.

For players who enjoy cooperative games, improvisational problem-solving, or stylish stealth with a comedic edge, Monaco: What’s Yours Is Mine is an unforgettable experience. It is a game that rewards curiosity, creativity, and camaraderie, and even years after its release, it remains one of the most distinctly charming and replayable heist games on Steam.

[b] :TLDR: [/b]

Initially an interesting setup. But then it devolves into an extremely repetitive waiting simulator with almost no base progress and an unbelievably terrible UI.


[u] Pros: [/u]

- Good atmosphere

- Interesting setting that not only shows the consequences of war but also reflects your own actions within it.

- Your actions have consequences (e.g. if you loot a lot, others will do the same.)

--> That's essentially it for the advantages.


[u] Cons: [/u]

- I find the controls and UI insulting (only mouse, no WASD, no 1, 2, 3 to cycle through characters).

- Due to the game design, only one person in the group can loot, which is simply poorly designed and unrealistic, especially considering the game claims to be realistic.

- There's practically only one music track in the entire game, which is incredibly annoying and monotonous.

-/+ The atmosphere is good, but the graphics are poor, or rather, very basic for 2014.

- Very little progress in base building and incredibly tedious grinding.

- No character development.

- The characters are almost constantly sad about everything—it's war, after all... I mean.

- Battles feel clunky, and you're almost always outnumbered. There's nothing satisfying about them, since everything has to be done with the mouse.

+/- No Saves, but you leave the game. Might be ok in this setting, but frusttrates when testing things.


[b] Conclusion [/b]

I was simply bored and frustrated. I wanted to experience the ending, which was even more frustrating, disappointing, and empty. You get a few lines of text about the characters that only superficially rehash what was already known about their backstories. For example: A character dies: ""Will his family visit his grave?"" --> Wow! How profound and creative. -.- I mean, if I kill loads of people for loot and there are witnesses, it's not even mentioned in the end.

The game is just incredibly disappointing for me, and I don't understand the many positive reviews. It's probably just another hype train. I bought it on sale and was more than glad I did. This War of Mine is not a typical war game. Instead of action, it focuses on survival, moral choices, and the emotional weight of war. Every decision matters, and there are no easy answers. Managing resources, helping others, or choosing not to can change everything. It’s slow, heavy, and sometimes uncomfortable, but that’s exactly why it’s so powerful.

You stumble into a small hamlet of a town, a few houses, respite, clarity.

There are materials to break down, but how much energy can you extoll right now? Is it worth it? Luckily, there was a box of quality tinder to build a fire with and make some tea and cook some food. But your energy is still low, and supplies are dwindling. How long can you wait? Can you outlast the blizzard? Is it worth it to leave now? You can't stay there forever...
