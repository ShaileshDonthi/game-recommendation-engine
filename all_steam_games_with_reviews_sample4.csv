Pretty good addition, among the scenarios I liked the Steampunk one the most, even if it's a bit too short.

The new civilization are a really cool addition, particularly since I think Byzantium and Austria are nice to see distinct from Rome and Germany in a Civ game.

And the additional gameplay mechanics are a must for an otherwise too shallow base game. This was a good DLC.

1659150,"Action, Casual, Indie, Racing, Sports",False,SUPER 56,"11 Oct, 2023","This game is incredible! It scratches the same itch as the Wario Ware games for me. You do need to focus on this game to play it, and though there is only a single button there is a shocking amount of depth and difficulty. Very funny, often surprising. A worthwhile experience that rewards good timing and exploring various outcomes. I plan to give this another go, but too many of the games involve button mashing, and some of them are too slow to complete. The pacing is all over the place.

Edit: The menu music is annoying. And I went to the open gift bag menu option and the game soft locked?
After playing some more I find this game really tedious. Being one button really limits it and it has a regular focus on button mashing. I wish I hadn't bought it and now I feel sad. If you too want to play WarioWare without playing WarioWare, this game fantastically recreates that Game Cube era design while adding it's own fantastically weird personality to a microgame collection. I've seen better, I've seen worse. I never played Warioware or w/e before, but from what I have seen it's not quite as sluggish or loose as this is. Also it tended to have a finisher mini-game after each set and whatever the plot is to it, it's likely better than this. I'd say that this is a nice first try at it, but it needs more and overall better.

The worst part of it is when a minigame feels like some luck is required. Higher or lower for example is a stupid mini-game to have. The worst one though is the 'bar' machine or w/e. There's a reason that sort of mini-game is attached to a 'bonus' in games like Mario 3. It's because it's not meant to matter if you win or lose. But here it could be your last life.

Some of the minigames feel like they are barely functioning at times which would be a negative if it got in the way of the game itself, but usually it's just things like weird physics objects. I don't like that some of the games seem to want to pretend like score is important. So long as there are cheaters, score is never going to be important ever again. Sorry.

The game really would've benefited from more music too. It's clear and obvious they needed more.

I think I would say the weakest element though is the string that ties it all together. Whatever is going on in the story is just dumb. Amazingly I didn't skip any of it because I was hoping it would 'go somewhere'. It even has a segment that fakes you out like you're going to have to earn enough coins to bail this dude out then is like psyche, and you don't have to. As well the villain of the story isn't really necessary I guess?

It's just... meh. It doesn't feel connected and no sorta 'main game' to string it together hurts the overall experience. I played Portaboy and that's free and I'd say I like Portaboy more in spite of it having less variety because the loop is a little more enjoyable. Not so much that it's horror (though that helps) but more that there is a main game going on while you're playing the mini-games.

And lastly of the negatives this game really woke me up to why one button games aren't enjoyable. The games where you 'turn'. Like christ, even the atari had a joystick and one button. There is so much extra complexity than can come from more buttons. Not that getting creative with 'just one button' isn't a good idea to expand your mind I'm sure, but some of these mini-games suck as one button games and they almost always involve turning or mini-games that would benefit from more than one button. If the objective was to turn me off to the notion of ever making a series of one button mini-games, this game succeeded.

With all of that out of the way, I do still think overall it's fun. Most of the games are enjoyable for the price. I am a bit iffy on that 7 bucks for this, but ehn, I am going to err on the side of recommending. It i suitably fun as a nice distraction game when I should really be doing something else. And I wouldn't call the graphics bad or anything. It's more like it's just 'acceptable' more than anything. Not good or bad, but the price being low makes it enough to say that if you wanna play it and you been itching to and it's cheap for you, then why not? Don't expect the next hot thing though and definitely prep yourself for some annoyance. A collection of mini-games packed with humor. Most games only require a press or hold the spacebar in time to complete. Each level-up is accompanied by silly or absurd dialogue, Zombie John is funny. Plus, the game menu comes from a butt on the screen LOL.

The mini-games contain a wide range of genres. My favorites are:

- Doom-like FPS with a mini boss.
- Seagull to poop on people’s heads.
- Hole in the Wall.
- Phoenix Wright-like game, you can even present your underpants as evidence.
- Hedgehog running game.
- Retrieving a tennis ball against a dog.
- Train stop game and you can drop passengers into a pool.
- Falling off the edge of a car, proving the Earth is flat.

And more. What makes this collection shine are the hidden funny achievements in each mini game, I especially love the “Gone in 30 Seconds,” a nod to the Nicolas Cage classic Gone in 60 Seconds, a fantastic movie.

By default, the mini-games follow a set order, but as you progress you can play them randomly or skip. I finished the entire game in about 2.5 hours, then spent extra to unlock funny achievements. This game is a blast and well worth the time for laughs.
