351340,Belladonna,game,False,"27 Feb, 2015","Adventure, Indie","Belladonna is a gothic adventure game, twisted and dark. Take the role of a corpse girl rising from the dead in an abandoned laboratory, and unravel the mysteries concerning your own death and reanimation.","The reason I recommend this is because it gets really cheap with sales. Not as cheap as it ""should"" be given how Plug In Digital somehow missed the memo on adding regional pricing for the LATAM region, but still cheap enough for me to let slide how short and [b]generally[/b] easy this is. I did spend a considerable amount of time going in circles because there's a crucial item that's needed at the game's most open point which I had to use a guide to use becuase I confused it with a mere artistic detail in a closeup scene. It does get slightly annoying in retrospect that right after this you unlock an in-game hint system which makes one end game subquest easier (it's an item which also blends with the background, though it's not as obscure). 

There's a fair share of flavour-only hotzones, though the game does seem to cheapen out a bit in a few rooms. Most of the plot gets delivered via some very obviously placed letters from the game's background characters. Only a few of these end up impactful on their own, but they're an okay gothic epistolary tale, albeit without much in the way of twists (hell, the final note you find does hint at a final twist that doesn't really go anywhere).

It's also a bit deceiving in how it has tons of card drops for a game that's not even particularly replayable. A simple point-and-click game inspired by the Gothic, Frankenstein specifically and with a few references to the ideas of Romanticism. There is a lot of reading to do for such a short game; this doesn't bother me, but it might to someone else. So, there's a lot of story to the game but the puzzles are not very engaging.

Pros: Spooky art style and lesbians are always a win for me. The soundtrack is nice and melancholic, not much variety, but I liked it.

Cons: The gameplay and puzzles are simple and easy, and can get a bit stale after a little bit of time. Granted, this game does not take long to complete. Voice acting could be better.

I got this game on sale, so it was cheap as chips, and I would recommend getting it only on a good sale if you really want it, but it is a game I will probably forget about and not play again. Belladonna is a VERY short Indie itch/io game.

A nice little atmospheric attempt at a game.
Mostly reading notes which turns the gameplay into somewhat of a visual novel.
The ""show don't tell"" rule flies out the window with this one..

The point & click gameplay is baby level easy, it is downright primitive.
You leave the lab, walk around a few rooms and go back to the lab. That's it, that's the whole game..
-
The story is greatly inspired by Mary Shelley's famous ""Frankenstein"" book, it is obvious. It only inspired the monster part.
The writing is weak and the plot get sloppy, characters start talking like in a play, no actual person talks this way. The motivations get way too ridiculous. Bad writing.

Make an army of animated dead? Why? Lives of the dead matter? They are dead, they have no lives. WTF?
Trying to paint the husband as some kind of abusive monster, yet the wife is having an affair and is thinking of unjustly committing her husband to a mental institution so she can keep cheating? Who is the villain here? I fear it has some feminist undertones. Everyone is a monster in this story.


I can forgive short length of the game, even amateurish art and gameplay design, even the journal notes that serve as padding, but the weak story is just too much even for an Indie title.
On sale for $1 might be worth a try if you have nothing else to do.. üëçüëçüëç I like the 19-century literature vibes. [h2]Belladonna[/h2]

Has a total of [b]13[/b] trading cards. frankenstein but make it wlw. it's an easy, fast to finish, point and click game. the art style is cute. would be best to buy on sale. what a win for the wuh luh wuh community honestly... absolutely loved this game, i wish it was longer! Very short, the whole game plot is felt like the beginning of something reals... for just getting to sudden end. Game is playable and rather pleasant but don't overpay for it, buy only with a good discount. A really short, by the numbers point-and-click game with light puzzle elements, obviously inspired by the story of Frankenstein.

It's got beautiful graphics, a decent story (which is predictable, but is built and presented quite nicely with the use of notes/journals - I really liked the writing), good voice acting (at least as far as the protagonist is concerned, the umm... other one is rather bland), a fairly spooky atmosphere, and runs smoothly with no glitches or bugs, at least none that appeared during my run.

As advertised, it's really short. I took my time, even left it running while doing other things and I barely reached the 2-hour mark while having explored everything that can be explored. It's also very basic, so much so that there aren't even any settings options (beware, the game is LOUD and you will have to decrease the volume on your machine quite a bit).

There also isn't a save option, but the game does a good job returning you almost exactly to the point you left things via the autosave feature.

Storywise, the ending feels abrupt and lazy. In general, the game could have been much more than it is, a pretty basic, beautiful to look at and listen to, point-and-click game with a passable story.

The original asking price of $5 and some change feels a bit much considering the limited content, but the game is often on a huge sale (I got it for less than a dollar), so with that in mind I can easily recommend it for 1-2 hours of point-and-clicky gothic adventuring.

[b]PS:[/b] I really don't get people downvoting this because of the ""lack of puzzles"". The game does NOT advertise itself as a puzzler, so I don't know why people go into it expecting puzzles.",0.05717038585136742
543290,Void & Nothingness,game,False,"3 Dec, 2016","Sexual Content, Adventure, Indie",Void &amp; Nothingness is a short visual novel horror story set in Manhattan.,"Short story with nice music and art work, would have liked a longer story
or two or three more short novels after the first, what I'm saying is, I liked it,
it was just to short. 
Worth having in the collection, when you get it on sell. It was actually tedious to follow to for such a short novel. Overdetailed and overtalked narration does not fit the ending... Has a promise though. I preferred Carpe diem even though it was 4 times shorter. I will give a try to other titles by this developer though. It's a neutral review. [I] Void and Nothingness [/i] aroused in me rather conflicting emotions xD I'll leave it to you to decide if you'd like to experience that. 

Praises:
+The greatest feature in my opinion is art (‚ô•œâ‚ô•*) The style feels quite unique, plus it's so dynamic, visuals change so often, sometimes it's almost like watching a video. I mean how it often happens in typical visual novels--you may read for dozens of hours looking at the same sprites (rarely reflecting their emotions in their facial expressions), backgrounds are changed occasionally, still we have to look at the same image again and again. If you are lucky, you'll stumble upon a breathtaking CG and it feels like an amazing achievement. In this very short game I saw so many exciting images, several times I clicked hoping to see a more suitable for ss text but...it was gone, artist has made such an awesome job just to present their art for a second to change it with something equally beautiful. That was truly enjoyable! <3
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2834063460 
+The story is quite thought-provoking. There were totally unexpected plot-twists. Horror and sexual content tags are presented in an unusual way. In general, that was quite an atmospheric read. Some things felt familiar. I was born in a Siberian village but several years ago I moved to the capital. And the contrast is huuuuge. I don't share MC's negative thoughts and revelations but many things she mentions are close to me too in this regard.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2834063275 
Complaints:
--short. You can finish it for less than an hour.
--I think the price is too high. If I remember it right I bought it during the summer sale, I'd recommend the same, to purchase it only with a good discount.
--I wish the text was bigger :( The beginning and the end is just tiny white text somewhere lost in the huge black background. In contrast to bright and vivid main story that felt like such a flaw/loss really. I mean maybe it was something contributing to the name of the game. But anyway the text could be presented in a more convenient way :(
--My greatest complaint is SETTINGS! T_T The game lauches immediately, no main menu. That's how I start any game‚ÄîI go to the settings section first and set everything the way I prefer. Nothing like that here. :( I couldn't save. Dunno I was playing somewhere at 5am, sleep deprived greatly, maybe my brain was lagging but there was only quicksave but clicking it nothing happened. So I finished the game in one go xD Though I initially planned just to check it before going to bed :D I couldn't hide the text, H didn't work. F12 didn't work for screenshots. I think I used special programs for such games years ago, that was a serious exercise for my barely staying conscience brain to recollect where that program was on my computer XD and how it worked. It took me several attempts to upload my screenshots. 
--typos and several times there was text in brackets with (/) as if they forgot to delete some author's/editor's remarks, I dunno even what it was but it shouldn't be there for sure. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2834063127 
--The ending felt kinda...weird. O_O I mean, those final lines would be fine and all but then there was that annoying button to Restart and clicking it the game just started again, the way the button claimed xD No changes, no skipping key. I was furious. Then I kinda found out pressing randomly different keys on my keyboard that 'Space' forced the story to skip, I don't even know if the text was absolutely (un)read. Perhaps it was planned as a constant loop, that never-ending wheel of life. No idea. Because at one point without any warning the game just closed on its own xD For some second I was looking absentmindedly, half asleep/half awaken at the screen, questioning what's just happened‚Äîwas it smth intentional, some devs' genius feature or...just a bug xD But finally decided it was the perfect finale and went to bed. XD

Perhaps, I should choose a neutral review with a thumb down considering the number of '‚Äì' here xD But story-wise and visually the game is enjoyable enough. I want to believe the story may be fixed in all other aspects.

[/tr]
[/table] It's a very short game. Took me 24 minutes to finish reading it
and there is zero replay value.
All the scene changes made me confused and the ending is abrupt.

The only redeeming point is the art.

To the developer, please reconsider redoing the story again. A short (~30 minutes) kinetic novel. Needs more proofreading (there's a handful of typos, as well as two odd instances of what look like placeholder notes that were accidentally left in), but the writing has a wonderfully dreamy, poetic feel, flowing from one thought to the next, sometimes vague as to what the protagonist is actually saying out loud and what she's thinking. The art is beautiful, and the music really builds up the atmosphere.

I was all set to give this a positive review, and then a twist ending abruptly sucked everything interesting and ambiguous out of the story, leaving only a husk of tired cliche, and I just felt cheated. English visual novels have such a shortage of artfully crafted short stories like this. Fuck that ending for ruining it. I'm mixed on whether to recommend this.  I really wish there was a Neutral button.

Pro: somewhat interesting story - is it real or a dream?

Cons: 
short 
not as engaging as other VNs I've read 

[spoiler] Also, beware of ""restart"" and getting into a loop trying to see if there's more to the story.[/spoiler]
 I bought this game based on the title because I am a nihilist and have a passing interest in Steam's vast library of animu trash. This visual novel does not seem bad, especially when compared to other visual novels. It lacks some things, like an options menu, or a story that isn't kind of lame. If you like this sort of thing you will probably enjoy Void & Nothingness more than not. I guess. Interesting and very thought provoking little story here.  This is a story that you'll need to read as it has no voice acting, just music that you can turn off and on or adjust via the volume control on your speakers or headset.

This novel, even though about a call girl living in the big city.. tells a deep story that anyone older then a young teen can relate to as far as life itself.  It contains some very surprising twists and turns that will have you wondering ""what the heck?"" and make you want to keep reading until your finished.  

I read this aloud to a live audience on my YT channel, and they all seemed to enjoy it, and the average rating from them after listening to me read it was about an 8 out of 10.  

It might be a little over-priced at $3.99 USD, but it took me about an hour and a half to read it outloud.  The story was pretty good, it definitely kept my interest, but I felt like it was a little overpriced.  Because of the higher price then I'd like to see for this, I give this visual novel a 7 out of 10, knocking one point from my viewers score of 8 due to a little too high of a price tag.",0.10148491988335734
443250,Legacy of the Elder Star,game,True,"7 Jun, 2016","Action, Indie","Legacy of the Elder Star is a mouse-driven shoot 'em up for the rest of us. You are the Cosmonaut, an eternal cosmic hero who must shatter the robotic Infinite Legion and rekindle a dying star!","Readers might find this odd to mention first and foremost, but I have to start with praise for the music of Elder Star. Props to the composer for writing something that's at once epic, spacey and robotic that evokes the classic 8/16-bit legends. I'm particularly sensitive to music in video games, and this one struck the nail on the head for me.

The gameplay is through controling the protagonist as if he were a mouse cursor on the screen. Left click is the classic gun, right click is a smash attack that turns your little robot into a ball of death when you touch enemies. There are upgrades that I assume come with each successful completion of the Story Mode. 

Story Mode is five stages, and using about 12 continues (most on Stage 4), I managed to beat the game in under 30 minutes. This is good because you about six weapons to unlock, and you unlock one weapon per play-though (I am assuming). I unlocked one new gun (left click), and a new play mode (Practice Mode, i.e. choose any stage to play). 

Most of the game's worth is through replay value. The story is simple, but well done. It's not the centerpiece of the experience, that's learning how to survive. 

The enemy attacks aren't very forgiving, but they are fair. The stages ascend in difficulty at a correct rate, so that I was learning from my mistakes quickly rather than being bombarded by a million bullets from the get-go. The artwork, which emulates the Behemoth Games style cartoon work, makes it easy to distinguish bullets trying to kill you, moving enemies, and backgrounds. You should be able to recognize what kinds of attacks are coming at you to move accordingly through the deeper circles of bullet hell. 

If I have one major complaint, it's that the final boss was one of the easiest for me to defeat. I was expecting a THIS ISN'T MY FINAL FORM sort of ordeal, but nope. I'll probably give this another couple playthroughs, but I'm not likely to unlock everything. If you are looking for a quick bullet-hell game, this is it. Looks good by the the graphics and sounds but it's a very strange, awkward, clumsy and poor controled shooter. Not compatible with controllers or keyboard control because relies on a weird mouse sensibility input changed with the mouse wheel as you play the game, what? So you gotta play a shooter game using only your mouse while the keyboard input is configured by default to... take screenshots and record animated GIFs, LOL? I've just played for 5 minutes and felt some strain in my right hand, gee I ain't gonna keep playing this.

What were this game developers thinking? I don't understand it... This game plays as beautiful as it looks.  It is a well-crafted shoot-em-up whose departures from genre norms are both intuitive and refreshing.  Legacy of the Elder Star shows off all the things a modern-day shoot-em-up is capable of being. Finished the story in 30 minutes. Then I unlocked practice mode. A bit backwards, don't you think?

So here's how it works:
You are the cosmonaut, basically a herodude out to kill hordes of machine enemies who share your colour scheme. You move your mouse to move around like it was the mouse pointer, left button is a standard attack, right charges your super attack when you hit/kill things with it, both buttons at the same time unleashes your super attack. You gather points and unlock in-game achievements in the 5 different stages. 

There are things I like - the infinite continues, the mouse moving the character (as a concept), but I really don't care about hunting points and trophies when the story and gameplay is this anemic, the soundtrack just alright and the design sort of bland (with some additional issues keeping track of the hero and shots). The stage variations are of the early arcade model - they're a different background with a different set of enemies, there's no terrain features that do anything (to my recollection).

In short and my humble opinion: cool controller idea, needed some more work before being worth 7.99 Euro. I'm a casual fan of the shmup genre and this game hit just the right spot for me. There are options and modifiers to crank up the difficulty to challenge even the most skillful players, but the game remains friendly to the less skilled with continue after death options that allowed me to play through and experience all the levels at the cost of a decreased score.

Every level has a scoreboard as well as various challenges that drive you to replay and improve your score, also the soundtrack is kickin' Legacy of the Elder Star is a simple SHMUP with a very pretty art and twist in the control scheme.

The beautiful art, nice effects and good music unfortunately masks a game devoid of any character in any area. It's telling that the only characteristics of the protagonist are his name and his tacked on grin, without which he would sit right at home amongst the enemy drones. The pattern continues with art which lacks most of world building background detail and most enemies have a theme of mechanical and gray. I'd really like to see more beautiful high-resolution 2d art in games, but the resolution must be filled with detail - otherwise low-res pixel art is better when I can use my imagination subconciously to fill gaps of pixels with detail. The Music is great and fits the game very well. 

Nothing above would really matter if the game had an interesting gameplay that challenged and surprised the player. There's a serious lack of bullet patterns in this game. Fighting becomes so predictable and boring way too fast. Unfortunately bosses know only a few tricks, different phases only having more difficulty or speed added. Same applies to basic enemies. First level of most other shmups has more to see that this game. Most shmup pattern staples are just missing like bullet barrages that move at different speeds or mazes. Currently once I find where the bullets come from and find a safe spot I rarely have to move.

The replayability is really nice touch with challenges and different weapon loadouts. Unfortunately replayability won't fix these problems. Great 2-D shmup.  The artstyle isn't my thing, but it's lovingly drawn and exudes a ton of character.  Controls require only the mouse, which is cool and different for a shmup, and they're innovated upon ingeniously.  The Star Dash ability essentially requires you to angrily shake your mouse all over the screen, lol.

Really liked it.  Recommended. How many fucking screens do you have to skip through during this game? Oh, and *then* the game decides to do some loading. Couldn't do that straight away, had to waste your time counting score, giving an intro for the boss screen and pissing about with a fucking progress bar filling of your score. I get it, game developer, you don't value my time. Well I don't value your shitty game. First played this at Salt Lake Gaming Con last week.  Fell in love with it then and there. The controls and gameplay are simple but function beautfully. All in all, one of my favorite Indie game of the year.  Great Job. Makes the genre very accessible by allowing for unlimited continues and modified game speed at the cost of score. You can even boost the game speed up to make it harder and increase the score multiplier.

The varied enemy patterns from run to run makes the game more about adapting to situations rather than wrote memorization that is common in most shmups.

The controls are tight and feel good and there is a proper balance or risk reward throughout all your decisions.",0.09344514421321645

Fun for a couple runs, unfortunately unbalanced at the high end. acid trip I don't understand how this game is so incredibly niche despite it having some of the most fun gameplay and art direction I've seen in a bullet hell roguelike. The things you can pull off and the satisfaction you get from seeing a million little flowers flying off your dude gives an incredible dopamine hit. PLEASE give this game a try, it's so cool. Very hard (not surprising), but so good. This game is gorgeous, and has some really neat synergistic design concepts, but it's really absurdly hard, with no way to make it easier (you only unlock harder difficulties). I think that's a fine thing if you want to present your game as an experience that can be challenged and overcome, but it doesn't really make it accessible to outsiders in any way. Also, if you suffer from epilepsy or flashing light sensitivity, steer clear of this one.

6/10, cool art game that's also tough, not for everybody. This game is one of the most fun games I have ever played in my life!!! One of the best indie games for sure 100%!

 This game is 100% heat. The combat is really unique and the animation is crazy good Stick with this, and definitely read the ""tips"" page. It's really fun if you can understand what's happening! incredible game, hard as balls but controller left hand and mouse in right hand gives you a lot more control than either controller or m+kb alone If you thought this was a fun, trippy game you could play while high then think again.

It's a relentless ever-evolving gameplay loop. You decide in which order to tackle the onslaught of pests and monstrous creatures that plague this psychedelic hallway of hell. But whichever road you take it becomes increasingly perilous, with the final boss becoming grotesquely overpowered.

In Nidus you simultaneously control the duo Flower and Wasp. With the keyboard Flower weaves through swarms of enemies, struggling to avoid being devoured. Your mouse contrls Wasp, whose sole purpose is to protect Flower. You can choose rudimentary upgrades to either friend; go all out on one or split the power between them equally. Either way Flower and Wasp are dependant upon and empower each other -- their bond is what keeps them alive.

Yes there's a steep learning curve but once it clicks it's second nature. And what you get in return is an experience that is visually mesmerizing and brutally satisfying. Unstoppably beautiful, I feel like I'm getting better each round I try.

Summon hordes of minions, cast devastating spells, and tap into the forbidden power of the Four Domains: Death, Destruction, Corruption, and Frost. It‚Äôs not just what you‚Äôll conquer, but how you‚Äôll become the most feared Dark Mage!","A fun little game. A deckbuilder combined with one of those games where you and your enemy spawn minions from a tower that advance on each other. This game is an insane value for the price. Overall:
* Insanely fun with huge potential (for multiplayer PvP as well)

Positives:
* Tons of different playstyles, you can go aggro, you can go economy, you can go full defense and upgrade your tower cannon instead, you can go straight up spell face dmg, each of these having several more variations

* Visuals/fx can be surprisingly juicy at times

* Decent music and sound

Negatives:
* Some factions/synergies are a WIP and are insanely weak rn, being unable to pass the even the 1st lvl with their starting deck, but there's already a huge variety of working things to play with

* There are some overly complicated cards with little to no payoff (like, you have to meet 2 or 3 different hard to reach conditions to barely scratch the weakest enemy unit), they should either activate way easier or do way more than they do. For example there is a skeleton that costs a lot, has weak stats, moves slowly, but has a really weak stun/dmg effect ONLY in the middle of the map (that isn't even well defined where exactly it is)
Not to mention some frost cards, oh god

* AI art is a bit all over the place and pixel art sprites are mismatched scale-wise, but the gameplay makes up for it The pixel art is cute and charming, watching those lil guys bouncing around is a joy. The gameplay loop and the colors do well in satiating my ADHD tendencies, im locked in when im playing this. This game has so much to offer at a great price point. I enjoy the time-unit mechanic, theres always something happening to keep you engaged and if you wanna slow down you can take your time. The synergy possibilities is fun to interact with in the deck-building making the decision making enjoyable for me. The replay value is high, im always end up lying to myself when I say just one more run. A hidden gem! This is a really fun game with incredible music. There's a lot of strategy involved too, as you have to balance your time with summoning monsters and casting spells. The artwork is top notch. I love the classic monsters theme, plus summoning the grim reaper is so much fun! Love it! A really fun roguelite with tons of content.I find the endgame challenging but possible. Insanely fun game with so much content. I really don‚Äôt understand how this is only early access. I can‚Äôt wait to play more of this. There are barely any reviews for this year but every review is upwards of 40 hours playtime. Honestly that‚Äôs way more of a recommendation that tons of 30 minute playtime reviews. New to Heroes of Hammerwatch 2 this is definitely the most engaging game I‚Äôve played so far this year. Need to play more but I just wanted to do my part to help boost the positivity for this great game. Buy this. Stupidly good with so much content for like $6 Gday CardLovers,

The Dark Horde is a fantastic deckbuilder that utilises time to play out cards rather than the mana or energy as in a turn based concept. 
This unique gameplay combined with collecting gold and souls and the familiar open packs to obtain rare cards and upgrade your deck just works.
The game is in pre release BETA so I will review it fully on release but at the absurd price and the fact that the devs are releasing new content and upgrades constantly it is a no brainer purchase.
Hours of fun for 10$ 


 +Fun turn based deck builder 
+Lots of synergies
+Impactful upgrades
+Challenging 
+Very high replayability  
-Can feel RNG dependent at times
-Took me 20 hours to find out what a BigWig is  :P A charming and unique (at least to me) on the rogue-like deck building genre. Unlike most games in the genre, you don't have 'energy or stamina' in which to play your card. Here you use time or 'Time Units (TU)'. Every card has a TU cost which goes by fairly quickly - half a second if I recall correctly - and combat proceeds in real time. This leads to an interesting scenario where you have to strategically use your cards and various actions in order to win battles. It took me a bit to get used to this and I admit that I still spend a lot of time rapidly clicking on the action I want to undertake even though time is ticking down. 

The art style is cute and the pixel graphics serve it well. I will say that there are times that there are far too many minions or sprites on the screen that when you try to pause and examine them to see their statistics, it becomes clunky as they overlap over one another and you can't quite get the minion you want but it's a minor gripe. 

There is a bit of a grind but it isn't unbearable. The fun comes in working with the synergies amongst the cards and card types (domains). Sometimes you have a zombie deck that is dependent on the generation of corpses or destruction of corpses but there are cards in the corruption domain that will more readily do this for you. So you are encouraged to experiment and find new ways to play.

Most battles are short with a deck run of fifteen rounds taking about anywhere from 15 to 30 min for me at least with deck building in between each round.  So not at all time consuming and quite rewarding in the end. In the early access stage, it's got most of the content already there which is exciting and well worth-the price.

Certainly looking forward to what the full release comes out with.",0.15533279507089034

Ok, lets start by confronting problems other simmers had: it's buggy and over priced | OK, that is not true in my expirience. I have never gotten a bug from my sims 4 packs (except one where the gerbils kept dying, coming back alive and then dying) so this actually has never been true for me. I also use a really good PC, so for laptops not meant for gaming (which most people have and that's fine) might make it buggy. I find though that it only was buggy for my friends in the beginning. 2nd problem: Overpriced | I think people underestimate how LONG it takes to code, how much effort must be put in! All that time designing, so yes, it is worth about 40$ in my opinion. If a sale is coming up soon (EX: It's November and their gonna have the annual Holiday sale in December) then WAIT.

My problems: I wish there were more things to do...AND THAT MAYOR WHISKERS WOULD STOP SHOWING UP AT MY HOUSE CAUSE I CAN'T HELP BUT ADOPT HIM !! Sorry, I do wish there were more activities but other than that..no comment? Yes, there aren't many things the pets can interact with, and yes, you can't control your pet. But I kind of like that??

Overall pros: I LOVE DESIGNING THEM!! Paired with the cottage-living pack, horse pack, and the ""gerbil"" pack (sorry forgot the name) its REALLY fun!! Love how they interact with toddlers too :3. Perfect for people with or without pets. If you have pets, I have fun using the breed selector to make them, and the painting tool to add anything special they have. If you don't have pets, trust me this pack will make you REALLY want one!!

Summary: Not buggy for good computers, not overpriced because they work REALLY hard with the hours of code. I wish there were more activities. Love this paired with other packs. Perfect whether or not you have pets! Try to buy on sale, but its worth it off sale. I LOVE THIS PACK!!

Hope this helps! I'm a long-time simmer with my last account gone, this was the first pack I bought. Its a good one, but it is hard to play it after losing your beloved boi...

If you are a pet peson like me, its one of the best dlcs you can get in sims universe. Though I would ""personally"" buy this DLC when its on promotion/sale, and I think it could've been a game-base addition. I love the little dogs/cats that run around the area when playing. This mod adds a little more humanity into the Sims and is super nice to own. Riddled with bugs to the point that it's almost unplayable. I was playing the free base version of the game and enjoyed it and had almost no problems, and then I downloaded this game and suddenly nothing worked. Sims won't do what you ask and will freeze frequently. My dog got sick and I was stuck ""Waiting for a vet"" for hours until I finally loaded a previous save of the game to get out of it. Sims freeze before walking the dogs. Pets glitch into walls and under floors. I don't use any mods and have 3 human sims and 3 dog sims. I have looked up how to make the game run more smoothly in case it was my computer, but I don't believe it is because the base game worked well. I don't recommend buying this version of the game and definitely won't be buying any other Sims games in future. buy it on sale, don't be like me who bought it at full price just to realise it doesn't do much .... 

its really fun to make cats n dogs though so i would recommend to get it (WHEN IT IS ON SALE) I do recommend the DLC for the creating of your pets, but it's reaaaaally frustrating to have bought it at a great price even if it was in promotion and have my expectations blown up a bit.
I was hyped because I thought the pets would be playable like in The Sims 3, but they're not, so, if your main purpose is to play with them, you shouldn't get the DLC if it's not in an enormous discount.
However, it is fun to """"""waste"""""" time creating a pet almost identical to your own IRL and it's fun to try to figure out why is your pet unconfortable for example. There is an option to ask them what's wrong but it's only for social purposes, your pet won't reply (LOL) you but sometimes what's making them unconfortable will appear over them in a bubble, or you can figure out by watching their behaviour.
Anyway it's fun and cute and can bring you to an experience you aren't able to have IRL, so I still recommend. This pack only really shines if you like playing with cats and dogs because duh that's the entire point of the pack. There's barely any furniture your animals can interact with though and there's not much your pets can do considering you can't directly control them unlike in the sims 3 (which has the best pets gameplay of all mainline games). If you are a huge fan of small homes or buildings then the cats and dogs will just end up glitching your sims' pathing which is a huge con

Tldr: Pets are just walking mannequins that starve in this dlc i only got it to make my dog in it but you shouldnt be able to buy 4 half lifes for what shouldve been a base game feature Amazing:3",0.1611535348788638

1224030,Erra: Exordium,game,False,"9 Nov, 2023","Action, Adventure, Indie",Erra: Exordium is a 2D action adventure game in Dieselpunk setting. Explore a world based on Sumerian-Akkadian mythology. Take the role of a scientist who was able to cheat death and fight the rebellious army of mechatrons.,"I like the look, but playing through it really wasn't fun. Though you definitely get used to it, the combat is quite clunky and punishing. There's a specific parry move you kinda have to use all the time, and the timing on it feels way wrong, even after you master it. The whole game feels designed to have you replay the same sections over an over. Walk into the room - turret behind your back. Jump down a hatch, surprise enemy you can't dodge. It's often not about skill and more about nasty traps which you only know to deal with after reloading the section. It gets much easier after the first boss when game starts throwing more checkpoints, upgrades and ammo at you, but getting to that part is painful. I've literally uninstalled the game in frustration, but came back to collect a few more steam cards.

The story starts with an interesting set up, but then it's kinda formulaic and boring. very fun. loved the art and story. parrying and shooting feels good.  steamdeck ran it perfectly –î—è–∫—É—é –≤–∞–º –∑–∞ —Ç–∞–∫—É –∫–ª–∞—Å–Ω—É —Ç–∞ –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤—É –≥—Ä—É! Awesome platformer, atmospheric, but with a balanced difficulty for those of us whose reflexes aren't that good anymore haha I have been experiencing several serious bugs throughout this game, including my upgraded carbine rifle being totally non-functional; I reload it, but I press the trigger and it does absolutely nothing. EDIT: I exited the game totally, and when I reopened it, the rifle seems to work fine now. I have no explanation.
Furthermore, this game contains some very unfair difficulty spikes, and mechanics that seem poorly balanced; a major problem I have been having is that many of the jumps are near pixel-perfect to clear fully, which is a serious problem because one jump early in the game requires you to clear it without grabbing the ledge, or you take damage. At another point, the new shotgun I got as an ""upgrade"" was effectively a nerf right before a difficult combat section, as my previous gun had a much larger magazine which would have been a lifesaver.
Another flaw with this game is that the English translation needs some work.
It's a pity, because the world and atmosphere of the game are terrific, but the gameplay is very rough and unpolished. This is more of a mixed review than a negative review (Steam please add mixed reviews)
[h3] The good [/h3]
-MAAN what a bleak enviroment and atmosphere. This sense of the dread for the situation this world is in is superb. With the countless bodies you find littered everywhere and the crumbling buildings. It truelly gives the fallen empire sense as you travel throughout it (ESPECIALLY in [spoiler] the fire station [/spoiler]). WIth the minimalistic music that supports it gives it that dystopian feeling.
-The amazing art. Im a sucker for pixel art and this is some good shit. The robots look sick, the bakcgrounds are mystical and the attacks look surprisingly smooth. Very good stuff, bravo!

[h3] The OK [/h3]
-The combat is fine, nothing experimental about it (Which you don't really need). You do change what guns you have, but not the melee weapon you take at the start of the game. There are a few gripes about the combat i will address later.
-The story was confusing from what i could piece together, with the ending throwing a massive wrench in my understanding. Not to say its bad though, it was good, but my ape brain didn't compute with it.

[h3] The bad [/h3]
-The parring mechanic feels incredibly off. Not much of the parry itself, but more of the stun after it. It feels really easy to knock an enemy out of the stun, only being able to hit them twice even with the upgrade.
-The worst combos of enemies imaginable, Litterally the rhino and any of the ranged or hard hitting slow enemies is a nightmare for me, most of the time they hit me into a stunlock to death. 
-Dodging rockets, especially from turrets and the poison rocketier in the end game areas, is impossible sometimes.
-Easy to get stunlocked from turrets and especially from lasers and fire. Once you are on the pain train, there is no getting out.

One last thing that really disappointed me at the end game (Spoilers from here on)

[spoiler] When I was picturing what the final boss would look like, I took inspiration from the flying dragon (Which was cool btw) and used it in this situation. What I pictured was a duel against an amalgamation of the disseased water and multiple robots that resembled the god that the people praised for all their lives to give a ""god's punishment"" feel to it. Once you killed it, you would go to the source and blow it up.

What I didn't expect was a mining wave defence phase, filled with enemies that I had seen to death at that point, and a trial-and-error puzzle phase with a worm thing. Ending off with the realisation that it was just aliens, not some ""God's wrath"" through a plague that the priests mistakenly fed to the zigarat that created the green water. I had completely forgot about the meteor crash that had happened at the start of the game at that point. [/spoiler]

All in all, It showed great potential, but suffered in some of the gameplay departments that slightly irritated me. Even with that, im excited on what you devs cook up next! the concept is very nice, however combat mechanics and very clunky. the most extreme ridiculous fight is flying boss. you can't mellee the boss and ammo runs out in first minutes. then you have to rely on RANDOM drop from enemies, which might not happen in two cycles. very frustrating descision to make such a mechanic. Erra Exordium is a deeply flawed and fascinating experience. The theme and art direction are fantastic, the enemy variety is high, the combat is satisfying and weighty, and the story is decent although hurt somewhat by the localization to English. The level design is varied and well done, and you will constantly be seeing new assets and layouts. The developers use this in their encounter design as well, and you will see many different combinations of enemies, traps, environmental placements etc. You will also use a variety of different firearms and acquire some metroidvania-esque upgrades.

The issues stem from the particular combination of design decisions: the encounters are extremely challenging and their design varied, so you will probably die a lot. However, the game uses a checkpoint system, and checkpoints are not always in obvious places. There is no backup save or way to overwrite a checkpoint, so if you backtrack through an area there is no way to save. There are also optional areas and multiple routes in some places, although this is a double edged sword as with the checkpoint system and many, many commit drops and traps in the level design you may not realize you are now committed to progress until it is too late. The metroidvania-style upgrades are all backloaded and mostly along the critical path, so they seem superfluous. The variety in guns is welcome, but each time you pick up a new gun you replace your old one with no option to go back if you don't like the new one. There is only one boss in the game, and it's a puzzle fight; you're supposed to [spoiler]shoot the drones it releases so that they explode on the boss[/spoiler], but most players don't notice this and waste all of their ammo, leading the developers to patch the game in response. The end of the game has a huge enemy gauntlet and puzzle section instead of a boss, and while thematic it is very strange. The game is quite challenging and expects a lot of the player, but the checkpoint system combined with the branching level design with commit drops and one way traps leads to a lot of frustration.

It took me many shorter sessions to finally see the credits due to frustration, but I was regularly impressed by the level and encounter design. It was just let down a bit by the trial and error rhythm of dying and reloading, going through everything I was familiar with, getting to a new section, then dying and reloading again. If more of the commit drops were two-way and the game had reusable save stations dotted around, I think it would be a much more enjoyable experience. The game is not a metroidvania or soulslike; it is a very difficult, methodical, linear platformer. I recommend the game mostly due to the theme, visuals, and the very interesting level/encounter design, but anyone easily frustrated by repeating sections should stay away. A nice metroidvania with beautiful pixel art, cool gameplay and story. I'd love to see a sequel to this game or at the very least a dlc. Keep up the great work Devs! Cool atmosphere, great story, great music and sfx",0.06455428295880557

664250,EquiMagic - Galashow of Horses,game,False,"19 Dec, 2017","Casual, Indie, RPG, Simulation","Magnificent horses and glittering costumes. Become a star in the Galashow of horses. Unique Horseshow Simulation with breathtaking horse dressage, grandiose costumes and stage sets.","Sure, Fine i recommend it, Lol. 

Okay look, i completed the game in about three hours. Was it a good time? 
Actually yes, the game runs really well, there weren't any technical hangups. Aside from one really glaringly obvious one when it comes to the competitions, which, is the whole game. 
When you're in a show, or a competition, you cant freely move your camera, so, you cant see the number you need to press in order to complete the action. 
But honestly, that's my only gripe, this would make a great kids game. Its straight forward, you get to spend time with the horses in any way you want when you want. The money system is so lax you could probably buy the whole store by show 4. 
And you know what im pretty happy about the price too, most horse games now a days its hard enough to get them to run properly let alone you're being flat out robbed based on how little content they offer for such steep prices.
This one did great, id happily pay 10 dollars for an experience like this. I was going to recommend EquiMagic after about four hours of play, but the further I went into it the less I liked it. The overall idea is neat and probably appealing if you find stuff like Cavalia or the Lipizzaner horses interesting, but what you'll get is something more akin to the lowrider minigame from GTA: San Andreas - yes that irritating, rage-quit inducing one. You MUST get very good at ""steering"" your horse via mouse as well as timing key presses to the second if you want to finish this game.

EquiMagic is also missing features listed on the store page, namely breeding. You earn money from successful shows and can buy five separate horses with that cash, nothing else. Heck, the Shetland Pony which will be your last purchase doesn't even have a show to be used in and its sole achievement is glitchy. The ""Learning missions"" are really just a super-lacking tutorial that ends abruptly after your first show. Horse care boils down to waving your mouse over the animals in a pre-set direction and hoping it registers to ""clean"" them.

I have a feeling this was intended to be a far longer game, as upon completion you'll find lots of items in the store not assigned to anything as well as vaulting moves you'll never use. There is one show that contains vaulting for your character but the game does it for you, you don't need to own the moves like you do those of your horse. English translations get worse the farther you play, although they mostly stay readable.

Achievement hunters...I'd suggest avoiding this one. Most of them work but the Shetland Pony achievement took a couple dozen tries to register so I wasted probably two hours running the lil fuzzball around a track and repeatedly cleaning him. Stat tracking for overall cash earnings as well as show level seems to break after completing the final show for the first time, as I'm currently sitting at 137k thalers while it shows me at just under 44k.

EquiMagic *might* be worth a purchase on steep sale and if you're fine with never finishing it as it is a neat idea but the execution is pretty lacking. This feels like a cross between a bad mobile game and a just plain dated indie title with a healthy dose of rushed to release on the side. i love it Can't recommend the game in its current state. After around 2 hours a gamebreaking bug prevented me from progressing. Spent another 2 hours trying everything I could think of to fix it but nothing worked. Wrote a mail to the developer but didn't get an answer. Requested a Steam refund but - of course - it didn't go through due to over 2 hours playtime + over 2 weeks since purchase (even though most of the playtime is from trying to fix the game and it's been over 2 weeks because I waited for the answer that never came from the developers). Even though I enjoyed the bit I was able to play, I regret having wasted my money on a broken game. It's Different from any other game i've played before, though some controls are a bit odd in the show arena and training hall but overall it's fun. Few updates and this game will be even better. This is probably one of the worst games ever created.  Clunky controls, almost no music/sound design through most of the game, a tutorial that is extremely unintuitive and not to mention actually broken as the grooming minigame seems to require an item it didn't give me and just altogether a completely unpleasant experience.  The shame is that it's a solid idea that COULD have been done very well, but it's just bad.  It's just a bad game. I like this game a lot. The graphics are nice, the gameplay is fun, and the premise is unique and it makes this game very enjoyable. My only problem is the tutorial which doesn't explain a lot. There is no map so you are on your own if you want to find out a layout for this place. Also the game doesn't tell you about the scrolling or the fact you can also use the arrow keys to control your horse. Ok, so, I was borderline with this one as to whether to recommend it or not. The concept is definitely good and the horses are fairly nice-looking so far, plus I love that you can wander around your ranch and do things at your pace. I also love that the main focus of the game is actually dressage (though you are actually putting on a performance rather than doing dressage tests).
 HOWEVER, I'm not sure what language this was originally developed in, but the translation to English is pretty terrible in that majority of the items and horse breeds are spelt incorrectly. Another thing that is bugging me is that some of the descriptions of movements are completely incorrect. For example, the game describes a canter as a slow gallop, which it is not. One other major thing that is bothering me is the tack models, which are horrendously inaccurate. The Icelandic 'snaffle' bridle was missing a throatlatch and the bit was attached incorrectly so that it more resembled a bitless bridle than a bitted one ( I actually had to check the title of the bridle to see whether it was supposed to be a bit or not). The saddles are also way too large on the icelandics.
 Now this all may sound really pedantic, and it quite possibly is if you are just a casual gamer looking for a fun horse game to play, but if you have actually ridden before (like me), and know how things are supposed to look and be, then you may also be incredibly frustrated by this. Otherwise it is a decent game that for once doesn't have racing or jumping as the main focus.",0.05700937950937946

Need I say more? üòè yes it sure does fire my strike or something üëç This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you Another good test to try, I recommend getting all the dlc in a pack, you save some big money and have a lot to play with Just Love this tool a must have",0.04760692404135026

Really appreciate the GBA style based of the Gameboy Zelda games i presume. well written and the persuasion game is good too. wish there was more, or a sequel i like the protagonist quite a bit. Excellent detective game, 2-3 hours long. Great characters, setting, story, and art. 

Then I learned about the secret ending and HOLY HELL At the time of writing, this game only has 48 reviews, which is just a shame. It's a damn good adventure game with beautiful artwork, cool gameplay mechanics, engaging characters, a well-written story and a FANTASTIC soundtrack! I did encounter a couple glitches during my playthrough but it didn't marr the experience too badly! Lockheart Indigo is a cool murder-mystery noir that I would highly recommend, especially since it's free (well NOW it is, after I had already paid for it lmao)! So much style, and I love how at home a game like this would feel on an old handheld - it just really reminded me of some great 8-bit experiences from back in the day. 

Chiptune music was lovely, and I really enjoyed exploring the mansion and trying to break the resolve of the various characters you stumble across. Lovely subtle animations and artwork. I had a great time. A short game with a distinctive atmosphere. I loved playtesting it and I love it even more as a finished game. Harmless knows their strengths and plays to them well. Does it live up to the numbers of 10 suspects and 100 rooms? I couldn't tell you, I was busy having a philosophical discussion with the previous gravekeeper. If you see him again, tell him I said hi. If you've got a spare 2 bucks and like mystery, this has my rec. It's a pretty solid small story that'll keep you occupied for a night. I had a wonderful time with it. The game was short and straight to the point, which I appreciate (and wish more games were like). My only minor gripes are that I didn't care much for the robots, and I wish the color-coded doors were marked on the map. My game soft-locked in a hallway with the robots, thankfully the game saves often enough that it wasn't a big set-back. Aside from that, I 100% recommend.

 This game is fabulous. It's unique gameplay is amazingly immersive and very fun to work with. I had a lot of fun exploring this murder mystery and meeting all the well developed and interesting characters. I love the art style and I just really enjoyed playing this game. I love it to death!

 Since nobody gonna read this, I can confess that I'm stupid as Hell.
Why? Because I forgot to read the reviews!

[h1]The game no longer works no matter what you do.[/h1]
Needs a specific server which was shut down at least a year ago.
And no one gonna revive it, I'm pretty sure.

""Then why the 5.2 hours of gameplay?""
Because of cards. And still didn't worthed.
34 cents (-66% coupon) for a completely dead game which gave me back 11 cents.
23 cents loss.
Which is in this state, counts as a SCAM for me. Why is this still on Store? ‚Äé DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
I bought in December for cheap with a steam coupon from crafting a badge. Only got round to trying it out now to find it is IMPOSSIBLE to play the game ==> it requires an internet connection to a server that has been shut down. You are stuck on a screen that says 'no internet' and cannot do anything (even get to the menu). The only use of this game is to idle for 2 hours to get the trading cards. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, IT DOES NOT WORK Unplayable, servers are dead; only get if you have a coupon and want Steam trading cards. Unable to connect to the server a single time. Just run the stuff to get the steam cards so far. Just hope that the servers will be back, but it seems that the problem is massive with users since april at the very least.
So i don't have an opinion per say about the game.",-0.204614789005033

Take on the role of a brave young woman journeying into the unknown to uncover dangerous truths and locate her missing brother with her childhood friend.,"In search of her missing brother, a young woman decides to visit the last place he known to visit - a small mountain town called Okunezato.

Rating: Teen
Length: Medium (~15-25 hours, depending on reading speed)
Warnings: Major character death, graphic violence, animal death/abuse (not visually depicted or written in detail), and (spoilers for secret route) [spoiler]pseudo/step incest.[/spoiler]

Branching visual novel in ADV format. There are 5 routes, with two available from the beginning, as well as a continuation of the true route unlocked after the five routes are completed. There is also a secret route made available after the true route.

Pros:
‚ú® The main and major supporting characters are truly what makes this game. Each character is full of life and personality and you'll become quickly endeared to the characters. 
‚ú® The character and CG artwork is fantastic and the watercolour backgrounds are lovely. 
‚ú® Full voice acting and all of it is wonderful. Japanese only. 
‚ú® The core concept of the story is very interesting. 

Cons:
‚ú® The story is a little awkwardly written. They're really obvious about a LOT of the mysteries and don't leave enough room for the player to speculate, which I find is kind of detrimental to a mystery game. The romances can feel rushed and I feel like this visual novel really could have benefited from letting things be a bit more fleshed out. The fifth route and the secret routes in particular feel more like excuses to infodump the remaining mysteries of the games rather than build up the romances. 
‚ú® Spoilers for the secret route: [spoiler]The romance between MC and her brother COMPLETELY came out of nowhere and will be incredibly offputting to most people.[/spoiler]
‚ú® Feels like it was not fully adjusted for PC when ported. No buttons over the text box to click to get to the menu/log/auto. Must have keyboard shortcuts memorized to access these while playing. The game only tells you the shortcuts in the game launcher. Cannot click anywhere on screen to advance the text; must click within the text box. 		
‚ú® All characters are voiced EXCEPT the MC. 

Overall rating: 7/10
Recommendation: Wait for a sale before buying. I got the game as a recommendation from a friend but I'm disappointed that there is no lesbian route. The main route sets up an intriguing mystery, only for each individual route to completely disappoint, with the romance falling flat due to how short they are. Its only saving grace is Yuzuki‚Äîone of the best kuudere love interests I‚Äôve seen in a long time‚Äîand one of the wildest true routes I‚Äôve ever had the (dis)pleasure of reading. If you think you can predict the twist, you‚Äôre in for a weird surprise.

I‚Äôd recommend it just for the sheer rollercoaster that last route was. A bit disappointed that it‚Äôs not more talked about in the (English-speaking, at least) otome community.

The art is beautiful, especially the background scenes. The story and characters seemed intriguing, but were executed so poorly. Every route was boring and recycled, the romances were not fleshed out. I liked the idea of the character development and plot twists but they were revealed by info dumps at points where I barely cared. The secret route was disgusting. It took me a long time to chug through and finish the game. Fav guys were Yuzuki and Soa I wished their stories were written better. Technical issues are the nightmare. Every 3-5 min it force the program to stop responding. I have to save every choice because you might just get kicked out of the game any second. The story itself is not too bad, the love is just too shallow and come out of nowhere (but I am okay with it because all otome games are like that). while it's certainly not an awful game, it's also not good nor is it worth almost 40 dollars. the characters and general plot are intriguing, but the routes are short and give no time to establish any real romance. if you want something that's short and sweet, but not all that deep or well written, then this is certainly for you and not for me lol If you're a fan of mystery and suspense, 7'scarlet will absolutely captivate you. From the very beginning, this game draws you in with its eerie atmosphere and a plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The story is full of twists, and with each new route, you're slowly fed more clues, which encourages you to keep coming back for more. However, despite the intriguing hints, I still found myself stumped as I neared the route‚Äî and that's what makes this game so good. It‚Äôs the kind of mystery that challenges you, making you feel like you're right there with the characters, unraveling the secrets step by step.

What I love most about 7'scarlet is how it keeps the focus on the mystery rather than pushing a romance angle. While there are romantic elements, the heart of the game lies in solving the complex puzzle of what's really going on. This makes the game appealing even for those who aren‚Äôt particularly into romance-heavy narratives.

Each character has their own unique backstory, and you‚Äôll find yourself second-guessing everything, trying to figure out who‚Äôs telling the truth and who might be hiding something sinister. It‚Äôs a perfect game for players who enjoy a good challenge, as each play through brings new discoveries, and the suspense keeps building.

7'scarlet is a brilliant mystery game that masterfully builds tension and suspense, with a story that evolves as you dig deeper. The thrill of uncovering more with each play through, even if you can‚Äôt solve it right away, makes this game a must-play for any mystery lover. I‚Äôve just finished 7‚Äôscarlet, and I think it‚Äôs one of the most captivating otome games I‚Äôve played. This mystery-themed visual novel strikes a delicate balance between suspense and romance, set in the atmospheric, folklore-rich village of Okunezato. While it‚Äôs not without flaws, the overall experience is one I won‚Äôt forget anytime soon.

The plot revolves around Ichiko Hanamaki, who travels to Okunezato to uncover the truth behind her brother‚Äôs disappearance. Each chapter brings a mix of suspense, drama, and intriguing revelations about the village‚Äôs dark secrets. The pacing is spot-on, with every route adding new pieces to the overarching mystery.

What I appreciated most was how the game kept me guessing without feeling overwhelming. Even the true ending‚Äîwhile somewhat predictable‚Äîwas emotional and gripping. While this isn‚Äôt a lighthearted romance, if you enjoy a mix of thrilling mysteries and love stories, 7‚Äôscarlet won‚Äôt disappoint.

The love interests in 7‚Äôscarlet each brought something unique to the table, with their routes offering a mix of suspense, personal growth, and romantic moments. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of my impressions (without spoilers!):

Hino: His route feels like a warm-up for the rest of the game. While his romance leans into the classic childhood-friend trope, it‚Äôs lighthearted and amusing. His character‚Äîa mix of sporty and secretly dorky‚Äîadded a fun, endearing vibe to his story.

Isora: If you like your otome with a touch of creepiness, this is the route for you. While his story doesn‚Äôt dive deeply into the overarching mystery, it creates an unsettling atmosphere that left an impression. Isora‚Äôs personality is surprisingly complex, though I wish the game had delved more into his temper and actions rather than leaving them unexplored.

Toa: What a surprise! I started his route with low expectations, but it completely floored me. Toa‚Äôs story is easily one of the highlights of the game‚Äîfull of unexpected twists and emotional depth. His arc caught me off guard in the best way possible, making him my favourite character by far üíñ.

Sosuke: This route had me on the edge of my seat. The suspense builds beautifully, with plenty of intense moments balanced by a romance that feels genuine and well-paced. I loved how both Sosuke and Ichiko grew as characters, and his perfectionist quirks made him more relatable and fun.

Yuzuki: If you‚Äôre after a route that combines drama, action, and romance, Yuzuki‚Äôs story is the whole package. Despite its fast pace, the events never felt forced or overwhelming. His cold, aloof demeanor hides a warm and caring side, making him a compelling character both romantically and within the mystery‚Äôs context.

And what of the protagonist?

Ichiko is a bit of a mixed bag. She‚Äôs determined to find her brother, which drives the story forward, but her recklessness and naivety sometimes made me want to yell at the screen. Still, she had her moments, especially when she got adorably awkward in her romantic interactions. While she‚Äôs not the strongest otome protagonist I‚Äôve seen, she‚Äôs far from the worst‚Äîand her persistence and occasional clumsiness made her endearing enough.

And finally, the art in 7‚Äôscarlet is gorgeous, and the character designs are spot on. The backgrounds capture the eerie vibe of Okunezato perfectly, and the CGs are beautiful. The animations and cutscenes were a nice touch, but the story would‚Äôve been strong even without them.

The music really stands out, setting the tone for both the mystery and the more emotional moments. The voice acting is solid and brings the characters to life.

What I Loved:

- Gripping mystery with excellent pacing.
- Each route adds something unique to the overall story.
- Gorgeous visuals and a great soundtrack.
- Toa‚Äôs route is an absolute masterpiece!

What Could‚Äôve Been Better:

- Some routes and character actions could‚Äôve been fleshed out more.
- The secret route‚Äôs ending felt rushed and underwhelming.
- Ichiko‚Äôs naivety and recklessness could be frustrating at times.

Would I recommend 7‚Äôscarlet? 

Absolutely! If you love mysteries with romantic elements and a touch of suspense, this game is for you. It‚Äôs not perfect, but its unique setting, gripping plot, and memorable characters make it a standout in the otome genre.

Whether you pick it up on sale or at full price, 7‚Äôscarlet is an experience worth having. Just be ready for some emotional twists and turns‚Äîyou‚Äôll get attached to the story and its characters before you know it! While the romance and (most of) the characters weren't all that interesting, the plot was so intriguing that I felt compelled to keep playing. I probably would've finished the game in half the time if it hadn't crashed every fifteen minutes or so. Remember to save often!",0.13342883875752407

Classic Adventure game, played this back in the  90`s and was fun to replay. Puzzles are for the most part straightforward tho towards the end can be hard without a walkthru on certain parts. The remaster has some issues but can be navigated by reading the forum. after the update all my saved files are lost... Great game, brings back memories from when i was a young boy.
Completed game and crashed after it said ""The End"" after all the credits and the blimp going into the sunset. Maybe this is due to an emulator or virtual machine problem...? Hopefully it recorded the completion. Great Game enjoyed it. Played this many moons ago and could never finish it for some reason! A decent point&click with plenty of tongue in cheek humor and puns. Look no further than the protagonist's name. An underrated gem from the past. The controls were a little iffy, especially when scrolling on the item wheel, but if you can get through that, you'll have an enjoyable experience. Maybe someday we will see a sequel!

No matter I tried, there is no way she get almost perfect numbers in every turns, but I feel like it been cheating. Meh First of all, the opponent's hair style is hideous. 
It's about 80% waiting, and 20% actually playing.
Long gaps between draws are annoying, and a major pacing issue.

The terms ""stick"" and ""card"" show a complete lack of understanding of the game.
There is no double down, there is no split, and there is no insurance.

If the opponent has 21, it still let's you contemplate your moves even though you are doomed to lose.

This game has a long ways to go, and as it stand currently, I cannot recommend this dumpster fire joke of Blackjack. It's pretty bad. 
There are two reasons one would play this sort of game. The 21 and the boobs.
The game really fails pretty spectacularly at both.

The 21 is lackluster and your opponent hits or stays very predictably. 
The boobs lack variety and the girls face is pretty horrid.

It's only real value is as a gag gift for freind. Terrible Simple game. needs more girl choose.  lots of wiggling :) Okay, it`s a simple enought set up. you are going over to play some cards against a friend of your sister and apperantly she got a little crush on you. ( how sweet isn't that ^^) and it is a straight forward try to get the highest number but do not surpass the number 21 in value of the cards, while place a few small bets to make it more interesting.
sometimes when she smiles she can look a little creepy cause of the graphics and sometimes shes just a tease. XD

how ever there are a few things that I may think could be done something with.

Suggestions:

- Setings, I wish there was a adjustable volumbar so I could lower the music or mute it completly incase I want to listen to my own music instead. ( and the one melody going on over and over can grow tiersome)

- A saving option while in a game. ( So I could get back online and continue where I left off last time I saved)

- Redo the beting ingame, cause it's to much of a shot in the dark to bet before you get your first two cards. Maybe instead have like a small blind before the cards are dealt that both chip in 10 credits and then after you get your first two cards then you could raise that bet from the 10 you already chipped in to 20-50 credits. makes it possible to try and bluff that you got greater card's then you actually got and maybe trick her to fold or draw one to many card's herself. ( would give a more feel of in control while playing the game. and would help if you get to high cards and bluff her to get to high cards herself and get it at a draw.)

- And perhaps change the equality of cards in the hands like: She got 2 cards in her hand and it adds up to 19 and you draw and get 3-4 cards in your hand and get 19, at this point its a draw in the game but since she has less cards that adds up to the same number then she get the win because that she use less cards to get the high number. ( and the other way around ofcourse ^^)

All in all it ain't a bad game and I would recommend it to my friends. You can have lots of fun trying to unlock all of the unlockable outfits and gallery, if you got the time to play a single match in one go. I'm looking forward to see what future updates might bring and do hope more will give this game a try. 

A Fun card game with good company, do one need to say anymore? ;D EHH!! I enjoyed this game about booty and 21. The female character model's face is a little scary with some of her facial expressions, but she has a hot body which was entertaining enough for my tastes. One suggestion in a future update would be a button to quit to the desktop.",0.018920696285387006

Can you beat the rival AI? The stocks are randomly generated, so demands change up each round as well. And guess what? The shops swap their places too!","I had a fun time playing the game :)

I love how you have interesting abilities, makes it much more exciting! I like to chill as well while the AI is set to the minimum speed haha!

Can't wait to see what this game will have to offer in the future. Good luck! The game concept is interesting but 
1) it's a little too messy with multiple people with the shopping lists around all at once, gets a little overwhelming tbh
2) those people move around a lot so even after you get the item, they have moved to the other floor and you have to go find them again lol, a little annoying ngl
3) the AI obviously knows where all the stuff are so it's like impossible to try and compete with it at all really
4) each item for each person can only be fulfilled once by you or the bot so it's kinda frustrating that you scramble to find the item only to return and see that the bot had already gave it to the person lol
5) not sure if it's a bug but when you and the guy with the shopping list is on the escalator, you can't see their list clearly
6) I feel it would be a better game if it has a career/story mode where you have to find a list of items within a very short amount of time like maybe 1-2mins to complete the level or being able to compete against friends/other people or like some shopping simulator with different levels/story 

Hope my honest feedback will help develop the game! (:",0.08450854700854703

A weird plot with lots of NPCs and monsters to slay? Then, this is the game you are looking for. Beware! Do not get fooled by the nice and happy graphics, it is not as easy as you may think.","bought this game because i missed the free key from your 9gag post, lol

i play this game on 1680x1050 monitor (i know, it's not your usual monitor resolution). if i play on fullscreen, the screen will be cropped, left and right part is missing. so i played on windowed mode, smaller resolution. it would be great if the game support not only 16:9 scale but also other scale like 16:10 or maybe older 4:3 monitor.

next, it would be better if we can use ESC key as ""back"" button instead of clicking X button on the screen

character movement is responsive, no input lag or i just don't feel it at all

slow and curved ranged attack insist you to calculate it's projectile movement. these increased the difficulty and become more challenging for people who usually plays game, but i think it would be a little bit too difficult for casual gamer. well it depends on your market target.

PC Spec: Xeon E3-1270 V2 (IvyBridge), RX 480 8GB, 16GB RAM. using epic setting.
about >75fps on tutorial area, and drops about 60 on the area after that. >180fps on trader area.

i think this game have a great prospect in the future. i love the low-poly models and the world design.
still haven't played for long because I have to get back to my work (will try to play again later)

wish you all the best in developing this game, cheers!
*sorry for my bad english It's not a bad premise but attacking using the controller didn't work and the maze is incredibly frustrating: insta kill traps and a requirement that you start from the beginning each time. It might get better through early access.

458960,Winning Putt: Golf Online,game,False,"25 Oct, 2016","Free To Play, Massively Multiplayer, Simulation, Sports","Join the ultimate free-to-play PC golf experience. Perfect your golf game across ten beautiful courses. Play with friends worldwide anytime, anywhere.","the ground is superb white Haha nah this game can fuck right off hey. Absolutely stupid piece of crap. Graphics are great, swing meter is pretty good (resolution of swing is too low). The courses are are very nice looking and other players are great so far. Ive played this about a month now have a level 19 power player and a 20 accuracy player. Here is the whats not so great. Accuracy players have it way easier the punishment for running out of mentality as a power player is so bad that your either buying tons of mentality drinks or your round is done the meter moves like lightning. The physics need alot of work yet. Sometimes the wind seems random as to if it will effect the ball flight or not. Bunker shots are a joke most of the time. You can wing a full meter and go 2 ft even with a straight swing. The greens are definately more along the lines of putt putt vs golf. There are holes in middle of hills down in pits in the green and some greens the shot can have 3 breaks and a downhill so bad a full swing meter wont get you there. I really like this game and I want it to be the next big online golf game but its not there yet. I would like to see them really study the courses and fix geometry and physics issues like hole 10 or 11 on Seven Angels if you land just at the top of the hill before the first water trap all the shots go straight down into the water reguardless of club. I had to pitch backwards and redo the shot. I would like to see better servers as the lag effects the swing meter as well as the group play we see alot of disconnects and game pauses from players being dropped. I have done my part to support the dev I spent roughly 250$ on this game so far seeing if the premium stuff made it better. To be honest it almost makes it playable the clubs are able to go longer distances with better accuracy if you dont hit the perfect shot. Nice game! The golf aspects of this game are mediocre at best. The game takes very little skill, and how well you do is entirely based on your stats.

However, where this game really fails is that there is simply no feeling of character progression. In other words, in a game that is entirely based on stats, the gains in stats when you level up are hardly noticeable. Like you would expect after gaining a few levels to be able to go back to a course that was challenging before and now do much better. Unfortunately, that simply is not the case.

Plus there really doesn't seem to be any gear or clubs to ‚Äúsave up‚Äù gold for. There was like 1 shirt in the apparel shop and then some clubs that seemed like a downgrade from the clubs that you got for free from quests.


Edit: To explain my point more.  When you start the game at level1, it is impossible to reach the green in 2 shots on a par4 even on the easiest courses.  Pretty much every par4 hole is:

Shot1: hit the crap out of the ball with the Driver
Shot2: hit the crap out of the ball with the 3W
Shot3: hit the ball onto the green with a wedge
Shot4: 1 putt for par

What you would expect is that you could come back in 15 levels, and now easily be able to make it to the green in 2 swings on the easiest courses.  However instead, the only change is that now your pitch on shot3 is 40 yards instead of 70 yards.

Also, I don't like the fact that if you are in the rough (or worse the sand), there is a totally luck based chance that you next shot goes off in a random direction even if you hit it perfectly (get a ‚Äúnice‚Äù).  Why not make it skill based? Gay tells me to install direct x 9.0...
but i have all direct x up to 11.
shitty game dont download it ...
not worth bullshit

 Great game This game is fun, but the controls seem to be more suited for someone with a controller Much better shaft gripping and ball whacking experience than offered from any EA golf game! This game is great. It's simple and doesn't require you to be a golf expert in order to play.

Answer the clues, arrange the pieces and discover the words.","By far the most wild and nonsensical crossword hints we've ever seen. The only way I can imagine these were made by hand is if the designer didn't speak English and tried to translate them. Half the puzzles are just frustratingly bad and leave you guessing random words until something fits. Zup! Z gives you 512 achievements in less than 90 minutes of gameplay, but for some reason this enjoyable word game with double the content is ""too small"" to have the 100% achievements count towards your total. 

Valve is fickle, its judgement is irrational and harsh. 

Still worth playing. Challenging in normal mode [b]wordland 3[/b] is exactly the same as [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dohi64/recommended/1599690]the first game[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dohi64/recommended/1640760]the second[/url], essentially another level pack, so I posted pretty much the same review for it.

it's still a great word game/crossword/tetris hybrid. there are various shapes with letters on a grid and they have to be arranged to form all the words described on the bottom. no diagonals, only left to right or downward, but they don't all have to be connected to each other. in fact, the game accepts layouts that wouldn't fly in a real crossword (e.g. 'sir' horizontally, 'pure' above it vertically, so it's technically 'purei' but it's fine here).

[b]100 levels[/b] unlocked one by one, the [b]3 difficulty levels[/b] control the amount of revealed letters (more on easy, only the first letter on normal, none on hard). there's no indication of any of this in the game, and what will drive achievement people up the wall is playing on hard doesn't unlock easy and normal achievements, so 3 full playthroughs for them, while the rest of us can enjoy playing however we please.

[b]controls are very convenient[/b], left click to pick a piece up, mouse wheel to rotate in either direction, another left click to place. my biggest gripe with the game was the size of the board, lots of tedium when the word was one letter too long and the entire thing had to be moved a tile to the left piece by piece. plenty of space on the screen, not sure why only a small area was used if it's not a lazy mobile port, but the current size is mostly good enough.

the same [b]excellent music and background images[/b] with only a few new pictures. some of them are animated, but a surprising amount is too dark and might interfere with the grid and pieces. they change after every restart or new level, and can be changed manually, and also locked so they stay the same all the way. [b]a gallery of them could be a great reward for completing the game.[/b]

settings-wise all the neccessities are present, separate volume settings, windowed mode with a couple resolution options (there could be a few more), and level selection is also a thing. these are all accessible from the main menu and while playing.

[b]difficulty is all over the place[/b], though it obviously also depends on your vocabulary. still, it's really pleasant overall, and [b]the price to become a citizen of wordland yet again is reasonable[/b]. can't say I approve of [b]releasing not one but two identical sequels within a short time[/b] though.

The girl will look for her and clues of her. What will the girl find in end of the story?,"Yearnings stylistic choice and sound design is great, but as other reviews point out, its extremely slow. There is no sprint and you have to backtrack many times, even more so if you miss something, and that becomes very tedious.

[b] Horror/Surrealist centered Curator: [url=store.steampowered.com/curator/43071910/] KuriKuration[/url] [/b] I know that a lot of reviews here mentioned the weird English translation and such but for me it doesn't really make the gaming experience worse. The game play is pretty good. Got stuck at how to get to the place to put the flowers for like an hour and eventually got through. The game is not difficult at all but the sound atmosphere is great! Highly recommend to play with a gaming headset to enhance the experience even more. Yes, it's 2D. But it can give you a scare all the same. I really loved the game! The atmosphere was great and I really liked the art style, felt very unique. The lantern's radius also created a lot of suspense as I was exploring and the background sounds and music really added to the suspense and creepy factor in the various locations. I loved theorizing about the story and what everything meant as I went (All of my theories were wrong by the end though haha). 

The English translations could have had better grammar but I still found it easy to understand what everything was trying to say so this wasn't a big deal to me. Using the stairs in the storehouse however can be a bit tough, and it took me a few tries moving back and forth pressing and holding z to get it to work but it eventually did, if anything that would be my only real gripe.

Overall this was a great and very enjoyable experience and I highly recommend it! Good news first, it works out quite well for a horror game.  It has the good old Silent Hill feel of enviroments that are both normal and surreal.  I found the mystery of the plot nice (though I kinda guess the answer early), and more than once it was somewhat fairy tale like.  And the art I quite nice too.

Bad news, I really wish I could run.  Rin's walk is painfuly slow, and you will get to feel that as you explore.  And while the atmosphere is quite good, broken english in dialogue and descriptions tended to make me chuckle a bit more than once.

This game is still worth playing despite this.  The atmosphere is great for a horror game and the story is nice to experence.  While it does feel like horror games are dime a dozen, this game is well worth your time. If you liked Detention, I think you'll like Yearning. There are some definite similarities between the two. The only thing I don't like is that once you make it to a certain point in the game, it's very easy to lose a bunch of progress. I wish they had made that section a little easier to progress through but other than that, it's definitely got great atmosphere and it's a fun little game. I enjoyed what I've played of it so far.

465900,Dark Tales: Edgar Allan Poe's The Gold Bug Collector's Edition,game,False,"9 Jun, 2016","Adventure, Casual",Dupin needs your help!,"[h1]Too short, and too simple for most of us adults, but it might be fine for kids.[/h1]

For such a lame HOG to bear the name of Edgar Allan Poe is a travesty. There is hardly any complexity that you might assume would come with it - the first part of the game has no backtracking, there are no collectables, no achievements, no card drops ergo no badges, and the puzzles are laughable.

So there are a few hidden scenes (messes with a list of what to find) and a few deductive reasoning scenes (where you follow a domino effect to eventually end up with one item, but everything you find, you use to get that item). But some of these... whew! One that stood out for me as ridiculous was somehow pulling up a boat buried in a lake in a cave, and thoroughly searching it, so as to open an age-old chest to get... a pickaxe! What in tarnation!

There are a few puzzles that might give you cause to stop and think but let me just add that my total play time includes going away from keyboard to get dinner and look after our pet bird, so I'm guessing the average hogger will finish in around the same time as me.

However I didn't even bother with the bonus chapter, such was my distaste for the whole experience.


I have another of these 'Edgar Allan Poe' titles in my backlog... I'm really not looking forward to it.

Also, be ready for your game to crash a few times at random due to runtime errors. Crashed three times but I did manage to complete the main game. Story is average, locks are rather nonsensical and hitboxes are small with some of the HOG items being named oddly (ex. ""cone"" for a pine cone.) Voice acting is the highlight, but because it's so badly recorded it's funny. A few of the voiced characters sound like they're locked in basements. The voice actors themselves did 110% acting, to the point that I laughed multiple times and grinned a lot listening to them. I would fully recommend the game if not for the crashing issue. The plot about treasure hunt isn't nearly as interesting as the series' usual forray into murders, but the gameplay makes up for that.

8/10 Good puzzles, not so hard that you have to ask for hints all of the time.  Fun! This series seems to follow the plots of Edgar Allen Poe‚Äôs stories. Of course, with you and a Detective involved. In this one you have to save/protect a man who believes he has uncovered the location of Captain Kidd‚Äôs treasure.

HO scenes are fun, minigames challenging, and the plot engaging. Recommend in the bundle, just for ease of purchase.
 Pretty average and it stopped working three times displaying ""runtime error"" I have always been a fan of Edgar Allan Poe Stories, It is very difficult at this time with the pandemic to take your mind of the worries of each day. I am 49 years old and take comfort that there is games that have a story and puzzles and easy to hard difficulties. For those adult gamers it is worth paying for some break from reality A reluctant thumbs-up. It was too short for the price (8.99 US). But overall a decent game. The mini-games were more varied and better than I normally find with Artifax Mundi. I am not one that cares about story too much, but this story was a bit below average, I would say. I still rate this a bit higher than many of the Artifax Mundi games, though. I just love the series and what they made with E.A.Poes Stories.
This one is rather short and the puzzles are quite easy, but artwork and story are really good.
The only problem for me is, that it really crashes a lot (but I never lost progress).
I would recommend grabbing it on sale (because of the crashes and its shortness). Fantastic, fun game. 10/10
Definitely recommend this one.

- Love the continuous puzzles all the way through. 
- Great mix of puzzle styles from easy to hard.
- Gorgeous old world Kinkade style graphics. 
- Nice music & voice acting.
- You get a dog!

1232010,Radical Rabbit Stew,game,False,"16 Jul, 2020","Action, Adventure, Indie","Radical Rabbit Stew is a hare-raising action-arcade game, featuring fast-paced whack-a-rabbit gameplay, scintillating puzzles, super-sized boss fights, juicy pixel graphics and a sizzling soundtrack, perfect for new players and 16-bit retro fans alike!","There's a lot of content for the 2 euro i paid for this.
The gameplay is pretty solid, the puzzles are engaging, the story is pretty well written, the abilities you get are great, and the bunnies must be stewed. The boss fights are very frantic and they test your agility and quick thinking, but they are never unfair.
It's a very good puzzle game, and I saw it has multiplayer, which I haven't played :o fun. The game is fun and the puzzles are good enough but the stock and memey sound effects are incredibly annoying if you can get past that it's a fun game to kill some time This game is pure old school brilliance. It says a lot that I absolutely loved it because I tend to hate when video games make me wait, mechanics like waiting for moving platforms to return are really annoying, and Radical Rabbit Stew's main concept is all about waiting and timing: You start with only a simple wooden spoon, and you must hit rabbits into pots as they walk around to win each level. Yet, it is a joy to interact with these simple mechanics, it never takes too long for the rabbits to line up or for you to have an AHA moment and hit them in a way that mostly automates the rest of the path as it interacts with all sorts of mechanics on the way to its final, stewey destination.

The controls are tight and the game gives you plenty of space to get used with the mechanics you have before introducing new ones, there are new enemy types and gimmicks almost every other couple of levels but the level gimmicks never feel TOO gimmicky, like you're playing a completely different game or a mini-game, oh no, the gimmicks are all properly intergrated with the game and all gel together with the main objective of sending rabbits into pots or breaking apart blocks that stop you from putting them into pots. In that way, it feels like a more puzzly, timing based approach to Bomberman, though there are both levels that favor action and speed while some are purely puzzles, the fact they both work so well is incredible, there is not a single bad or annoying level in the whole game. And it would be a giant mistake to not mention each world has a mini-boss battle and an overall area boss, all super fun to fight, all different enough to be separately enjoyable, the main game might clock in at just about 3 hours long, but it is a creativity filled 3 hours long that wraps up when the ideas of the devs probably wrapped up as well, which is a good thing, more developers could learn from that.

Surprisingly, in spite of being based on old school games, with the music and the graphics recalling the greats from the SNES/PC-Engine era, this one is really approachable in terms of difficulty, there is a hardcore mode for a more old school challenge, but more casual gamers shouldn't skip this one either, if you have any interest in simple, arcade-like gameplay loops with no frills that simply try to be fun from the word GO, you own it to yourself to try out Radical Rabbit Stew. Worth it for the soundtrack alone. A friend of mine said it's a good game, slept on possibly. This game needs way way more attention Still haven't figured out how this is supposed to help me cook stew, I wasn't sure what to expect from this game mechanically, but it turned out to be a level-based top-down action game where your goal is to whack rabbits and send them flying into pots using bouncers on the walls and other stuff. You get some new abilities throughout that are used in some mild puzzle aspects. I wish there was a little more of that, but it's not really what the game is going for, so whatever. It's a solid little game that's fast-paced and doesn't waste your time, and the bombastic animation and music get you pumped. Some of the levels get kinda irritating in certain spots, but nothing too bad. I finished it in about 4 hours, and that's with exploring around a little to find the optional collectibles. It would probably be pretty fun to speedrun if you're into that. There's also a level editor included that seems pretty easy to use. Thumbs up. Excellent game however waaay to short unless you subscribe to player made levels from the workshop which is very limited. Can we get a Radical Rabbit Stew 2 or a DLC? I recommend purchasing this on sale. The levels are creative and the mechanics are a ton of fun!",0.08069548389463643

So... a [b]VR[/b] game for... [b]$0.99[/b]? Huh. Based on popular b-movie series with [b]Ian Ziering[/b] too. There must be a catch. Right? I mean, a good [b]VR[/b] game can't cost less than a buck. It just can't. Sure, it's not like the original [b]Sharknado VR[/b] was a good game to begin with. Exactly the opposite. It's was a mess. Feel free to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/letande/recommended/925090/ ]check out my detailed review[/url] if you want details, but long story short ‚Äì it was a very basic shooting gallery, in which you were supposed to shoot sharks, while avoiding (or destroying) everything else that used to fly at you. Doesn't sound that bad, but the problem is ‚Äì it was [i]ridiculously[/i] cheap and half-broken game. It was all about half-broken controls and terrible physics, thanks to which it was hard to even tell what did just hit you. It was pretty short too and only had four levels. So, da f*ck is this ‚Äúarcade edition‚Äù and why is it so cheap?
 
Well, the thing is... it's a scam. Simple like that. ‚Äú[b]Arcade Edition[/b]‚Äù of [b]Sharknado VR[/b] is just a demo. There's only one level here ([b]LA[/b], the first level from the full game), all the weapons are unlocked since very beginning and there's no way to upgrade them. It looks like our usual demo, it feels like our usual demo and, well, it [i]is[/i] our usual demo. There's literally nothing else to say. It's just a demo of a very, [i]very[/i] bad game. Nothing else here and even that cheesy intro wasn't included. So, here's the question ‚Äì why? No, seriously, why? It's not like I'm angry about wasting a buck (pretty sure I can afford that, lol), it's just... When somebody tries to scam you for a single buck? Guess, it says something about 'em. Shame on you, [b]Autumn VR[/b]. Then again, some people just don't care about their bad reputation. One way or another, don't you even think paying for this. Even though it costs only one buck, it still doesn't worth it. Dixi. chainsaw op i dont have a vr headset There is only one level and it lasts for 5 minutes. The original version of the game has multiple levels and I assumed this was an arcade-ified version of that game but it's just one level and you start with all the weapons. Not even worth the $1. Just get the original version on sale instead. If you go into ‚ÄòSharknado VR (Arcade Edition)‚Äô looking for a game that is just as terribly made as the movies you should get what you are expecting. While the only difference I can see between the original game and this new ‚ÄúArcade Edition‚Äù is all the weapons being unlocked, the rest seems like the same game. It‚Äôs an action shooter that sees you shooting sharks that are flying towards you from a tornado with a range of weapons, most of which run out of ammo pretty quickly. It‚Äôs windy, post-apocalyptic and the graphics are OK at best. Gameplay-wise the game will leave you questioning ‚ÄòIs this game bad because it is supposed to be a terrible game on a shoestring budget just like the movies? Or is it bad because it was made badly? ‚Äò For just ¬£0.79 it‚Äôs worth a look, but the answer to that question is Yes, in both ways.

The combat is great, the sprites are amazing, and the story is pretty good. I loved the voice acting (the cast is quite stacked as well, surprisingly), and the characters were pretty interesting (they still have their issues, but I cut the devs some slack on this considering how well-done most of the rest of the game was). 

Also Eve is broken asf :p. 

The customization in this game is actually a lot more intense than I was expecting. You have rings, elixirs, weapons, runes, bonds, classes, promotions...there's a lot to get to and some you won't get to in a single playthrough. I don't think I even managed to read what every single ring did by the time I finished the game.

 A step-up from the original; lots of unit customisation evokes a game that promotes gameplay diversity and replay-ability. Overall good game. Rush through the game for the story and will do another playthrough.

Story is ok. Just ok.

Cant stand the MC. Too much whining. TLDR: Give them your money already.
If you like turn-based tactics games, more specifically Fire Emblem, I recommend this! Character build customization is excellent and interesting. It's very entertaining to experiment with different classes, weapons, and rings. This is a game that welcomes and challenges you to break the game. The art and voice acting are exceptional, especially considering this game is only 25 dollars! If you like retro graphics, this game is a no-brainer. It has a solid amount of content and plenty of difficulties and campaign modifiers for additional playthroughs.  This was a massive improvement from the first game, and I did not expect it to be this good. They also did a great job with the main cast. I find all the central characters to be likable and I enjoyed most scenes they were present in.

This game was great, but I will leave some notes on things I was less fond of. None of these things ruined my experience, and I leave these here only for constructive criticism:
- Deity difficulty was a lot easier than I expected. I try not to play games on the hardest difficulty on the first playthrough, but with this game I should have.
- I think the class system needed a tutorial around the time you get your first ingot. I didn't realize you kept your tier 1 skills when you promote. I couldn't find a way to change your tier 1 class after promoting, so I really nerfed some of my characters this way. I think with a short explanation this would not be a problem at all. In fact I think it's a great system.
- I think certain characters might break the game too fast. While it is really fun to use those characters, their pure strength also removed a lot of strategy and planning from maps. Notably, though this is a criticism, I loved that the main characters were actually good.

This game was fantastic. Thank you so much for making. I'm looking forward to more. Did i want a immersive story. check. voice acting characters. check. captivating narrative with simple yet fun combat. check. disclaimer, deity, random level ups, turn timers on for half of the game (i had them off at first and turned them on)

almost finished up with the game at this point, i'm not sure if i'd recommend it (there's no mixed option) it's close for sure. The concept and the first ~15-20 chapters are actually pretty good. I really liked the abilities and the super deep customization in the onset, having mana and unique personals that are really impactful made each character feel different gameplay-wise. I spent legitimate hours trying to plan out how i wanted to build certain characters and what rings to equip them with. awesome stuff there.

i'd say it falls apart pretty quickly in that chapter 20+ area, once you get the advanced classes (25+) it's pretty clear some classes are just ridiculous compared to others, and mastery based units are SIGNIFICANTLY stronger than others for the most part. Only exception there is eve. The entire warrior/vanguard line is borderline useless and it's really discouraging seeing such large gaps between characters, you're probably better off running many multiples of the same class rather than speccing out each character based on their skillsets

also so many of the late joiners are terrible. The two orcs especially, they're understated and underleveled, and you'd have to reinvest ability level ups

pros:
-fire emblem
-skill tree customization
-weapon customization
-decent level design (non Fog)
-side objectives, challenge missions are all super fun
-customizable in difficulty and randomization!


cons:
-writing / too much dialogue, i just dont get invested enough
-class/character balance
-abilities being too strong makes you feel detached from combat (no counter attack, no dodging, penetrates resistances)

pick it up on sale or if you really like the genre Didn't have to do a FE three houses waifu simulator to upgrade my units. 10/10 Good It scratches that Fire Emblem itch for me. Or it scratched at least 90% of it. Definitely a big recommend from this gamer if that's your thing. 

My one complaint would be that the enemies need more special effects or ability to have higher stats (crit/etc) to make it more challenging (and fyi the plot is VERY cookie cutter but I'm not really here for that). Everything else is great. Voice acting really stands out in some scenes but I found some story sections had too much dialogue. I played Dark Deity 1 recently and really enjoyed it, so decided to get this one as soon as it released. This game made many improvements and while the weapon system is completely changed, most other systems were expanded and units gained abilities that could be used in combat. Overall it is a larger game than the first with more scenarios and extra optional challenges. I really enjoyed it and will be looking forward to any more future games.",0.17070840681951788

 Only the best PC game known to man. Great old game, just can't play anymore after I upgraded software. This *review* ONLY applies to the mac version of the game and its technical state - mostly.

The game feels like a pile of abandonware: it uses twice the disk space it specifies, crashes to the desktop frequently, is buggy and has texture lags. 

Pro for this game is the great number of mods available that do away with some of its most infantile parts, however, over half of those mods do not load or make the game crash. The ones that do load run poorly at best.

 More difficult than ""vanilla"" Civ IV, Beyond the Sword is a great expansion pack for people who enjoy Civ IV but find themselves wanting more. 
In ""vanilla"" Civ IV, espionage is very limited. For example, I mostly use spies in vanilla Civ IV to scout enemy territory and evade ambushes from their units. In BtS, espionage has been expanded with great attention to detail. I am still only scratching the surface of the possibilities of espionage in BtS because it's an entirely new and complex game concept that I'm having to navigate while also doing all the usual world building stuff in Civ.

UPDATE: it does play on Rift/Touch, I just had to add -force-d3d11 in the launch options. Great game! Well now... this is certainly a strange one.  Now, I've been a fan of Phr00t's games for a long time now, and have played most of them.  Going into any of them, I know to expect some surreal procedural weirdness, which is something that I really like but that most developers dont seem fond of doing (which is a shame).  I can think of only a few that are willing to make this sort of thing.  Phr00t though is one of them, and this game doesnt break the trend of creative bizarrity.

How do I even describe this one?  Okay.  So, think of Smash Bros, right?  Nintendo's wild fighting game, where instead of smacking your opponent until they pass out, you try to knock them off the stage to score a KO.  Well, it's like that, except in first person, and you punch eyeballs, except instead of punching you sorta throw rocks kinda?  And it's all procedural and you have an inventory.  Sometimes there's a boss or you solve a riddle, because why not.

The game does a good job of explaining the basics.  Your only true goal is to ascend, clearing 30 levels to end the run.  However you're also after a high score here, but how you go about things is up to you.  Each floor has portals that lead to the next one, but the portal activator has some sort of condition.  Maybe you have to find a star in a crate, or maybe you have to knock at least 5 weirdos off the stage.  Whatever it is, you'll traverse astonishingly strange landscapes in your pursuit of that goal.  Most levels are combat levels, but some will involve friendly eyes that give hints as to some sort of riddle, and you solve that instead.

Traversing the different levels is an experience, that's for sure.  These places sure arent boring, being a huge tangle of ramps, floating platforms, jump pads, and so on.  Phr00t's games, in my opinion, have always been very good at creating levels/worlds that I actually like exploring, and this game does that too.  However, it really takes some getting used to.  At first you can expect to be VERY confused and get lost easily.  After awhile, you'll get the hang of it though.  To help you out, these little green signs are posted everywhere, pointing in the direction of various things.  Learn to pay attention to those and your progress will get much easier.  

Each level will be populated with lots of eyeball dudes.  While sometimes they will fight each other, they will prioritize you if they spot you.  As is typical of games from this developer, they can attack from a seriously extreme range.  These arent enemies that have limited vision range.  The more damage you take, the further you'll be knocked back when you get hit, and the same with the eyeball guys.  You can tell how damaged they are by the fact that they get more and more red as you hit them, so it's easy to keep track of how much damage you've done, and to which enemies.   These guys are everywhere, and you're never safe.  What's more, some of them can cast nasty status effects, giving you all the more reason to learn to dodge them.  

Fortunately, that's not all there is in each level.  All sorts of things are there for you to find.  You have health recharge stations, and a station to undo status effects on each level... so pure attrition isnt going to kill you.  Getting a bit beat up early in the game cant ruin your entire run, which is good.  Items of all sorts can be found lying around too.  You have an inventory and can hold many of them at once (easily accessed with the mouse wheel).  There's all sorts of weapons, potions, passive effects, and so on.  These often have some randomization applied to them, so you never quite know what you'll get, particularly with weapons.  Whenever you fall to your doom, you'll respawn with full health, but you'll lose a random item out of your inventory.

Interestingly, there is no true lose condition.  This seems a bit strange to me, but it works out in the end.  You decide when you think you've lost.  If you've lost enough items that you just feel you're too weak to get further, that's a time to quit.  If you feel you can persist and overcome, you can do so.  It's an odd design decision, but one that I've seen before.

The difficulty overall is pretty high.  Enemies are aggressive, with fast shots that arent so easy to dodge.  Defending yourself isnt just about dodging, but also positioning and angles, so that when you do get hit, you're less likely to end up falling.  Like everything else in the game, combat takes alot of getting used to.  Fortunately there are no issues with the controls or anything.... mostly.  The ONE major thing that bugs me about the game:  There's no settings for mouse sensitivity.  It's not THAT big of a deal really, and doesnt stop my enjoyment of the game, but it's still annoying.  The one other, less major thing that bugs me is the portals.  Portals that go to the next level, and portals that go to the previous one, look exactly the same, except for the beam that shoots out of them.  It's easy to accidentally wander into the wrong portal if you're not paying attention to that beam.  It's a fairly minor issue to be honest... it mostly stopped happening for me after about 20 minutes, but it was still annoying.

Overall, this is a fairly simple and easy to understand game compared to some of the other ones.  It's not like the X089 series where there's a zillion stats and a gigantic workd to deal with.  This is a much more arcadey affair, not a gigantic adventure like those are. However, it does have the same ""feel"" that Phr00t's games usually do, if that makes sense. And again, this is fantastically strange... there just isnt anything else that plays like this, and there isnt much else that looks like it either.  As such, it's a very niche game.  You might really like it, or you might really hate it.  I personally quite like it, it's definitely my sort of thing, even if it can be frustrating at times.  I find myself coming back to this developer's games fairly often (particularly as they work on my junky other computer) and this one is likely to be no different. game where you throw stuff at eyeball dudes. i had some issues with the vr mode but its a funny game for 4 dollars. Unique take on the level-climbing roguelite. Combat is Smash Bros style, where damage only serves to increase knockback range, and all KOs are ring-outs. The variety of ""bashers"" (weapons) gives you a lot of options in combat style. Each one is completely viable too, avoiding the ""two or three good archetypes and a bunch of vendor trash"" trap that many randomized games fall into. Staying alive isn't just a matter of not getting hit, it's about not being too close to the edge when you do, especially if your damage is high. Recovery is possible if you get knocked off, but you can't count on it, especially if you're on the lower platforms of a level. Keeping track of where the restore powerups (debuff removal) and heal powerups are in the level is also critical, as you can find yourself needing one in a hurry. Falling isn't a game over, but you lose a random item when you do and if that item is your main basher it can bring your run to a grinding halt. Your inventory is ten slots, which is a good reason to hang onto old items just as a buffer to lower your odds of losing the good stuff if you fall.

The level randomization works well. Occasionally you get jump platforms or ramps to nowhere, but never inacessible platforms or jumps that are too difficult. Item randomization also stays balanced most of the time, but like all roguelikes/lites sometimes you roll an absurdly overpowered item that boosts you for a few levels, or have to make do with a string of not so good items. That unpredictability is part of the fun though. The learning curve is a bit steep, but since falling isn't a game over learning it isn't a grind, you're just probably not going to finish on your first run.

It's a simple game, but at four bucks you'll more than get your money's worth. Even if you don't plan on powering through the levels, just bashing on the floating eyeballs is a satisfying form of stress relief.

P.S. I don't have a VR set, so I can't comment on that. But this dev has done VR before and gotten good reviews on it, so I expect it's well executed. Hopefully someone with a Vive can confirm that here soon.

725780,Play With Me: Escape Room,game,False,"17 Jan, 2018","Action, Adventure, Casual, Indie, Racing, Simulation, Sports, Strategy","See how a game created by the very Jigsaw would look like! Use the available objects, outwit tricky illusions and optical puzzles and above all, answer the question ‚Äì will you dare to Play with Me?","It is a horror escape room puzzle point-and-click game where you and your wife have been kidnapped and must escape a killer's twisted ""Funhouse."" Each room presents a series of puzzles that you need to solve to progress.

For a low-budget indie game, it‚Äôs pretty well-made. You can definitely tell that there‚Äôs some inspiration drawn from the SAW franchise, especially in terms of atmosphere and audio design, which are done quite well. The puzzles are engaging at first, but after the first few rooms, they start to feel a bit repetitive.

On the downside, the voice acting feels pretty cringe, and the UI is a bit clunky. Also, the animation for pulling out your phone or matches is slow, which can be frustrating, especially when you‚Äôre trying to solve puzzles quickly. It feels like the protagonist is underwater, and that just slows down the pacing of the game.

If you‚Äôre into achievements, this one is easy to 100%.

Overall, while the game isn‚Äôt perfect, it‚Äôs still unique and different from other horror-puzzle games. If you're a horror and puzzle fan, it's worth a try‚Äîjust pick it up at a heavy discount to get the most value out of it. Didn't run very well, lacks polish (but is Polish) and variety, lost interest in the puzzles as the game went on. Good have been much better if more effort and subtlety went into the puzzles. Tedious puzzles, boring gameplay. *""Play With Me"" is a thrilling escape room horror game that will put your brain to the test. With its eerie atmosphere, clever puzzles, and unsettling surprises, it keeps you on edge while challenging your problem-solving skills. Perfect for fans of psychological horror and mind-bending riddles, this game delivers an immersive experience that will keep you hooked until the very end! idk the game is shit af. Finished the first 3 or 4 rooms but got bored to death. I could give it a chance and push through but naaaaaaah. DROPPED XD I enjoyed playing this game, though there were a few things that made it a bit annoying at times. The puzzles are pretty creative and each one feels unique, which kept things fresh. However, some of the code puzzles were a bit off, the solutions didn't always make logical sense, which meant getting stuck and a bit frustrated here and there.

The game doesn‚Äôt go too heavy on horror, so don‚Äôt expect constant scares, but it does have a few solid jump scares. the story was interesting, letting you confused about the whole situation until you finish the game and also keeps you engaged with the short ""interactions"" between the others characters.

There‚Äôs also cool element like mini-games on the in-game phone. They don‚Äôt affect the main story, but they were a fun break from the puzzles. I think it would‚Äôve been interesting if there was an achievement related to them. 
Overall, while the puzzles might be a bit frustrating at first, the game‚Äôs originality and story make it worth a play.
Took about 5 hours to complete the whole game, achievements included.

[quote=][b] For more reviews, check my[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45284670/] Curator's Page  [/url][/b][/quote] The game seems alright but it has some game breaking bugs that haven't been addressed anymore for a couple of years. One of them being a game breaking bug that doesn't let you continue with the game, in a bugged keypad for a door in one of the rooms (""Crosswords"" room). Some people have reported some issues with the menus and other parts too. So In it's current abandoned state I wont recommend buying it. –í–∏–∑—É–∞–ª –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å–Ω—ã–π, –∏–¥–µ—è –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å–Ω–∞—è... –Ω–æ —Ä–µ–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—è... —É–∂–∞—Å....

The UI could be improved a lot more. Having to go to the pack and scroll to find the item I need was annoying. There weren't that many items ingame. They all could've fit in much smaller frame.

There were some puzzles that were fun, both easy and difficult. But others... How did/do people solve them? I had to restart several time duo to bad number. Very hard to see. Other puzzles suddenly use letters, fine. But an elevator that shows only numbers, needs a word also? A single keypad that needs three separate words halfway ingame.

Why the puzzle difficulty wasn't more linear is the more confusing puzzle. Wanting to have as many diffirent rooms as possible at the cost of quality.

Sorry I can't recommend this one. Incredibly boring with a non sensible story and a lame ""twist"" at the end. Easy enough 10 achievements though so it get's a few points for that. It's very short as well, the only reason I have almost 4 hours is because I forgot the game open when I went shopping. Overall 4/10 and it's only that high because of easy 100% achievements.",-0.010749874023683551

very worth while
good money used üëç Okay, I'm not much into pixel graphics and also not a fan of this 2D-platformer type, I'm also not into gore theme. By this time you probably think why the hell I said I recommend that? Because this game is so satisfying by its little story, by the puzzles (yes, switching this or that levers and finding, gathering your next yummy DOES feel like a puzzle). And the gore part thanks to pixel graphics was not so much gross. It also gives you a choice of how to act - to barge in and crush everything around in one blow or to sneaky beat them, moving step by step, hitting one by one, devouring piece by piece... Sometimes. Sometimes it doesn't. But hey, evolving means being smarter too, not only bigger.

10 out of 10? No. 10000 out of 10000? Yes. <3 Its good very short game but is fun to try speedrun I like how you get to play as the monster.
 But the puzzels and fights are good too :) Found this game from Pewdiepie on YT from 2020, and after 5 years I finally got it. Both the experience and gameplay are worth it. It's fun to finish all achievements and play mods from the workshop, although the campaign is very short the fun lasted for when you wanna experience being an intelligent tentacle alien monster. It's a great game, cool monster and abilities and perhaps it's a skill issue on my part but like many other I have gotten lost I spent God know how long trying to finding where's the next containment units are. I wish the dev would add a DNA called spatial memory ( basically a map). Otherwise nice game, I hope for a sequel one day (with a map). 7.5/10

*edit: kinda a miss opportunity to not have a secret ending if you took too long to find a DNA, the game would end and a description would say something like the monster got lost and died of starvation Fun game. Parts where I thought there wasn't a solution but I finished it. Satisfying.

1082000,A Night at the Races,game,False,"13 Dec, 2019","Action, Casual, Indie",Play as a guy who is trying to beat a platformer to pay his debts.,"Interesting and unique idea for a platformer but the game just feels absolutely atrocious to play. The controls feel extremely jerky and awkward, the camera is way too zoomed in, and many of the mechanics are just plain annoying. I wanted to like this game, but sadly it is a little too wonky for me.

I played through roughly half the game, seeing as there are 12 worlds and I am on world 6 right now, but it just keeps annoying me more and more.

The Pros:

- The story inbetween isn't much, but I liked that little world and would have liked to know, why the stuff is going on, that is going on. I don't know if it explains it all at the end, but so far I was always happy for a little break to click on a new message.

- The graphics are clear, you can clearly see the path you want to take and most of the time, how to approach it.

- The controls are very responsive, feels pretty good to use.. however..

The Cons:

- For me personally, it feels a little too fast to react to stuff you have not seen yet. There are all kinds of moments where you will die, because you'll need to remember how the level is built to properly maneuver through them. I know that the game has an assist mode, but I've played through all kinds of incredibly hard platformers in my life and never did I need to use some kind of assist mode. If this was the only complaint on my end, I am sure that I would have powered through, since I love a challenge and hard games in general. It's just that it doesn't really feel fair in this game. 

- You don't see enough of the level. This point is probably an extension to my previous point, but if you could see more, you could react better. Sometimes there are ""springs"" that launch you up into a deathtrap, to which you can only really react, if you know that its there beforehand. Its a cheap death everytime it happens.

- The next point is what made me stop playing this game any further:
It feels bugged. I don't know if everything i've encountered is intentional or not. there are times where you get launched by the little enemies that you need to kill/collect and get so much speed from it, that it launches you THROUGH the walls. I played a bunch of levels that I felt like were way harder than they had to be, just because I had to play around the fact that it would launch me somewhere I am probably not supposed to be. (might even be intentional, but it feels like a bug to me at least)

- Lastly, I reaaaally dislike games that don't let me play in windowed mode, since I play ALL my games in a window. I noticed that if you spam Esc in the menus, it slips into some form of windowed mode, but it doesn't work properly and cuts of parts of the game, and I guess wasn't even intended to work, since I just tried to quit the game at that time, which made me figure it out by accident.

As much as it annoyed me, I also had a lot of fun, but the bad things just kept piling up the further i got. If I could, I'd give a rating between ""Yes"" or ""No"" But as I gotta decide, I gotta say no.

Theres definitely fun to be had though! Fun and unique platformer with a cool story, kind of like geometry dash. A Night at the Races is a fun game with an intriguing story.

It's basically consisted of two intertwined games. One is an adventure game, the other is a platformer one. After playing a certain level of platformer levels, you continue the adventure (story) sequence. After the adventure sequence, the platformer game continues and so on.

The adventure part has an gripping story, supported by great visuals. The developer of the game is really talented in story telling. The puzzles are quite easy, I considered the adventure part as interactable cutscenes, which didn't bother me at all. I kept wondering what would happen next in the story.

The platformer game is extremely hard and unforgiving in default, while it's labeled as ""Normal"" mode. Fortunately, it's possible to change the difficulty of the game, which makes the game much more enjoyable for people who are not platformer experts. I started to enjoy the fun of the mechanics in the easy mode.

In conclusion, this is a game with a gripping story, which might require you to choose the easy difficulty to enjoy the game unless you are a game expert. I came into this game with the mistaken belief that I was somewhat good at platformers. 20 hours and 120 levels later I'm leaving with the knowledge that I'm trash, as well as a blister on my thumb and a deeply ingrained hatred for berries.

Worth a look if you're into the super-hard platforming genre. Super tight camera and auto-run/jump controls means you don't have time to plan a route, it's pretty much all either reflexes and reaction or brute muscle memory. Pretty decent worldbuilding outside of the platforming segments, and the point and click portions provided a good pallet cleanser, but overall the story was sparse. 20 minutes in and I'm hooked. I came to see what others said about the game.
Its quite addictive but I might have to change the difficulty to casual. A good challenging platformer.
Game is simply without much story, you control a box and you need to jump at the right moment to climb up, and make sure not to miss any enemies.

What I begin to find it difficult is to do the jump - dashing and break walls at the same time. 
I stopped right before I got angry about myself.
 The game is definitely unique and is decent in concept

Unfortunately I just wasn't a huge fan of the platforming. 
-The camera is zoomed in way too far for how fast paced the game is.
-The player movement and mechanics just feel a bit too clunky and ""jerky""
-There is no quick restart button when you are trying to speedrun the stages for ""perfect"" status.

The camera being zoomed in too far is the biggest issue. If this was adjusted it would alleviate the clunkiness issue, and you would have to restart far less while speedrunning because you would actually be able to look and plan ahead a bit more rather than basically being forced to rely on pure memorization of the level.

Speedrunning is obviously always about memorization to some extent, but its much easier to remember what is next when you can see more than 1/2 a second into the stage. 

Just using Super Meat Boy or Celeste as comparison, you can only see about 25% to 50% as much of the stage at one time. Awesome and unique style and visuals paired with few simple controls, yet filled with levels that demand everyhting from you from the beginning onwards to not make a single mistake if you do not want to redo the whole level. Outstanding platformer. At the intersection of SMB and Papers Please, this game offers a great deal of fun. The platformer part was quite challenging, and you can immediately bounce back from failure, which reminds me of Hotline Miami in the sense of game feel. 
The point-and-click part had stunning scenes that gives the feeling of a dystopian universe. The game delivers that unique atmosphere with a very tasty aesthetic.
Although the game has a vast untapped potential, I blame the recommendation algorithms and the way that market works against indies, which portrays this masterpiece of art as a humble underdog. Ten years before, a game like this easily would have a cult following. 
I strongly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the games mentioned above.",0.07528373302182824

1394140,You Can Pet The Dog VR,game,False,"28 Aug, 2020","Casual, Indie, Simulation","Fulfill the ultimate fantasy: going outside and petting a dog. In You Can Pet The Dog VR, players can pet and play with an adorable dog in a beautiful environment inspired by the upcoming game DOGGONE.","10/10 best game never has there been a more necessary purchase wow really bad... I'm giving this game a thumbs down, but I'm not negative about it. 

When I started the game the graphics jumped out at me, it's very colorful. I was very happy with my first impression. It feels like you're in a Disney cartoon. My pet dog was waiting for me and I spotted a bone, stick and ball I could throw. Unfortunately I couldn't reach any of them as the VR ground was lower than my physical floor. So I had to go into my oculus settings and fake a higher physical floor in order to reach stuff in this game... Petting the dog was also a disappointment to me as the dog barely responds to it. 

If I compare this to the robot dog in the free game The Lab, that dog was more interactive and felt much more real. 

Having pointed all of this out, I hope they will fix the bugs and make the dog much more interactive like make it roll over to rub its belly. I've waited for this kind of thing for many months and for the price of 4 euros I will keep the game and see if my nephew and niece enjoy it as much as the robot dog. I just wanted to take a moment and say that I truly love this game :) This is the greatest VR game I have ever played. As far as dog petting VR games go, this is a dog petting VR game that includes a dog that you can pet. I was a bit skeptical at first given that other VR games I have played did not include a dog to pet, however, my worries were for naught as this game started with a dog that I could indeed pet. Now petting the dog is not the only thing you can do in this game. You can also throw various items that the dog will then fetch and bring back to you. If you decide that this particular pup's fetching prowess is worthy of a pet, then oh boy let me tell you... you can pet the dog.
 Now what the dev does not tell you about this game is that it takes place in a world where gravitational anomalies can occur. When I was exhausted of petting the dog, I threw the stick. The dog then proceeded to fetch the stick and bring it back, so I went ahead and took the stick from the dog in preparation to throw the stick again. However, I grabbed the stick with my left hand, I am not left handed. This posed a minor inconvenience. I went to transfer the stick to my right hand and the stick became stuck in my body. In surprise I let go of the stick and the dog went to fetch the stick that was now stuck inside of my body. What happened next still haunts me....
 As the dog went to fetch the stick, my body expelled the stick at incredible speeds... like how you push bullets out of your body in most first person shooters to regain health. This propelled the dog at an angle straight into the air. I could only stare on in horror as my perfectly pet worthy pooch spiraled out of control into the atmosphere. Still in shock, I quickly grabbed another throwable object, the frisbee, to see if I could summon the dog back to earth. However, this had unforeseen consequences which may have set into motion events that I cannot fathom as of this moment. As I threw the disc shaped potential canine savior, the dog fell from the heavens. I watched as my wayward pup slowly descended behind the treeline, never to be seen again. I do believe what I encountered was the canonical intro to the game DOGGONE, hopefully a developer can specify.
 In conclusion, this game does exactly what it says it would. Is it worth 5 dollars? It really depends on how much you want to pet a dog in VR. Can I ever forget the horrific event that unfolded before my eyes? Probably not.",0.05607664995822891
1011090,ANDROMALIUS,game,False,"9 May, 2019","Indie, Simulation","Spending the first night in a new apartment can be quite nervewracking. New sounds, and thin walls that seperate you from others in the complex. Do you trust your new surroundings?","No Achievements. I streamed this game live in Twitch and my viewers loved it.  Alot  of fun and really enjoyed it.  Proud of myself for finishing the game.  https://youtu.be/2xT0KrZlDA8 Around 40 minutes gameplay time, tense atmosphere, barely depicted backstory.
Successful enough for a low-budget indie horror (more like thriller) game! üëç The scariest part was how loud the doors shut behind you. Like taking a nuke to the ear. This is one of the ""short horror experience"" games
I have played quite a few of these and based on that I can say that this one isnt really worth your time.
It is not a bad game, but compared to other titles this one just didnt caught my interest in any way.
Best thing about this game is that it's short ...
If you are looking for this kind of game but better quality i would recommend Chilla's Art games or EMIKA_GAMES
 A short and fun game with plenty of jump scares Enjoyable horror.  It's short but well executed.  In a limited runtime it managed to establish the scene, build atmosphere, and deliver a few well earned scares along the way.
It can be a bit confusing what you need to do to trigger the next step in the game but that's just nitpicking.
Recommended. I suck at writing reviews but this is a great game if you like exploring really creepy scenarios.
It has lots of jumpscares, which I absolutely love!
I'm looking forward to their next release :) Only get if it's on sale or you love completing games at 100% with achievements as I did nothing special and got them all. I love walking sim games but there's gotta be a good story attached to it which this one did not.  Also, for walking sims, this one was either, all you did was walk with nothing at all happening, or when there was something, it forced you to stand still which was a lot near the end. Also calling itself an interactive horror story, I wish there had been more ways to interact with things instead of having to walk in circles until the game decided to give you the item it was forcing you to wait for.

Also, I'm a coward in most games which is why I picked up this game ( i wanted to get over the fear ) and most of the time, I was so bored from walking around, I pleaded for the game to kill me so I wouldn't have to walk around again.

So you did it game, you successfully made me want to reach for something scarier. Constructive feedback would be to have more things interact with to showcase the story it was trying to tell.  Maybe being able to read different text messages on the phone or things on the computer. Definitely recommend if you're looking for something spooky, without having to stealth around or fight enemies. It's a good short walking simulator with easy 100% achievements! Well worth the price and time",0.11809428316781258
780710,TURRET SYNDROME VR,game,False,"25 Jan, 2018","Action, Indie, Strategy, Early Access","Tower Defense game in first person view, it can be played in VR with Oculus Rift or in non VR.","This is the origin of the long drive It a very fun Game, but it very bugy neat little time killer, its pretty jank so dont expect to be able to trickshot a zombie with a turret backflip. But if the dev put alittle effort in it could be a pretty alright game. As of writing this review game has received few updates with no plans to continue, too many control One of my favorite games,only bad part is it needs a little working on, its to wonky great game from 49 cents and i even has vr but i haven't tried vr yet cause i don't have one I love this game so much. It's quite janky though. If only they hadn't abandoned the game, it would have been great. TURRET SYNDROME VR is an abandoned early access tech demo/wave survival shooter that the developer misleadingly advertises as working in both VR and non-VR modes, however, the controls don't work properly if you're not using a VR controller, so the game is unplayable.  Deceptive marketing, what a surprise, but the developers here seem to have a few unethical behaviours under their belt. 

I don't think this is an asset flip, the game assets are too primitive for a professional developer to create (this is a different problem in itself).  However the developer very likely ripped off a basic template for a VR game in Unity and just dropped some crap assets on it.  The value for gamers here is no different than an asset flip. 

The game was abandoned roughly 2 weeks after launch and hasn't been updated in almost 6 years.  It blew past the developers commitment to complete the game without any notification or admission of failure from the developer.  The game will never be completed.

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

The game features lazy low-polygon ""retro"" assets, making this look like a barely functional 3D game from the 1990s.  It's unclear why the developers weren't able to arrange high quality, high polygon count contemporary assets for the game, and also irrelevant... what matters is that this looks bad as a result of their decisions, a compromise PC gamers shouldn't have to put up with.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 3 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

Another unethical act of this developer, knowing full well that this game is abandoned and they will never complete it, they are deliberately trying to scam gamers into buying it by offering it on discount from time to time.  It's impossible to ""accidentally"" discount a game.  The developer looked at their abandoned game, and instead of doing the right thing and removing it from Steam, they instead doubled-down and tried to scam even more people into paying for it.  Greedy, and completely unethical.  Doing the wrong thing, on purpose, for money.  This is not okay.

Furthering the unethical nature of this developer, while they are selling this incomplete game under Valve's failed Early Access program, they're abusing that program, and not working on this game full time, as they have other projects in the works.  That means there's ZERO confidence anyone who buys this in Early Access will receive a complete game, and it's possible that they're being scammed.

TURRET SYNDROME VR is relatively cheap at $1 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, and the questionable ethical nature of the developer and/or their associates (as outlined above), this is impossible to recommend.

Too hard to see the end. this is coming from someone who has beaten the game.

ok. this game is really good, dont get me wrong. the art style and gameplay mechanics of the game make it pretty unique. however, an incredible ammount of effort is needed, and upgrades get increasingly more expensive, yet they feel as if they dont do much for your plane. you cant play anything else until you beat the campaign, and dont eveng et me started on it. some parts of the game constantly kill you, and they really frustrate you. there isnt much variety, either, with the mobile game literally having better planes than the version you payed for.

also, i believe the best plane in the game costs no actual money, yet isnt available for the main game that you payed around 7 bucks for. this game is quite frustrating, and i think this should only be bought if you want a challenge, and like the odds against you.

Bad port. Having completed the game I really struggle to recommend it. Clunky controls, weird game design, bad balance and lack of common sense - this game has it all. Most of these issues can be fixed with some polish, but I'm not sure this will ever happen. this game is way too difficult its easier to play dark souls Even after upgrading your plane to the max, it is so difficult to complete a mission it is not even fun anymore.  Stay away from this one! fun game with quite a lot of planes from biplane to bf109 and onwoards which you can all configure and upgrade in a lot of ways. i don¬¥t know how a superfortress flies in this game but i¬¥ll sure find out :D
for this price it¬¥s absolutely worth it. there are some translations missing (nothing important) but the rest is well done. I played on phone, very good game, other also, nice climat and artstyle

I'm always on the hunt for arcade-style sports games to play with friends on the sofa and PBA really hit the spot. 

A few more power ups rather than the electro dunk one would be great additions and a bit more thought into making 3-pointers more viable would really make this game great. 

I also can't help but think it would work a lot better as a 3v3 on the court.

One issue I found was that the controllers sometimes disconnected for a second while playing and the game does not have an in-game 'select sides' option. This meant that once a controller disconnected, the game had to be restarted which was really frustrating and the reason why we eventually turned it off. works amazing on steam deck.

This game was laying on my library has been a while, finally i finished playing it and i loved it, the story make me think about my life and stuff, it is a great game. Highly recommend I took no joy in the scant few minutes I played  before bowing out.  Miserable game- which seems to be the point here. Pretty relaxing to do some research that doesn't have your actual career and finances depend on it.  5 stars Although cute and well-made, I wasn't expecting to get so hyper depressed about reliving our hellish capitalist landscape I didn't play much so you can't trust my opinion, but this game is depressing. Which is mildly amusing, because it is about a dog :( Only do science for a living if you REALLY love it. Well this was quite depressing story. At least the end is kind of ok. There could be some improvements for the controls (sometimes you click on a machine and dog just stands there doing nothing). 
Overall an interesting short game, definetly worth the 2$ it asks. I purchased this game as I was finishing college in order to have a job working in a laboratory. This game made me laugh cry as someone who has had this type of job before. It is incredibly accurate with its detailings of life in the lab and spot on with how long some forms of machines take versus other in the matter of operation. This is a cute little game that is easy to sit down and play a day or two of without spending hours on, and is very quick and easy to get the hang of. Great for relieving stress during finals! This game is hilarious for all the wrong reasons... 

It's a game about working efficiently, not really a game outside of it's cute graphics and terrible Engrish rather a training tool for an awful life in East Asia. 

Seriously, the premise is: work like a dog, try to make your boss happy, try to spend your meager wages on food healthy enough to let you survive, do your laundry so your clothes are clean and then sleep... Oh and get some text messages from your mom...

As for the R18 Patch is really soooo good. Yet it still needs more improvements, specifically when the sister becomes naughty.

 great artwork This game is so good it cured my crippling depression. But made me depressed when i realized i can never experience this in real life. 10/10 Very Recommend :D Surprisingly Well-Made, Deeply Replayable ‚Äì But Not for Everyone

Okay‚Ä¶ this might be an embarrassing one to review, but someone‚Äôs gotta be honest about it. Monotone Sister honestly earns its ‚ÄúOverwhelmingly Positive‚Äù rating‚Äîit‚Äôs far more well-designed than I expected going in, with a stat-building system that‚Äôs engaging and satisfying to play with.

The core gameplay follows a weekly cycle: during weekdays, you‚Äôre working with your guild to train skills, fight monsters, or manage your tavern and town. It‚Äôs a good blend of RPG and life sim elements. Evenings let you make more personal choices‚Äîrest, explore, train, or spend time with characters‚Äîbut your options depend on how much energy you‚Äôve got left from the day. It‚Äôs not just about stat building, it‚Äôs also about relationship development and balancing your schedule.

The weekends, though? That‚Äôs when the game opens up. You get more freedom, more energy, and a lot more chances to pursue relationships, dive deeper into character interactions, or strengthen yourself further with extra training. It feels like a reward for your weekly grind‚Äîand it‚Äôs a great time to experiment with different choices that impact your path toward one of the many endings (good or bad).

Now‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs be real about the content. This game does explore adult and taboo themes, and yes‚Äîyou‚Äôll need to install a patch to unlock all of that. I wasn‚Äôt super familiar with this genre before playing, and I didn‚Äôt expect it to go as far as it does. But I‚Äôll admit: I get the appeal. If you‚Äôre okay with some edgy, risqu√© material, there‚Äôs something uniquely fun and surprisingly deep here. But if taboo content isn‚Äôt your thing, this may be one to skip.

All in all, it‚Äôs a smartly built, emotionally layered stat-sim that‚Äôs way more than just shock value. If you‚Äôre curious, open-minded, and love character-driven progression‚Äîthis one‚Äôs worth your time. quite possibly the game portion of a porn game I've ever played. download the patch and get the dlc. unironically really good turn based combat with well paced daily life mechanics. I hope for a sequel and it's not even about the sexual content, I like the story and gameplay that much. it has changed my opinion on these games and made me more willing to try them in the hopes that I find a genuinely good game and chase that high again. I didn't even realize it was a porn game at first I genuinely thought it was just a stylized and good fantasy rpg at first. Boy was I wrong. This game is sick as fuck...but just so am I.

It's a shame 'cos otherwise the game, though limited in scope, could be enjoyable. Easy to learn. At historical level you get much of the flavor of Napoleonic combat. Excellent graphics and audio, progressively more difficult battle scenarios requiring you to change tactics and respond to changing situations.  A definite must for any one who, like me, grew up on table top war games with hundreds of carefully painted minature Napleonic figures and dice! Easy to learn to play and familiar to wargamers. Not particularly sophisticated but good entertainment Lots of fun and pretty challenging , especially in the higher difficulty settings. Covers the Peninsular War campaign of Wellington. Timewise, this happened around the same time as the Russian campaign of Napoleon. Gameplay is as most HexWars games. Decent array of scenarios. If you are comfortable with HexWars style, recommended. Great Game!  Difficult enough to be challenging , simple enough to be enjoyable. If you are interested in the Napoleonic Wars , are familiar with  strategy and tactics , you will probably wish  for Hexwar Games to cover this  period  as well as  their  excellent Civil War and Tank Battle series. The soundtracks are riveting , promoting just one more battle, but could be improved by more varied  period pieces. Thank You for producing these games! Luv all Hexwar games so easy to play well worth a buy if you like hex war gameing.

Thumbs up from me 10/10 Simplistic and solid and enjoyable representation of Napoleonic warfare.  A bit concerned about the ease with which infantry in unformed or skirmish formation form square when charged by cavalry but otherwise I have not found any problem with the game engine.  Artillery merge would be good as in Gettysburg but not essential to playability.  I love this game at the price....Look forward to Wellington's victory when it is released. Overall, this is a fun Napoleonic wargaming experience. A must play for wargamers and history buffs. So fun I could hear Richard Sharpe and Patrick Harper telling me that I needed to do my best to beat Boney.",0.2181678773204197
2144130,Loop Frogs,game,False,"2 Aug, 2024","Action, Casual, Indie","Guide two froggy friends through a pixelated, time-warping adventure. This 2D platformer will require you to master the time loop and leap your way across 30+ levels of hazards and puzzles.","frog

Ok but no really, this is an amazing little game. The main story is short and cute, with the levels gradually increasing in difficulty and complexity with no severe difficulty spikes. The cutscenes are kept short and add in a bit of humour and charm. The collectables and target times for each level, as well as the hidden secret levels, add a huge degree of replayability, and the achievements help keep you hooked: I'm about 10 hours in, and I still haven't done everything this game has to offer! The music is amazing and perfectly fits the vibe, and the frog sound effects are adorable. It's not a perfect game - pushing for the fastest times can show some inconsistent physics in the time-loops from Green - but it certainly comes close.

If you're a fan of 2D platformers, puzzles, the 90s, humour, or frogs, absolutely give this a try! 10+ hours of content for a fiver is nothing to sniff at! Very strongly recommend.

Spoiler: [spoiler] The frogs win [/spoiler]
V1.17.8 frog [h1] It's a great game [/h1]
I played for like 1.5 hours and saw it had been 3 hours (to make it clear I played for 3 Hours) [b] time flies by [/b] I beat the game, and I'm thinking about doing it again as a speed run, It was a bit frustrating learning the controls and I wish there was a bit of a tutorial but I just enjoyed it, it was great fun.
[h1] highly recommend. [/h1] Loop frogs is a retro style game that'll inject your brain full of nostalgic pleasure.
It's a puzzle based game that is great to run through but also has a level of difficulty that will push what you think is actually possible in the game.
The retro style graphics are such a pleasure to see in new games and will bring back memories of your mum shouting at you to turn it off and come downstairs for dinner.
I wish there was more games like this around.

""JUST FIVE MORE MINUTES MUM, I JUST NEED TO FINISH THIS LEVEL!!"" This game is devilishly addictive and very clever. Its not easy at all, but not so hard that you give up on it. So far, I have only once picked up my laptop to throw it against the wall. but i think thats a sign of a good game. I look forward to playing more games from these creators. A fun game that hits you in the retro feels.

Still got to go back and work on my times but one day I will have mastered every level.

And still have a couple of hidden achievements to work out too.

Highly recommended Great game, I enjoyed solving each levels unique puzzles, and the interesting mechanics of the game. These frogs are fun, funny and great role models for amphibians thinking about a career in the sciences. So far the games really good!
The art is really cool and it actually makes me use my brain lol
Only criticism is that sometimes when i try to double jump it only does it once. 
It seems to work fine if I run then jump but its not that big of a deal
Still pretty cool game Cant wait to finish it!",0.12950079538934955
418440,Tick Tock Isle,game,False,"19 Nov, 2015","Adventure, Casual, Indie","Strike is inadvertently transported into the past while attempting to repair a mysterious, abandoned clock tower. ¬†Endeavoring to return to the future, Strike must fix both the time machine and the island‚Äôs dysfunctional family who are responsible for much of the clock‚Äôs disrepair.","I enjoyed this. For less than a dollar on sale worth it, just wish it had achievements. trash Love the art style but most of the gameplay so far I've noticed is just going from room to room-why are they so many interconnected?-and getting lost. Tick Tock Isle is a bite-sized adventure game that pays homage to the point-and-click adventures of old but trims absolutely all the fat and leaves you with a condensed and charming experience.

The game has an inventory, a map, and several screens of the titular island and the house on it, but the game only has four buttons, and three of them are directional movement keys. In short, the game streamlines all interactions and inventory fiddling by handing out items for you and using them in the environment when appropriate.

The result is a roughly 1 hour long game (a bit less if you have great sense of direction and a bit of luck) peppered with classic nonsensical item and NPC combinations you used to have in SCUMM games and a neat little ending that ties everything together... or does it?

Some find the straightforward interface limiting and grating, but I found it brilliant; go into this game with without expecting more than what it has on offer and I think you won't be disappointed. Tick Tock Isle hides a surprising amount of creativity and attention to detail wrapped in a little time-traveling package. And it's got a couple of poems in there too!

For the price tag, it's an absolute steal and a great way to try something different. The music was the best part, and the family dynamics were cute, but it was really frustrating going from room to room just hoping something would happen, had to end up looking up a guide to even know what I was supposed to do.

View more honest reviews on my youtube channel CozyAriGames <3 This game is a STEAL for 99 cents! What the heck!? It's ""short"" being a couple hours to complete everything most likely, BUT I prefer that honestly, like watching a good movie. It was extremely cool and funny and rewarding to work through this story. Squiddershins always makes cute, fun, clever little games I am 32 years old.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Im on a quest of at least trying every game in my library, of which I got plenty from all kinds of bundles, not all though. If you are interested in my journey, check out my other reviews :) Decent little platformer. Its kind of brainless though. I made it to a certain point but it was nice to play. ""Each month I will add 10 new levels"" ??? I know the game is old but please it should be better to remove that false message. Also I think that initially you could add more levels to the game as it was really simple. The art style is good and cute. I should say that is a nice starting portfolio project. Avvruk Cute game, but not too difficult. I could say a baby mario version. Nice chill out game. very good built but too few levels Far too slow and simplistic for a platformer of this style. The difficulty is far too inconsistent as well. Previously removed from steam Kek Story

1385850,City of Broken Dreamers Game Guide,dlc,False,"7 Aug, 2020",Indie,A helpful guide to navigate your way through Book One of City of Broken Dreamers,"To be honest, I never used this guide and tried to choose all the ways myself 
Although the game is so difficult that the player really needs a guide, if you really think you are confused in the game and don't know how to choose, this DLC is a good option :))) It's just a PDF guide. It's not exhaustive - certain things are missing here and there, but it's decent enough to help you navigate through the game. There are a lot of hidden things, ambiguous choices and unpredictable outcomes in CoBD, so this guide can come in handy. Recommended for the second or third playthrough. Great comprehensive guide for the game with many twists and turns. My only question is there a guide like this for Book 2? This is not an in game guide, but a pdf.

I don't recommend as you can likely find the game for free elsewhere, but if you want to download a pdf (and it's still there to download if you want it again in a couple of years), it's fine. It helped me unlock the library, so it served its purpose. Don't know if PhillyGames is aware but this guide is also posted on the Guides section of the Community Page. I used that guide first and since there are still some scenes I need to unlock I figured buying the ""official guide"" DLC would help. But nope, it's the same. So even as an Official Guide the guide fails at revealing every dialog/choice result.

I guess this is a case of buy the guide to support the dev, otherwise you're fine using the freebie copy which I think goes against the terms of service and should be removed. The story is interesting, but some of the writing is better than others. It can vary between good and sort of sophomoric. The sex animations are fairly generic, but the character models are very good. There are certainly better examples of this type of game, but it is probably worth the price for the story. The guide do provide some assistance, however, it is still a huge disappointment as it only provides guidance with part of the scenes. DO NOT TRUST THE GUIDE! It will not unlock you the hidden scenes. It will only give you a rough idea how it gonna play out if you choose certain options. The Game Guild is very good, with many explanations and to highly recommended. Furthermore it is a additional support for the developers. If you are not sure, play it once and then decide if you want to continue supporting them and find out everything.

There are some free guides out there in the ether, but with these you will still miss or not experience some things. Yeah, both the main menu ""official guide"" button and the guide button under the ""Help and Guide"" tab do nothing. You have to go into your steamapps-->common-->City of Broken Dreamers Book One-->game-->cobd-guide(PDF file) in order to view the guide.

‚≠ê [b]–û—Ü—ñ–Ω–∫–∞: 9/10[/b] Turns out I really love Dungeon Crawlers. Terrible game, there's only one massive dungeon. And where are my cutscenes???

Where can I buy character skins for $15/ea.? And why is there no Team Deathmatch game type? Still a fantastic old-school style RPG brought to a well devised 3D rendition. I haven't encountered any bugs, atmosphere is perfect, gameplay is easy enough to get into but fresh enough to keep it from being repetitive, and the world building is straight out of a D&D campaign. Legend of Grimrock 1 and 2 are two amazing games.
I haven't played much classic dungeon crawlers, only Might&Magic X Legacy, which has fun quests and dialogue, but is slightly less dynamic that LoG

Personally I like to limit myself to characters from 1 race. Minotaurs will feel clunky. Ratmen and Lizards quite strong.
Riddles in LoG1 usually are really ridiculous and will end up with online guide. In LoG2 you can figure most of them yourself, only one or two will be unsolvable.

Gameplay is relatively easy, so taking additional challenge may be fun.
-Hard mode in first game is brutal with elite enemies one shoting your warriors. Expect reloading saves. In LoG2 difficulty doesn't feel nearly as tough.
-No map is terribly demanding in first game, as whole adventure takes place inside one dungeon, every floor and corridor looks identical. In LoG2 we explore more enviroments so it's navigation is managable recalling objects around us.
-Saving At and One use crystals (only LoG2, for achievement both need to be on) not recommended for first playthrough due to traps, 2h between saves. The single use is not an obstacle tho.

[h1]Mild spoilers[/h1]
Enemies respawn sometimes. Your party should reach 70 skill points (LoG1) or level 14 (LoG2). Some enemies early on can be immune to Earth/Poison magic, but it's still strong thru the game. Dodge is little unreliable for front characters, thus ignoring armor skill is valid option even on hard (both LoG1 2),. Great music.

Making their way forward, the player builds the future of their character, earning money and respect, buying real estate, cars, and climbing the career ladder.","Just not worth it. It is VERY basic and more like something you would find online for free but not even that. I would not recommend spending any money for this game. where to begin with the glorious game known as Business Simulator,, or triple B as I like to call it.. Boring, Broken, and Borked.. This game is fun, if you enjoy playing a game that is pointless,, in fact this game is more then just pointless, it's a buggy and broken mess..

I gave this game a chance, even after Mc. Shady revoker keys, decided to take a giant flaming dump on people who bought his game via a bundle.. I guess breaking business agreements is what Mr. Shady Dev does best.. Another in a long list of snatch and grabbers< who snatch your money and run with it.... then try to make up excuses and lies to excuse their bad behavior.. but anyway lets get back to the actual game play..

Did I say gameplay, excuse me, the clicking of a button every minute, while you stare at absolutely nothing but a screen with the inability to do much of anything, other then scroll through a bunch of other screens where you can't do anything..

This game tried to be a clicker game, but it's like a clicker game being played by Grandma Rosie, the 105 year old woman with carpal tunnel, who manages to click a staggering 4 times per minute.. I guess this game might have been fun, if you could manage to stomach playing it for more then a few minutes at a time.

Ultimately you'd be better off doing anything else with your money rather then buy this game.. I mean after all, the dev stole enough of our money as it is.. no need to give him more.. The fact steam allows people like this to release broken buggy, almost non games on their service and then sell hundreds of keys to bundle sites, only to revoke them due to the ease with which valve leaves the dev tools open to any Tom ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• or Harry..

If you really still want to buy this game have fun throwing your money down a giant hole,, with this type of shady developer don't say I didn't warn you when they eventually release the patch with the keylogger/miner/ or other nerferious software that installs in the background.. If they have zero issues with robbing people, I'm sure they have no issues with releasing garbage hidden software.. buyer beware..
0 Comments Devs sold keys to a bundle site, then ""recalled"" the keys a month later. Without the bundle site, no one even knew what this game was, actually gave it good press... completely sullied the dev name, for this title, and their upcoming (which, I have removed from my wishlist). Good and simple game where you don't have to think too hard.  Good to zone out to. First, I am giving a recommendation as the game has promise in the near future.   What changed for me was the developer actually implemented a patch once feedback was given.  That is very important and i respect that.

Second- Yes this game has bugs and quirks that might make it unplayable at certain points as of today.  I am sure with the bug feedback I am giving, it will be fixed soon.

Its actually not a bad game at all, just a rough start.  If you like sims, and business sims, its worth the $5.",-0.03883071789321793
403640,Dishonored 2,game,False,"11 Nov, 2016",Action,"Reprise your role as a supernatural assassin in Dishonored 2. Declared a ‚Äúmasterpiece‚Äù by Eurogamer and hailed ‚Äúa must-play revenge tale‚Äù by Game Informer, Dishonored 2 is the follow up to Arkane‚Äôs 1st-person action blockbuster &amp; winner of 100+ 'Game of the Year' awards, Dishonored.","my game wont even start up and they are doing nothing  to fix the issue Just like my opinion of Titanfall 2's campaign, Dishonored 2's gameplay itself is good, but despite hearing nothing but praise for the story, I believe the storytelling actually kind of sucks. I suppose this is also a review of Dishonored 1.

For the same reasons of Titanfall 2's campaign, I don't like Dishonored 2's execution of the story. And Dishonored 1 for that matter. Something that I can at least credit the Dishonored franchise for is that everything is more or less set up for success - there's an awesome world, an awesome character, and an awesome premise of enacting bloody justice on a kingdom.

To summarise the same points from my review of Titanfall 2's campaign, I didn't like how the story felt like a picture book - events just happening one after the other, with there apparently being a clear to-do list for the protagonists, apparently knowing exactly what they needed to do in order to take back the throne. Heck, in Dishonored 1, the side characters literally acknowledge that all they did was sit around on their asses and order Corvo to get out there and do the real work. Everything just apparently naturally fell into place; there wasn't any sense of mystery or wonder. Speaking of which, the Outsider in Dishonored 2 seemed to play a more influential role to the characters, compared to Dishonored 1 - which isn't a good thing, considering he was seemingly designed as an omnipotent watcher who gives people strength but not ideas (though I could be wrong on that).

But, unlike Titanfall 2, I actually think the Dishonored franchise having a better setup for a story means the poor execution of the storytelling is a little more disappointing.
Something that Dishonored made itself known for was being able to influence the world and story's outcome depending on how chaotic vs. stealthy or lethal vs. non-lethal you played as. Unfortunately, that meant I sort of couldn't enjoy Dishonored if I did anything other than stealthy and non-lethal. I have to admit, I never played high chaos in Dishonored 1. Simply because I didn't like the idea of the world turning out worse because of it.

I think that's one of the problems of the Dishonored games. While the concept of your actions shaping your player character and also influencing the world around you is cool and all, it's also ironically kind of restricting. It sort of makes the Dishonored world more black and white - your player character either helps keep peace, or contributes to chaos. There's not exactly an in-between.
In Dishonored 1, I frankly came to dislike how the city was already super dead and dying. Every new location looked the same - just another part of a dead and dying city. I was excited to try out Dishonored 2 and experience environments that didn't look post-apocalyptic, but Dishonored 2 sort of introduced a new problem - it attempted to give Corvo a personality.
Giving Corvo a personality isn't exactly a problem by itself, but because there's only low chaos or high chaos, Corvo is only either super pacifist and tolerant, or exaggeratedly cold and ruthless. It's like trying to choose a shade of paint for a house, but there's only blue or red, and no choice for some nice purple - some analogy like that.

I guess attempting to design a game for both stealth and loud aggression will inevitably have issues if it gets incorporated into the lore. But one more issue I have would probably be the game's length - I know it depends on whether you're playing stealthy or loud, but I think the games would be better if there was simply just more content for both stealthy players and chaotic players. Like, for stealthy players, more puzzles and secret solutions and helpful map design, and for chaotic players, more satisfyingly challenging and creativity-rewarding combat scenarios than merely enemies in one area.

One last thing possibly worth mentioning - Emily's existence as a character makes sense for lore purposes, but in gameplay, her powers are probably less easy to use than Corvo's? Like, I feel like there's less synergy between them, and less times that they feel like a natural solution? I don't know. But I'm sure the primary reason they added Emily having powers was because Dishonored 2 was a sequel and they couldn't not introduce new powers. For a similar reason, Corvo having stronger powers than in Dishonored 2, like being able to stop time when preparing Blink, absolutely came from Dishonored 1's Daud DLC and the devs realising they can't remove that for the sequel even if Corvo shouldn't have that power.

But that's a tangent. If there's anything meaningful to draw from that last point, it would probably be, keep your gameplay and lore consistent, otherwise don't bother? I guess. fuck Clockwork Soldiers. Great game addicting Finishing this game left me dissatisfied at one mission rendered me spotted by enemy and game wouldn't tell me which one it was, ruining my stealth run. Still a solid game that has better replayability than the first game despite the worse gameplay feel. Graphics are more old school but the story is solid as are the options, 10/10 Dishonored 2 is clearly an underrated game. A quality immersive sim, the level design allows for many different approaches. The powers are well thought out.

I think the game suffers from some flaws that prevent it from standing out from the crowd, notably:

- A lack of precision in the sound. An enemy can hear us walking even when we are a floor above. It's a shame because it ruins our plans. As far as I know, all stealth games have this issue.
- An AI that does really weird things, like running for no reason. The problem is that it's not predictable.
- The graphics are dull. I can see that there is a real artistic direction, but it is not showcased because everything is gray and plastic-looking. And above all, the environments are full of objects, and since nothing catches the eye, it is sometimes difficult to understand what to interact with. I have often spent 10 minutes looking for an object (a key, for example) when it was right in front of me. It's frustrating. The Void Engine is ugly.
- A story/lore/character that is not very convincing. I didn't understand any of the Outsider's dialogue, and yet he talks a lot... I don't feel attached to the universe.

In short, a game that shines mainly through its gameplay thanks to its level design.

Pretty good game. Yes port is bad. game won't launch
EDIT: After an AMD clean and reset it works

589690,Queen's Quest 3: The End of Dawn,game,False,"27 Apr, 2017","Adventure, Casual",Become a true alchemist!,"This game is more neutral for me but I'm rating it negative purely because it literally tells you the story (through minigames) and yet you cannot and do not do anything about it. You stick to your course as if you had skipped the games. It doesn't let you talk to your best friend, doesn't let you do the things any normal human would do, and has some of the most frustratingly annoying puzzles. It's an alright game, with an alright story and an alright overall setup, but it tries too hard to go for a shock that just isn't there because, once again, they told us this earlier. When it comes down to it, I don't particularly care. And all of that, for $15? Ha. Ha. Haha. No. Good characters and voices in this one, has a Harry Potter vibe with off brand Dumbledore, Snape, and female goth Malfoy. The merchant was very silly and was the star of the game in my opinion, I wish the bonus story was about him instead of the fairies. The fantasy environment in this one has been overdone in most HOGs but the characters really make up for it. Puzzles and HO scenes were all pretty easy, 100%ing the game should be pretty easy for most. Very well done.  Puzzles are simple except for a few which were beyond my meager intelligence.  Scenery was beautiful and fun to look at. Hidden object games were good and somewhat varied. Overall, highly recommend. 



It was okay. Some of the mini-games were ridiculously easy.  Some of the hidden objects were misnamed and/or incorrectly shaped. 
Gameplay 3/5
Style 3/5
Complexity 3/5
Difficulty 3/5
Fun 3/5 This is a game that sh!ts out more dragon crystals than you can ever want or imagine. Cute. Story sucks. Riddles are nice. A third game in the series of Queen's Quest and I have a question...  WHERE is the Queen?!  Or rather...  WHO is/was the QUEEN?!

First game -> The Queen was the MC.  Second -> The Queen was an NPC, but third...  None?  In that case...  This game should be called ""The Chosen One's Quest""...  Minus the three.  I didn't spend too much brain power coming up with that one.

But that's just me picking on it for fun.  The game is fine, just fine.  Long gone are the days where H.O.G. would take you a while to do...  Where a mini game could take all your beautiful brain cells, having you complete it in over 10 min + get an Achievement.  The same Achievement you would feel pride over...

Here...  The puzzles have outlines for ""jigsaw-type"" ones and eh...  Mini-games are simple enough.  Some will take time tinkering with them, but you can do it.

Graphics, everything is beautiful.  Story is nothing new but I like magic and fantasy so that was good and...  Okay, the twist was unexpected.  Just like they got me in the 2nd game.  GOOD.

The Bonus game...  I think most of the time was spent on graphics/designs and they got a bit tired hiding items, so that one isn't too focused on being sneaky/tricky.  Sa right...  It's a Bonus game.  Just something else for you to have fun with.

So not bad, not bad at all and it was enjoyed.  Thank you!  :D =) It may have nothing to do with queen's or royalty in general, and it's also a kind of Dollar Tree Harry Potter rip-off but it's still an enjoyable HOG for the most part. It's certainly way better than the first ""Queen's Quest!""

Story: 3.5/5
I did like the story including the (somewhat predictable) twist, but I felt that it went on for a bit too long and dragged near the end. 

Graphics/Animation: 4/5
Lovely environments and landscapes. Plus, you can sort of pet some bunnies and mice here and there. The character animations are actually not bad but the 3D animation sequences look very clunky.

Voice Acting: 4/5
Good for the most part but some character voices were a little flat

Hidden Object Puzzles: 4.5/5
Plenty of them, and a nice variety of the standard ""find all these items"" and ""find these specific pieces/parts."" I was a little confused by some of the wording at times. i.e. ""Club"" actually was the club symbol you see on playing cards, not a weapon. 

Other Puzzles: 4.5/5
A nice variety of easy and reasonably challenging puzzles. I have to call b.s. on the one ""puzzle"" where you have to find certain branch pieces in a big mess of vines and twigs. 

Music/Sound: 5/5
A very beautiful and epic soundtrack fitting for a fantasy adventure story.

Final Grade: 85% B

Definitely worth buying, although, waiting for a sale isn't a bad idea. great Lazy sequel with very little challenge, and incredibly simple puzzles. Find somethig more interesting to play.",0.1349238520600461

Update 11/20/17:

The latest verison has fixed my complaints- shooters much more intelligently aim for corners and the orientation of your legs is greatly improved- well done! HIghly recommended!

Original review:


Always great to have more co-op style VR games! However, this particular review will strictly focused on the game in terms of it being a goalie simulator in comparison with its natural competitor in this space: Goalie Challenge VR. 

GCVR: Goalie Challenge VR (competition)
GVR: Goalie VR (this game)

Features:

GVR has significantly more depth to it that GCVR- the passing of the puck between players and the ability to create custom plays is great and both unavailable in the stripped-down GCVR. Most notably to me, the replay system in GVR is really great- being able to see exactly how a puck found its way into the net and learning from it is amazing and really makes it feel like a training tool. Finally, it's worth calling out that GVR actually give you virtual arms instead of the floating glove and blocker of GCVR: using your arm to block the puck heading for an upper corner is a very natural movement that is lost in GCVR. (they both give you a virtual torso, of course)

Mechanics:

I grew up in Minnesota and played competitive hockey for ~15 years so I have a good feel for how a hockey game should act mechanics-wise. In short, GVC currently falls short of GCVR in this space. When the players in GCVR wind up and take a shot, it just looks and feels 'right'- as in you can get a good read of the puck right off of their stick in terms of where they are aiming. In GVR, the angle of the stick hitting the puck vs where the puck actually goes seems to be more random- it's much more difficult to get a read right off the stick and just doesn't feel quite right.

On the goalie-side, GVR also struggles to naturally rotate/position the player's legs compared to GCVR. (Of course, GVR supports/will support Vive's strap-on tracker accessories to *perfectly* track legs, but those aren't available commercially yet and they may never be widely owned). The best example of this is when you drop to your knees in a butterfly position on a shot destined for a low corner. As you slightly turn your head to follow the puck into the corner, the game twists your legs to align with your head, thereby exposing the corner where you otherwise would have had your pad down on the ice to make the save. This was the most common way that the AI scored on me- verified by the replay system. This definitely has room for some tweaking so that the leg rotation isn't coupled to your head rotation once the shot is in motion and/or when you're dropped to the ice. GCVR feels much more natural in the balance that it's struck.

Finally, it's worth noting that in my rounds in GVR, the AI almost never seemed to go for the top corners- preferring the lower corners almost exclusively. I went down to my knees for a bunch of shots to try to make the top corners more attractive to the AI, but it still seemed content to just shoot into my butterflied pads instead. GCVR gives you much more variety in save opportunities- which the glove and blocker saves tend to ultimately be the more 'fun' saves to make.

Final notes:

GVR seems to have laid the foundations of a great goalie simulator here, but has some work to do in terms of the pure mechanics. Of course, this is the initial release and I'm confident that they'll continue to tweak things. Still a very fun game to play- especially with the replay system- and, therefore, I'm still recommending this game. However, at this point, I find myself being drawn slightly more to the more bare-bones GCVR if I'm looking for a more realistic-feeling goalie experience. Really looking forward to seeing the next release of this and watching it evolve- it won't take much for this to become the clear choice in the VR goalie-sim space! I bought this on a whim yesterday and have to say I really enjoyed it. I like the asymmetric gameplay between smartphones and VR. I had a lot of fun playing against my kids taking turns being the goalie and taking shots with smartphones.
Only drawback I saw was no iPad support so I didn‚Äôt have enough compatible devices on my first playthough for my family as my wife and I have phones and my kids have tablets. I will try this with a group of friends another night where everybody has their phones to play. Not a lot of substance to it but would be fun to play a few rounds.",0.24255301587301592

 Combo Starting arm, very useful vibes my review 


its a arm ¬≠ A more evasive Gerbera.
The damage, directional Jocky abilities, and charged abilities are identical to the base version.
The GP01's neutral ability replaces the ""push"" of the base version with a vertical Jocky. This propels you into the air from the ground, or straight down if used in the air (up/down Trick from Vergil's DMC4 moveset).
Presumably this makes it less useful for counters, while more useful for outright evasion. Pretty much the only DLC breaker worth having.",0.06785185185185186

711380,Code of Princess EX,game,False,"2 Oct, 2020","Action, Adventure, RPG","Take the role of Princess Solange of DeLuxia as she fights to restore order in a world overrun with monsters. Armed with the legendary sword DeLuxcalibur, Solange gathers a team of fighters, and together they embark on an epic journey to confront the monster uprising and uncover its secret origins.","I don't remember what caught my eye about this game so many years back. It definitely wasn't due to me playing the original 3DS version (I love the 3DS as a system and library). I think it was because it was on my recommended list and I wish listed it. Regardless, I picked it up early 2025 due to it being on sale and needing a quick game to play after beating some longer RPGs. And like Steam's comments at the top of the page, my feelings are very mixed about it. So to be clear this is for the EX edition, not the 3DS / original version.

The story is super straightforward and self-aware. Stop me if you've heard it before: Princess lives charmed life. Princess' castle gets attacked by monsters. Princess draws a holy sword and then has to save her people from saving the land. Along the way, she'll gain 7 followers who support her in her quest. Goofiness clearly occurs as they all play off each other with somewhat humorous effect.

Gameplay is also super forward: it's a beat-em up. And the quickest comparison a lot of folks will probably think of is Guardian Heroes. And it's an apt comparison. You have hard and quick swings, simple ability move sets (sometimes I didn't even know how I pulled some of them off), and 3 different layers to jump between. That's where it stops. The combat is solid, but no where as fast as Guardian Heroes. The plot is fun, but lacks the various choices that took players to different levels and influenced the plot. 

One of the biggest differences is how the game is balanced. Again, I've never played the original. From what I understand, there are 3 main differences that are different from the game's original balance: 1) The reliance on equipment to change stats and combat effects (higher damage to the undead, armored enemies, bosses, lower level enemies). It can lead to some interesting builds. However, due to each character having their own stat progression it tends to be better to play off their strengths. 2) How you accrue burst (think of bursting  as a state that can cause some massive damage). The original built it up based upon combos and damage. This time you start with 3 unless your equipment modifies this. Characters with higher MP stay in that state longer than those with shorter MP bars. 3) The move set has been revamped to make certain attacks more viable such as jump attacks.

Different characters are also more viable than others. I mostly played through the game as Solange (princess) and I was fine with that. Ali, a fast thief character, is also a viable choice. However, Zozo the necromancer completely wrecks opponents and bosses with her magic. Sometimes I felt like the game play was very fair. Other times, it was cheap as I got stun locked and lost a decent amount of health. Recovery items are rarely dropped by opponents. At least the game will give the characters you don't play half experience. There were a few times I needed to grind for 30 minutes to have the levels and gold to buy the necessary equipment to get through certain missions. Locking on to an opponent can help as attacks will then cause some extra damage. The 2 problems with it is that it can go away after a period of time, and you don't get a say who you'll lock onto when there are multiple enemies being hit at the same time. Locking on is also the main way to figure out how much health an enemy has compared to every other beat-em-up.

Musically, the game is fine. There's nothing really offensive about it. The same is true for the sound effects. It's fine when I'm playing it, I have no desire to listen to it beyond that.

If you gave me the choice of playing Guardian Heroes and Code of Princess, I would choose Guardian Heroes. The game is more focused, the overt customization between the 5 characters which changes how they play, and the game is a lot faster. Code of Princess can be fast and the mission based structure shows its 3DS roots. It also makes it super easy to jump in and out of the game. Once you beat a level, you can replay it in extra mode with any of the monsters or characters you've unlocked. So you're getting a fairly good value.

Again, I'd rather Guardian Heroes. After playing a tad more than 7 hours, I'm done. I have no desire to go for any of the achievements. I don't enjoy the combat and equipment system enough to replay levels. At least the game makes skipping cutscenes super easy. I picked this game up for around 5 bucks. I wouldn't pay any more than that to play this game. Or you could go to the Xbox store and pay 5 bucks for the game I've been name dropping a ton throughout this review. So do I recommend this game? Well... I'm mixed about it. Yep, the reviews are right. The definition of a game believing damage sponge enemies is difficulty. If you like Maiden Cops, or Dragon's Crown, this game will be your cup of tea for sure. Try to play it with 4 other people for the best experience possible. The controls are a bit stiff, but there are over 50 playable characters, all which play substantially different from each other, you're certain to find a character you really like to play!

I'd say it's easily worth 20$, it's even better if you can get it on sale. I love this game but this ""remaster"" is terrible with lots of bugs. Please give the original release a go over this one. This was remaster version of Code of Princess, which in this Steam, they have Code of Princess AND Code of Princess EX. The EX version was enhanced/remaster from the original version. The game was port from Nintendo version, so you need to re-configure your game controller if your controller was Xbox/PS version. Trying to move around with any precision is painful.  Pressing left or right should drain your health bar.  It's that painful.  And the translation is terrible, what a hatchet job to an already balls Japanese script.  Bad balls.  There are good balls out there. I really want this game to be good and experience the story line but when I reached a certain boss I just hit a brick wall. I had less problems beating the same bosses in the first Code of Princess game that got released on Steam, so I would say that this game is broken, bugged and no fun to play as soon as you reach that point.
There is another bug where the developers forgot to put a simple loop on the music as well, and I notice it every time when I'm in the shop menu.
So even if the game looks better compared to the first release, I would recommend to stay away from this title. I usually like difficulty games, but this one is pretty stupid, bosses that interrupt your combos out of nowhere, full of invencibility frames and can hit you even when you are behind them.
You can safelly skip it. Be glad someone made a mod for the dub or I wouldn't have touched this lazy port.",0.06644841269841262

Pizza dough:
14 g instant yeast
617g water - 95F
950g all-purpose flour
19g fine sea salt
25g granulated sugar
American Pizza Sauce and Toppings:
1 tablespoon (14g) butter
1 tablespoon (9g) extra virgin olive oil
6 cloves garlic, rough chopped
2 teaspoons (4g) red pepper flakes
28 oz (794g) can of crushed tomato
2 teaspoons (2g) dried oregano
1.5 tablespoons (21g) granulated sugar
salt and pepper to taste
Splash of olive oil
2 cups (227g) low moisture mozzarella, fresh grated
2 cups (200g) Monterey jack cheese, fresh grated
1/2 cup (26g) parmigiano reggiano, fresh grated
American Pizza Dough:
Preheat the oven and a baking steel or pizza stone at 500F for 45 minutes before utilizing it.
Whisk yeast and sugar into your water, and allow it to sit for 5 minutes. In a separate bowl, add flour and salt and mix by hand to combine. Pour your water mixture into your flour and mix by hand until you get a rough dough, then transfer to a work surface and knead until it starts to pull away from the work surface and is relatively smooth.
Place your dough in a greased bowl, then cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 - 2 hours at room temperature or until double in size.
Punch down your dough and dive into 300g pieces. Form those pieces into balls and place them in a floured proofing pizza box, cover with a lid, and proof at room temperature for 3 - 4 hours. (If you do not have a proofing pizza box, you can use a floured baking sheet, cover it with an inverted baking sheet and wrap it in plastic wrap.)
American Pizza Sauce and Toppings:
In a medium sauce pot, add butter and olive oil. Set that over medium-high heat; once the butter melts add garlic, cook until fragrant, add pepper flakes, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic begins to brown on the edges.
Add crushed tomatoes, oregano, salt, and a splotch of olive oil, boil over medium-high, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 12 minutes, stirring occasionally or until thickened and viscous‚Äîseason with salt to taste and let it cool down.
Assembly.- Place one of your pizza doughs onto a floured pizza peel, and flour your dough generously.
Punch your dough down in the center, working your way out to create a ¬º‚Äù wide. Pick up your dough, place it over your closed fists, and rotate it around, gently stretching to 13‚Äù to 14‚Äù.
Place a couple of spoons of your sauce, starting in the center, spreading in little circles, and working your way to the edge until it gets evenly spread out.
In a medium-size mixing bowl, place mozzarella cheese, Monterey Jack, and Parmigiano; mix until combined. Sprinkle your cheese mixture to your desire and place in the oven onto your baking steel and bake for 5 - 7 minutes or until the edge gets golden brown and the cheese melts.

I'd like to say I know exactly what I did, but I mostly solved them moving square by square and testing and getting angry when the angle was almost but not quite right.
Not my most calculating moves. [h3] Achievement Hunting Rating 5/5 [/h3] Solid puzzle game, just not my style. I will still give it the ol' thumbs up despite it not being for my taste in puzzle games because I can very well see it being loved by those that this IS their style. Very challenging but also worth playing, especially if its on sale
 Played on Steam Deck.

Short and sweet. The colors of the two cannons are way too similar not to have a colorblind mode, but for 59 cents I can let it slide. Would be nice to see a bit more polish in a few areas but overall a very nice single-sitting minimalist puzzle game. Mechanics are fine, but the game is not long enough. There are 25 levels which mostly just gradually increase in difficulty until they are really quite challenging. The game level design is fine however there is no ebb and flow to the difficulty like there should be, and the overall length is too short. There could/should be easier levels in between the peak difficulty ones as you progress to give you time to ""breathe"" between challenges, instead of ""congrats, here's one even harder"" each time. Great little puzzle game.  One of those where you spend ages thinking that there's no solution before it finally clicks.  Simple to understand and play and well worth it's low price.

It is only 24 levels so is quite short (took me an hour to complete but would take a casual gamer quite a bit longer I feel) but you can't fault that at it's price point.  Only real complaint I have is that the music auto-plays every time you start and doesn't remember if it was muted previously, but that's nowhere near a big enough issue to label it as a put-off in my opinion. Blokker can be a challenging puzzler. Round 14 took me several minutes to figure it out and I found it the hardest level. Took me about 80 minutes to complete the whole game and I enjoyed every second of it as I like being challenged.

The minimalist concept is a plus in this genre since unnecessary information can be distracting.

I definitely recommend it. Simple, minimalist and good game. Relax, config blocks and see the magic Blokker is an easy & enjoyable minimalist puzzler. Puzzles are basically about lasers and mirrors, but use less intuitive balls and walls instead.

I initially struggled with a few puzzles, but after coming back to the game a few weeks later, I blitzed through the remainder, so I suppose they weren't actually that hard and I just needed some distance from them. Also, puzzles aren't necessarily tight - in a few of the later puzzles, I always had at least 1 block left over. But I think I liked that.

Ultimately, this is a small puzzle game in which puzzles can be solved incrementally. That's good enough for me.",0.07880046583850928

974180,Falnarion Tactics,game,False,"7 Jan, 2019","RPG, Strategy",Falnarion Tactics is an SRPG that is reminiscent of classic Fire Emblem games. Take control of Felm and Momo as they separately lead the group of Shelminai into war alongside the allied kingdoms of Kessania and Inelda against the Garfarian Empire.,"If your into Fire Emblem and looking for something to play then this could possibly be the game for you as it wears it inspiration on its sleeve.
Falnarion tactics see us taking on the role of Felm and Momo who are leading a rebel force against your standard evil empire but there is secret about Felm and Momo which makes them a target as opposed to a nuisance this may lead to fighting against some darker.
Gameplay wise it a very typical tactics title and has all the features you would expect for something inspried by Fire Emblem. The main addition I enjoyed was how easy it was to bring up people to usuable no matter how late you get them in the game by being able to use one of the currencies as XP but as counter point to this due to the speed the story progress and sheer number of characters you get it can be difficult to decide on who to upgrade couple this with splitting the party and randomly removing people (I say randomly but it due to story reasons) it can very frustrating investing in a character to either not use them for a few mission or straight up never getting to use them again, this makes the side quest character very important as they are always with you.

Overall I found its little frustrating from losing characters to just how many people have something yet nothing to say and because of this you don't really get to know most of the characters properly. If you have a fire emblem sized whole to fill you get some enjoyment from this but beyond that I couldn't recommend it further This isn't a particularly good game, but I find it fun to speedrun at least. 

The game's sense of balance seems to be ""let's throw huge waves of enemies at the player and have them go crazy."" It can be fun, in a stupid way. This game is a blast to play, very addictive and definitely scratches that ""one more round"" itch. The story is interesting, the battles are thrilling + require tactics, and the level-ups and party management are in-depth. For the price this a wonderful little gem of a game. Strong recommend.      A very good fire emblem clone.  There will always be room for improvement, but it scratches that turn-based itch that is so hard to scratch these days with real time bullshot put out by the big companies.  I will be buying the other games in this series; both because they are fun and also to support this type of developer.  Thank you for some decent turn based games with soul. Its a decent game. If you like classic turn-based Strategy games like Fire Emblem or Advanced Wars then you will enjoy this. I recommend this title...with conditions. It has a strong Shinning Force vibe to it. The feeling of leveling your troops with limited resources makes it feel very well paced. The story is typical, basic ""Good"" rebels vs. ""Evil"" empire. It has been worth the cup of coffee it costs. With that said...
It isn't very original, like it was was made by a group of teens, with RPG maker. Maybe it was, I don't know anything about the devs. Also, I have a very modern computer. While this runs fine, it will just randomly glitch and freeze. This has happened about once every hour. Luckily, you can save often so its not much of an impeding factor. 
There is a ""sidequest"" menu where you play battles to get loot and companions. They also give you points for extra loot in the main campaign menu. I am not sure how needed it is to do, maybe you can ignore these and speed through the plot, I dont know. Maybe its to flush the game out.
I will end saying that I enjoy the battle mechanics, simple enough to hit the ground running, but each character has unique abilities. So each mission you want to look around before you start for a plan of attack. I will venture to finish the story. There are some ""unlockables"" on the main page. I have  seen a whole lot worse here on Steam, I would buy for a friend who is interested
 It's not the grandest or deepest tactics game but it's solid and I enjoyed it. In some ways, Falnarion Tactics feels like the most modern and fully-featured SRPG Studio game I've yet played, but its maps packed full of dozens upon dozens of enemies, often standing shoulder to shoulder, often opposing just as many NPC allies of yours, combined with a questionable story and very strange balance decisions, made it actually the least fun commercial one I've yet played.

On the bright side, it makes use of more SRPG Studio features than most, with a huge variety of equipment, two currencies, one of which can be used to buy levels for characters directly, a lot of side missions that you can do in between story missions, and a huge variety of playable characters. It's also by far the longest SRPG Studio game I've played, with Steam saying I spent 22 hours on it, and my final save file time being just under 15 hours. 

The story also ... well. It's another Team Syukino game, and you can really tell. A lot of very epic things happen, frequently with little buildup, so people will be joining your team and leaving constantly because they suddenly died, turned against you, or any other reason you can imagine. With only 11 or so actual story stages, the main story is just not long enough to make me care about most of the cast, either, so I pretty much just shrugged when anyone other than the main duo of Felm and Momo became unavailable, except if it was someone who had good stats. (This can also be a bit of a mechanical gripe, as well - you can invest a lot of stuff in characters who then become permanently unavailable. While some of it isn't so bad because you can just clean out their inventory when they're about to leave, bonus points and permanent boost items are lost forever.)

On the dim side, battles against dozens and dozens of enemies can be quite tedious, with a good handful of stages featuring over 100 enemies. Ones where you have dozens and dozens of allies on top of this change it up somewhat, but either you use the fast-forward feature and only get to see the aftermath of all the fighting, or you spend a lot of time watching characters not under your control hit each other. The game balance is also pretty bad, with some characters maxing out with frankly pathetic stats - Norma, for me, never even hit 15 in a single stat other than HP - while others will have 15 in their worst stat and the others mostly around 30. Thankfully, the abundance of revival items means that you can just throw everyone into the meat grinder and revive all the dead people, but the feeling that some characters are never going to contribute anything except taking a fall still remained.

Likewise, while there's a huge variety of weapons and other equipment available, the dev made the strange choice of limiting how many are ever available in the shop, so there end up being a limited number of good - or even tolerable - weapons throughout the entire game. In addition, durability is very low, with almost nothing have more than 20 uses, and many having as few as 10. (Healing staves are hilariously worse, with only 3 uses.) Given the length of the game and the sheer amount of enemies, this definitely contributed strongly to my frustrations with Falnarion Tactics, because I had to spend a lot of time managing people's inventories for the current deployment.

Ultimately, I don't recommend Falnarion Tactics simply because I had more frustration than fun playing through it. In some ways it's the best commercial SRPG Studio game I've played so far, but not in the crucial way of actually being a good game to play. It's fun and retro but not too stuck in the past. 

It really plays like fire emblem and Shinning Force. Love it Still very early in the game but I quite like it thus far, have never had the ability to play any Fire Emblem games but love watching/reading LP's of them so running across this had me very interested. Overall it seems to be a pretty faithful FE style of game, though it does have some annoying bits.

I think my biggest worry is the low durability on healing items, makes sense for the cure root but really wish the healing staffs had maybe 10 uses instead of 3. The weapons at least have good numbers of uses. I'm sure the healing issue alleviates some as the game progresses though and the heroes grow stronger (my Felm is already quite Tanky which is nice to see in the Lord character)

The UI is a bit awkward as well, took me a couple minutes of looking at the level up screen to be certain I understood which stats had leveled. Would be nice if moving things between characters and the convoy was a bit smoother too, can see that potentially getting even more time consuming as I gain more people.

Would be really good to have some graphical indication of which buildings on a map are visitable too, Can get a bit hectic trying to balance checking each building for an interaction option with keeping my formation intact.

All in all, while it could be a better game, yes, it works and it functions in all the ways I would expect from a FE style of game. Certainly looking forward to continuing to tackle the initial batch of side quests for more gear and people and then seeing what the next tidbit of story throws at me.",0.060772438007461016

This is an indie developed 2.5D side scrolling shooter with poor optimization.

You also cannot access the options menu while playing and have to exit back to the main menu to access the options. There is also no manual save and checkpoints are sort of far away. The camera angle is also locked with some awkward auto-turning and bodies immediately disappear after killing enemies. The worst aspect however in my opinion is aiming with weapons. Aiming is extremely awkward and I was constantly getting killed because I could not aim to where it would hit the enemies. In fact, I consider the game basically unplayable due to how atrocious aiming is. Overall, the entire experience looks and feels like an amateur school project to me.

Howard discovers that his own terrible past has some connection to the madness that is about to swallow him, yet again.","Its an alright horror game, but you almost need a magnifying glass to read the notes in this game Crashed I played this right after the first part which i like and it was a bit disappointing. Story sometimes feels like 
forcibly done because must do part 2 and are boring/not good and cliche.
Inventory etc. interface is very bad to use effectively and sound acting very poor. Game is very buggy too sometimes i fall outside of the game world and when Henry needs translate the book my character don`t mention anything that it needs to cipher even if it should have after i opened book and because of that i fear that game breaks but luckily loading save game couple of times and trying many many times i get it work. 
Some levels are boring and puzzles all not that good. Maybe 5/10 if you played first part and liked it and are curious how does the story progress from there i can recommended check out but this not very good game so little bit disappoint after first one and sometimes very boring. Well, this is a game.  I was expecting a sequel to the first one and I got...more of the first one cranked up.  The atmosphere is more, the controls are more, the puzzle difficulty is more.

I like this game.  While the first game tested my patience with the document system and clues in ""order"".  This game is more straight-forward and more BS.  Item interaction triggers can be a single pixel wide.  Acting required objects upon each other sometimes do not trigger resulting actions.  Logic has gone on holiday.  (I need to light up phosphorescent paint?  Cool!  Flashlights won't work but a camera flash will?  WTF?)

Over, this is a good sequel.  I liked the coherent story that you uncover and the cameo from the first game.

8 hours to finish carefully the first playthrough.  Another 2 hours for achievement hunting.

Overall rating:  7/10  (No shame for walkthroughs.) i really like the story of that game its just need a remaster.. Kept getting thrown off the map with no input whatsoever. As expected, the sequel to 'DW: In Pursuit Of Loath Nolder' is a Lovecraftian mystery adventure puzzler with horror elements. If you liked the first one, you will definitely like this one too, although there are differences and the original felt a tad superior overall. Basic difference is that this wasn't made in the classic point-and-click style, but instead you can roam around freely, which to me is a plus (but does cost a bit in terms of game performance).

[h3]PROS[/h3]
+++ Will definitely scratch the 'Painscreek Killings' itch, with a good amount of buildings to explore at your leisure
+++ You can save manually at any time and there are (literally) 100 available slots
+++ Multiple endings [spoiler] plus a secret non-ending (you will get it when you get there) [/spoiler]
+++ You can twitch the video, audio and gameplay settings to your liking
+++ Fast travel options for every available place (as long as you've been to said place at least once before)
+++ Same underlining mechanic as in the original, but more user-friendly
++ Has a pretty good atmosphere on its own, but a bit lacking if you (inevitably) compare it to the first game
++ The story is a direct link to the original and it comes to a conclusion. It is a bit whacky, but it's what you would expect considering what the previous game was about
++ Nice audio and sounds effects
++ Difficulty options and hint system available
+ Serviceable graphics
+ Passable use of physics

[h3]CONS[/h3]
- Puzzles are generally easier compared to the first game, but some are still pretty obscure and will most likely require a guide or a lot of your time
-- Interacting with items can be problematic at times. For example, smaller items aren‚Äôt always highlighted despite you having your cursor right on them
-- Too many clues just sit in your inventory, but very few of them are really useful and can actually be combined, which can be quite confusing
-- Too much dialogue at times, that -considering the already obscure sci-fi horror theme- can get tiring
-- The free walking around instead of the point-and-click style has its toll performance wise, fps drops are frequent especially in big open areas
-- Voice acting is pretty inferior to that of the first game (which I found excellent)
--- Pretty buggy - Make sure to save often and try not to go to places that you are obviously not supposed to go (or be prepared to no clip into oblivion, thus having to restart your game) - That said, if you stay on the obvious path you will be ok like 99% of the time

[h3]CONCLUSION[/h3]
Easy recommendation, especially for fans of the first DW game. Price-to-content ratio feels more than fair, as you will spend a good amount of your time roaming the available places, figuring out the puzzles and learning more and more of the story and lore as you go along. Despite being an old game (and it shows in various aspects), it‚Äôs still a more than decent mystery puzzler and imho a must for Lovecraft fans.
 A couple of strange game behaviors, but a walkthrough helped.  Otherwise, a very good 3-D, horror adventure puzzle game. Sadly i couldn't even make it out of the book store, super buggy and for a strange reason it would not save my progress so i had to start from the beginning. I tired 3 more times but same thing so i gave up. the story seem interesting tho, its a shame i cannot start or finish the game :(   Save your dollars and pass on this game. Story felt much easier to follow then the first, I also learned to slow down and really check everything for puzzles.",0.09850239208729775

+Gun visuals are nice

 I will flesh out this review over time. 

HOWEVER, PLEASE KEEP IN MIND: 

You get what you pay for.

This game is CHEAP for a reason...

PROS:
-Innovative Difficulty System. This was neat. I enjoyed watching my difficulty level go up as I played the game.
-Several weapon choices to choose from. This was also quite neat.
-Fresh spawns of enemies frequently. This keeps me busy.

CONS:
-This isn't flashy at all. This is simple, elementary gameplay.
-There is... Quite honestly... Only one type of enemy.
-The game is beaten extraordinarily fast. There is little to no replay value.
-Several things are NOT explained in the game. This is bad.
-The music you hear in the trailer? Yeah... That's not in the game.

Essentially, you are a... Human? With an arsenal of weaponry. You're trying to kill the Alien Race. This is nothing special. Nothing spectacular. There is no such thing as a ""Story"" in this game. Period.

The weaponry is basic and nearly everything is the same. It's nothing to gawk over. Different fire rates... Different power levels... But essentially the same weapon.

This game will be beaten once, then probably never played again, unless you thoroughly enjoy this type of game.

Overall.... 6-7/10, but ONLY for the price it is listed at. I can probably milk an hour, hour and half out of this game. I highly doubt I will get much more.

EDIT: This game is currently experiencing crashes. I'll update my review at a later time when these crashes are no longer persistent. Unfortunately, I will need to change my ""Recommend"" to a ""Negative"" Due to this aspect hindering gameplay. Beat it in 20 minutes. The ""campaign"" is about 10 levels. But you can't even do the campaign until you play ""battle"" mode a dozen times, which is the game's way of making sure you know the game before you take on the campaign. Not worth even on sale for $3.50. Maybe 0.99 cents it would be worth.
Koya Rift has a a bug where everytime you access the weapon color details page it crashes when you exit it.

The only thing that would extend this game would be to have more upgrades for your character and with that an endless survival mode. Other than that, the maps may be random but certainly not ""procedurally generated"" as the trailer boasts.",-0.030674019607843134

You will face true fear in a way you had never thought possible.","The game is a little short and not really a game in the sense of having to figure out things. The game directs you towards where you need to go. Good usage of sounds/ music. Some cheap jumpscares, but also some really unexpected ones. Bought it in a package deal and was worth its money. for me this is first game got me scared love it It is a short experience and it could be actually good. There is a poor implementation of controls, view related only, which made me a bit motion sickened. However i could play through the game and beat it with no real issues on my Oculus Quest and am looking forward to play the next chapters. I got this whilst it was on a sale. I experienced all 3 from the trilogy. This one had a good atmosphere and probably was one of the scariest out of the three, however the third one also had a good atmosphere. Get it whilst it is on sale to support the people that made it, despite it is not the scariest of VR experiences, one of the less scary ones in my taste. Rise of Insanity in VR was much more scary at times and it is longer, for it is a game. Exorcist: Legion VR is what you want to experience to experience proper VR horror. I haven't yet, I am hoping for a sale, but if there is no sale, I will get the lot from Legion. As for this, I recommend it as an experience, put it in your wishlist and wait for the sell. A bit short. A bit rough around the edges, but it still has some moments I enjoyed. I wish you could move in the direction of the controller. Though using the thumb pad is always my preferred method of movement, the movement does not feel consistent, like it's not always moving at the same rate, and it would be nice if using the trigger while walking, sped things up a bit. Overall a bit weak, but still creepy fun. This game is short but i really enjoyed it. sure its wonky. I was never a big fan of horror games up until I bought my Vive. I got a bunch of horror games because there just wasn't that many VR things to experience. WOW! did I get sucked in to horror games and experiences. Sure most of them are super short. If I can make it through with no crashes I'm willing to overlook alot. This game is short but it scared me a few times. It's really creepy. Price is high at 6 bucks for 20 minutes or so but I feel like I got my money's worth. Sure it's not long & the graphics aren't eye popping & also the controls are a little weird but I really enjoyed myself. Just keep expectations low & you might be surprised at this one. I've definitely seen a lot worse. LOL, I know it isn't the best recommendation but it scared me, its creepy and game didnt crash & its only 6 bucks Pretty bad game. I thought the pictures looked good, so I decided to ignore the reviews and buy the game. The graphics are bad, movement is bad, gameplay is bad. It's a bunch of jump scares as you walk through a VERY guided path. Really not fun at all. One of the best Vr Horror experience i had until now ...Amazing game ..... It had a few unique jumpscares which I enjoyed...but it's over in 19mns. I enjoy seeing what people come up with in this new vr era. Horror is a big draw for developers because  if done right it can be  really scary like no way before.  This is short but I found it to be really heart stopping at times.  Nothing special but worth the cheap price.  I used a gamepad with Oculus and had no issues.  Be sure to look everywhere .  Events get triggered, so if your stopped in your tracks by the game look around.  2 Newer games in the series I'll be playing.

Help Iko adventure across beautiful hand-painted islands, receive letters from a quirky cast of characters, and face powerful monstrous adversaries.","I absolutely love this game, super fun platforming with a cute story and combat that's satisfying without feeling too repetitive or frustrating. 10/10! short, simple and satisfying Last year I played Crypt Custodian (another game by Kyle Thompson), and thought it was an enjoyable if basic adventure. After playing Islets, I can sense a running theme. Islets ticks a lot of the boxes most good Metroidvanias should have. Solid progression, fast movement, lots of fun boss fights, and a big world to wander about in. It's a very solid and well made Metroidvania that fans of the genre will sink right into.

However, I feel Islets lacks... anything more really. The characters and world are not especially interesting, and most of the unique mechanics this game does explore are not developed enough to see their full potential. It almost feels as though the game is afraid to get a little weird and clunky. I think there are glimmers of genius here and there, but never anything more. Again, I still had a fun time with Islets. It's a good game and probably worth your time, but I wouldn't go into the game expecting it to shake up what a game like this can be. I finished Islets! What a great game. It's a fun, fairly chill metroidvania that gives me big Hollow Knight vibes - but much easier. It's lacking a final coat of polish, and you can kinda tell that it's from one dev, but don't let that take away from the accomplishment. I fully believe it's worth playing, especially if you get it on sale for $13. It's cute, the writing is fun, the mechanics are solid, everything moves quickly enough to keep your interest, it encourages exploration while staying somewhat linear and without requiring needless backtracking, I had a great time playing it. I got 42/44 achievements in 14.4h, this includes beating the boss rush mode once.

Now my biggest gripe. Maybe this is just me, but seeing it sitting at 42/44 achievements grinds my gears. The last two achievements are for beating the boss rush on hard, and beating it without dying. Which is cool and all, but boss rush takes away all your powerups and doles them out on a boss by boss basis - so you know all those abilities you gained and moves you learned? You gotta start without them. So the boss rush is even harder than when playing them in game. On the other hand, you get unlimited lives/retries, but it just feels like a slogfest more than a fun post-game mode. It took me over an hour to complete the boss rush on normal. Sure, I'd do better next time, and I won't pretend to be the world's greatest gamer, I really don't want to do it again on hard. I've heard you can savescum the ""no death"" run but that sounds even more tedious. Ugh.

But, well, that's my biggest complaint. Getting the last two achievements in a post-game mode. The actual game is great. If you're looking for a relatively short, cute, chill metroidvania I strongly recommend it, and I'm really looking forward to playing the devs newer games! Very fun little metriodvania. Some new features and was not too difficult. played it through in 12 hours. I definatly got my moneys worth. Great metroidvania, some abilities are really unusual. Character is swift, and feel nice to control. Bosses are fun, and mystically took me roughly 15 attempts each (on hard), which is exactly the right amount for me: you need to git gut, but no need to start throwing things in frustration. I loved it. 
The boss rush mode is cruel, since it doesn't use the same build you made while playing, I really wanted to annihilate earlier bosses with my mighty late game Iko) i am worlds #1 GreyBird fan of all time Doesn't do anything new and exciting but what's there is polished and lots of fun. simple but so much fun
 This is a cozy metroidvania which is similar to Yoku's Island and Guacamelee 1+2. Islet stands out from its peers by being very chill and laid-back, and its humor is also what makes it stand out (and very chill music). Just remember, if you are a metroidvania fan, don't expect to be longer than average metroidvania length, which usually ranges from 10 - 20 hours. That being said, it is an easy and quality game I recommend it to players both new or familiar with the genre.",0.10951641854080879
543950,Z`code (VR for HTC Vive),game,False,"8 Nov, 2016","Indie, Simulation",&quot;Z'code is a First-Person Mech Fighting game in VR. Players will simulate driving armor in the fight on Earth.&quot;,"I HATE TO DO IT BUT DONT GET IT YET, IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE GREAT, BUT AS IS IT MADE ME VOMIT, NO JOKE LITERALLY UPCHUCKED AFTER PLAYING THIS GAME, I DONT USUALLY HAVE ISSUES WITH IT AS I HAVE STRONG VR LEGS. BUT THIS ONE NEEDS TO BOB FROM SIDE TO SIDE AS IT STEPS AND HEAR LOUD FOOT STEPS. IT GLIDES RIGHT NOW AND THATS WHAT MADE ME SICK I wanted a mech game so I decided to try this game. With no reviews other than just negative votes, I felt I would step in for a text review. The review will be broken up into sections with ""----"".

----
You aim with your head and the controls seem standard enough. 
Left Controller
1) Trackpad : Movement
2) Trigger : Weapon Switch
Right Controller
1) Trackpad : Boost
2) Trigger : Fire Weapons

Movement is not teleporting as you're in a mech. Standard left controller trackpad movement is sliding at a steady speed. It is done by holding your thumb over the direction you wish to go, so there is no need to hold the trackpad down. I am a victim of motion sickness in some games with sliding movement, but not in this. I actually like the movement in Z'Code. Movement isn't to fast or slow so it works great. However, boosting might throw you for a loop with no trackpad experience,

----
Graphics are fair and I didn't have to many game performance issues. I did however notice a small dip in FPS in two areas of the game on a GTX 970. None of which were game breaking

----
Game Modes
1) Easy
2) Medium
3) Hard

I have only played easy & for whatever reason after finishing it, neither medium or hard unlocked. What's worse is you top it off with a language barrier for some people. If you can't read Mandarin Chinese you are out of luck. When you click on a locked game mode there is no English explanation.

----
AI isn't wonderful. I can slightly excuse this, but it needs to be pointed out. Once in the tracked distance of the AI they'll just open fire in a sort of straight path. Shots are very easy to avoid. This could be different in higher game modes, but as explained above I couldn't play higher than Easy.

-----
Game dialogue isn't voice acted. While playing a lady starts talking in large boxes of text in the bottom left corner of your cockpit. These mission messages disappear very quickly. Unless you are a speed reader and/or can keep the Vive in that sweat spot to read text you'll be missing a majority of what is said.

----
Weapons

Standard Weapons: 
1) Chain Guns/Rail Guns/Machine Guns : Take you pick in name. It's just a quick shooting gun.
2) Blaster/Energy Gun : A single round ball comes out both guns on your mech.

Power Up
1) Missles : Once you get enough energy these take over your standard weapon. You have little control over them as they simi-seek out enemies.

Special Weapons (This is the ones I remember and/or only got to see in ""Easy"". These are dropped randomly on enemy kills).
1) Power Blaster : Stronger than the normal standard blaster. Yet limited in ammo & honestly not to great.
2) Power Chain Gun: Again better than the standard one. Better amount of ammo than the Blaster, but some what effective.
3) Lasers : These seem very over powered. You shoot two beams out your mech to mow down a number of enemies like it was nothing. In fact, the final boss in this game can be destroyed with them. I happened to pick lasers up after one of the swarm of enemies before the final boss. I killed the boss in a matter of seconds with lasers. It made it literally no challenge at all.

----
Game Length is very short on Easy. I can't comment on medium or hard as stated before it wouldn't unlock. I finished this game in around 0.3hrs Steam time, or in other words about 18 minutes. For how short this game is & the slight issues I can't recommend this game for that alone.

Achievements seem to be broken. It's no biggy to myself, but it seems the old chivo's are broken, so achievement grinders want be happy.",-0.0038676447009780438

Had this on PS1 os a kid. Randomly seen a video of a fella ragging on games, this one included, and then MEMORY UNLOCKED. Finally knowing the name, I found this and did what I couldn't at 3. Like beating it. What I like? It is untouched from what I can tell. Seems like a game stuck in the mid 90s. What I don't like? Man, I must've been a dumb kid to not figure this out... Kinda checks out for how the last 25 years or so have gone... 10/10 for the time capsule/nostalgia kick. ¬´Pajama Sam 3¬ª ‚Äî is the third installment in the beloved children's adventure game series by ¬´Humongous Entertainment¬ª, but unfortunately, it feels weaker compared to its predecessors.

Story and Atmosphere:
This time, Sam finds himself in a world of sentient food, where a conflict is brewing between different groups of edible characters. His mission is to help organize a peaceful conference.
In this world, food is self-aware, talks, and interacts, yet casually discusses its own fate in the food chain. The storyline feels mediocre, as if it was pulled out of thin air.

Gameplay and Puzzles:
The gameplay stays true to the series‚Äô traditions‚Äîexploring locations, collecting items, and using them in the right places. However, the puzzles seem simpler and less inventive than before.

Conclusion:
¬´Pajama Sam 3¬ª ‚Äî feels less well-thought-out and engaging than the previous games in the series. amazing game, literally no complaints, very fun and chill I remember playing the demo as a kid. The CD was from a cereal box. Good times. Game still holds up, good for kids. This game is good for a younger audience. I grew up playing the collection now I get to experience these games again with my own children, 10/10 wish they made Kids games like this again. BABAGA-BOOSH!

It even gave me new perspective on media consumption, how creators view their works, how they don't, and how it can all just be in our hands sometimes. I'll remember it for a long time to come.
Good stuff. I'm not holding out on a sequel happening at this point but the proposed ideas were awesome, I'd read that if it came to fruition Ambre Bonus Booklet, is very good as it delves deep into the inspiration and creation ofthe game and I liked how some of the theories I had about the game‚Äôs inspiration I talked about in my review were confirmed. Also I liked there are hints of a possible sequel which I really hope is made someday. While this booklet isn't free like the soundtrack I do recommend getting it, as it gives good insight into the game and it also supports the creator.

750710,CRONEWORLD RPG ADVENTURE - 1,game,False,"4 Dec, 2017","Indie, RPG","CRONEWORLD is a fantasy-story telling rpg indie game. It is a game about humans fighting wizards with flying robot 'CRONES'. It's world has Eastern culture, Western culture, science fiction and magics.","This game is a sin against god. [h1]TL;DR:[/h1] There's seemingly a fairly appealing JRPG (this one is Korean, btw) beneath all the weird presentation peculiarities - like the cumbersome interface design and the unorthodox way the game runs and plays from a tech standpoint. Definitely not for everyone. Suggested for the technically inclined and geekily adventurous gamer, perhaps of the older crowd, who would not be averse to enduring some technical hurdles and the uncoordinated confusion (gameplay-wise) that is at least the initial part of the game as the player is getting up to speed with game mechanics.

[h1]In more detail:[/h1] Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Nah... Looks like a port. Or is it? The game plays by launching an HTML file in a self-contained browser. You can't get rid of the address bar even in Full Screen (F4). If you're after the episode intro [url=www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPvFM2Zqi0U]FMVs[/url], the game outsources to your regular browser and directs you to a YouTube video (that's some serious indie right there). The whole game is perhaps a big old Flash object or something? I wasn't in the mood to investigate, though, especially after exiting the application after which it covertly remained running, leaving no process behind to manually terminate. A good thing I caught on early - had to resort to restarting Steam, and it then turned out the game'd been racking up playtime while being in this limbo state.

The game itself is your standard lighthearted techno fantasy about some bad blood happening between wizards (humans with elf ears) and regular humans, with locations boasting a potpourri of architecture styles from medieval to early industrial and beyond - that doesn't mean gigantic airborne aircraf... I mean, CRONE carriers are out of the question, though. There's magic (or maybe just sufficiently advanced technology). Almost everyone owns an exosuit called a ""crone"" - unlike the hulking behemoths of BattleTech, these are of the smaller variety, a few meters tall, like a Heavy Gear from a less known Activision franchise. The crones don't look gritty and menacing - on the contrary, most are cute & colorful, like Pokemon. The pilots appear to be mostly the requisite teens and junior high students. There are supernatural flying talking tigers and dragons. A sinister rampant AI (or a collective thereof) is scheming, bent on eradicating humans. I wish I could enjoy the story further... Technical and gameplay design issues beset the gameplay as well - there is some minimal tutorial in the beginning, but certain things just happen too fast without explanation. E.g., in the first location, some giant monsters attack the town and there are alerts flashing up top that you're supposed to react to, yet the game seems to be running a lot faster than intended, an issue that some very old games sometimes exhibited when running on newer computers and operating systems. Some fights you initially get into, a few crone sparring matches, are over in a couple seconds, with battle stats or what's happening almost beyond perception - you are only apprised of the result when the fight is over. Oh, and there's an in-game clock, with one in-game hour clocking in around 20 real seconds or so. Some tasks later on are therefore likely to be timed - e.g. in one of the first few quests you're supposed to pick up a delivery after some specified hour. This instills a sense of urgency that's compounded by the fact that the animations are faster than originally designed. A player new to the game can't help but feel rushed, yet there is little direction or explanation.

Btw, a funny thing... The word ""crone"" being thrown around so much is unintenionally risible to the Western sensibilities - it almost begins to sound like homely irate old ladies are the centerpiece of this story.

[h1]My take:[/h1] I wouldn't mind tinkering with a technically challenging piece of work like this back in the day, but as it stands now, being somewhat strained for time, I'm opting to pass on this one. However, there seems to be a compelling story and a curious RPG system (the Crones even have various emotion levels) beneath the hood - if only all of it were more accessible to the casual gamer... Still voting up, I like the aesthetics of this Crone World and the story is alright, insofar as I could pick up from the in-game intro and the accompanying FMVs on YouTube.",0.013302188552188548
2450690,PAYDAY 3: Syntax Error Heist,dlc,False,"12 Dec, 2023","Action, RPG","The Payday Gang tackles a heist on tech giant Scry Digital, an industry leader in AI technology.","Idk why are people hating on this dlc. It is great and fun. You should buy this dlc in my opinion. Ofc houston breakout is better but it is still good its aight You spend time & do entire heist without seen carry all the bags just outside to get seen by all of those civs again so that you carry all bags down again to explode some wall to outside again for helli is quite bad design in my opinion,
Entire game is about heist, not carrying bags thru entire map.PD2 had same issues in some maps but this is not Payday2
I expected some changes in this direction but some things are kept same this is not nostalgic... it's just pain in the arse.

Out of 4 payed expension this is the only lame one even there is new enemy type etc. Replayibility of the map is all the worst everything is on the same place. I would say only buy this one with year expension or if its %50 off discount. Payday 3 is objectively worse than Payday 2. I will change my review when Payday 3 is at least as good as Payday 2.

If you care about Payday 3, then force Starbreeze to make it better by leaving a negative review to impact their sales.

Payday 3's issues since Day 1:

Barely any heists
- We have only 16 (10 at launch) short heists with little replayability
- Very little RNG elements in heists, especially non-dlc heists
- Why can't we have Payday 2 level variety on how to complete heists (multiple escapes/breaches)?
- Payday 2 has over 70 heists

No Multiday Heists
- Payday 3 should have been released with at least 30 heists, 10 being multi-day

Most heists are short
- I can solo most in under 12 mins on the hardest difficulty easily

Live Service only
- Even Solo mode requires a ping before and after the game, often failing
- Matchmaking was terrible, became bad and is terrible again now with crimenet
- Want to host a lobby? Get ready to wait several minutes...
- random disconnections, single lost network packet can disconnect you
- 150ms lag feels like 600ms lag in any normal game
- 5 min heist loading
- UI freezes when loading, sometimes infinite
- long loading if 1 player has bad internet
- Sometimes instant disconnection after joining a lobby
- Still have the can't ready up bug sometimes

Obvious game breaking bugs take forever to fix:
- Cook off has had crashing issues since launch
- Cook off escape van IS STILL BROKEN since 9 months ago (maybe fixed today)
- Diamond District stuck door
- Invisible enemies
- Countless stuck objectives
- UE4 is a decade old and very stable, bad Starbreeze code crashing game
- It feels like little to no QA is done before releasing and update
- Forget PD2 hotfixes, never had any

No heists with large maps
- At least a 5/30 should be large maps

Few interesting heists
- No real creativity for the jobs the gang does
- Execution (ie drilling/hacking) is also pretty boring
- Why are there still wifi circles after a whole year???

No Preplanning
- Can only order basic assets without placing them

Many missing PD2 mechanics like driving

AI teammates are stupid
- Cannot be instructed to wait and don't help with objectives
- Sometimes don't even revive you if you are downed
- Often broken/stuck (Fear & Greed)
- Cannot have their loadouts, weapons or skills changed

Enemies are bland
- Crowds of bullet sponge swat that do little damage to players
- Only new special is the Nader (who was broken for most of this year)
- Tasers are now called Zappers and are barely a threat
- Only one variant of Bulldozer with an auto-shotgun
- Bulldozers can only target a single player and are slow to retarget

Cloakers are too buggy
- Attack through walls/corners
- Always target players even if you're the last one
- Can't be heard that well (were silent most of this year)
- Can only be stopped by a one shot kill when they close charge you
- Spawn from the same closest location every wave end so are easy to expect

Heisters to play as are lacking
- Only 7 playable heisters, PD2 has 22
- Voicelines are bland and few
- Barely any situational voicelines and no banter between heisters

Skills are super bland and boring
- No drill skills, Inspire, Joker, Pistol Messiah or any interesting skills for that matter
- I personally hate the new Armor plate economy, PD2 armor was perfect
- No perk decks to make cool builds
- No infamy system/rewards
- Too easy to become 150, other players' renown levels hidden
- Edge, Grit, Rush effects are an unnoticeable 10%

Music is acceptable but worse than PD2
- Only dlc heists have good music + Diamond District
- No ability to change heists' music
- No access to PD2/PDTH soundtrack

The UI is still bad
- No number stats of weapons in UI, have to look these up online
- Can't move guns around/sell preset guns
- Weapons have same inventory icon regardless of which mods/skins are on it
- Way too many large buttons/text which lead to unnecessary sub-pages and submenus
- Can't manage party/other players directly from main menu/esc screen
- No value of items shown when grabbed/secured
- Separate control for marking than interacting unlike PD2
- Kicked to main menu after heist (can opt-in and wait 60s to form party which nobody does)

Few weapons
- No melee weapons at all
- No saw
- Very few guns and the meta ones are all DLC
- Same high fire rate and one shot kill weapons used for Overkill
- No weapon lasers nor flashlights
- Weapon sights cannot have the reticle changed at all
- Secondary weapons all crazy suck except for DLC ones since Houston Breakout
- No exciting weapons like Flamethrower, RPG or medieval weapons
- Since day 1 we've begged to get rid of the OVK weapon system
- No weapon skins that allow you to freely change mods

Few Throwables
- Grenade barely does any damage
- No cool throwables except the shock grenade
- Only get 2 knives which break when hitting a wall

Few achievements:
- Despite the little content, there should still be more achievements

Equipment sucks
- Ecms are now useless, except disabling one camera you can reach
- Infrasonic mines that you manually detonate to temporarily stun instead of tripmines
- No c4
- Sentries are now a deployable so nobody uses them over Armor Bags

Few masks
- Most masks are overdone and feel too ridiculous to ever wear
- Very few patterns to choose from
- Preset masks cannot be customized
- No interesting materials

No Deathwish
- Overkill is way too easy, never had to first play other difficulties
- FBI van is stupid easy

Modifiers can't be changed
- For the last few months, almost every heist has the 2 specials and blinding shield modifiers
- I would like to enable all of them for more pay, they can't be changed

Pros over PD2 (this is why I would accept at least 30 heists vs PD2's 70 at launch)
+ Graphics gorgeous compared to PD2 but very unoptimized (ppl with 4080s are getting lag spikes)
+ Mask off stealth has more depth but now stealthing is way too easy
+ More heists with code locks which are cool to guess
+ Hostage system is better
+ Final Wave mechanic to make securing all loot harder
+ Fixed Naders are a cool threat
+ Bulldozers can melee kick and charge players
+ Cool animations when doing most interactions
+ Microcams/motion sensors useful and pretty cool
+ Shields have window to take them out through ok who tf designed this heist
its badly designed and i cant even complete it
heist music is good tho Now that the price has been reduced, I can recommend it, the heist is nicely designed, even if personally I do not appreciate the loud escape.
Grab it on sale, or via the Year 1 edition. I picked the wrong year to stop sniffing glue‚Äîat least that brought me some joy. Payday 3? Not so much. What should‚Äôve been a thrilling, action-packed heist experience turned out to be more of a test of patience and willpower. Instead of pulling off the perfect robbery, I was left trying to figure out how to escape the clutches of bad design, unresponsive mechanics, and the kind of bugs that make you question whether the game was even fucking playtested.   

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        In the end, Payday 3 feels like a crime scene itself‚Äîfull of near endless potential, but wrecked by execution. It‚Äôs frustrating because you can see the foundation of a fun, high-octane multiplayer experience, but it's buried under all these technical issues and design missteps. I get it, the life of a criminal is supposed to be unpredictable along with hardships, but this isn't the kind of ‚Äúwild ride‚Äù I had in mind.

Maybe if I‚Äôd never quit the glue, I would‚Äôve had more fun. As it stands, though, it‚Äôs a hard pass from me. Do Better. Payday has never been for the faint of heart, but I cannot even believe the %90 of people leaving a review left a negative one because they don't know how to beat it.  Very cool heist. Very worth it. Only remorse is not having every one of them yet. I need to tip this scale a little. Pretty good heist imo. Only problem is if you play stealth solo this, you have to be EXTRA cautious in escape. Because a stu*id developer thought that it is a good idea to adding the escape van to the across the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• street. But it is a skill issue :) The heist is itself is fun in loud and comes with a great soundtrack. I have no clue as to why others complain about having to move around bags, it makes me wonder if they've ever played the predecessor in that case",0.021026326577462943
947450,Super BOO Quest,game,False,"21 Oct, 2018","Adventure, Casual, Indie","Super BOO Quest is a lighthearted game suitale for every kind of player, from casual to hardcore. It is a mix of arcade, puzzle, and stealth, to be played alone or with a friend. The game is presented with 16 bit-style graphics, as a tribute to Super Nintendo.","TOO SLOW and clunky, literally bored while playing it on 4x speed. I have autism Fun little arcade style game combining a Pacman with puzzles. Lovely pixel art, solid music with a smidgen of humor. A single character playthrough takes maybe an hour and the game changes with different characters but it's fun enough to replay anyways. That being said there is a 2 player mode and an additional master mode for a bit more replay value. Nothing special but exactly what I need on a slow Sunday afternoon. [i] My Experience [/i]

There really isn't a ton to say about [b]Super BOO Quest[/b]. It's a top-down, arcade-style game about dodging humans while building up the spectral energy to haunt these cursed locations. I appreciated the Super Nintendo-style graphics and music, as the SNES was the first gaming console I owned growing up.

However, the game is kind of exacting, and you'll likely have many failures and near-misses as you proceed through these locations. I also found it difficult to figure out exactly how large my ""fright zone"" was (you have the ability to frighten humans in a small area around yourself). The game mentions that you can figure this out by paying attention to a ""violet ray,"" but this wasn't particularly helpful. 

I can recommend Super BOO Quest, but although I played it in co-op, I might recommend playing it single-player. With the game requiring the precision that it does, another player is more often simply a liability. Another game that I bought solely because it was played on LGIO. It's fun to play through a couple of time, but if you're a completionist, it get's repetitive - there are 5 unique characters to play with, though the levels remain the same. As a game where you collect orbs to generate spooky power to scare your enemies, and plenty of puzzles to overcome, this game is really great! There are a good amount of character selection with varying difficulty levels. The levels you are taken through each have their own era and theme, which keep progression fresh. I originally played this game for my Frightober series on Youtube because of the 16 bit feature, because my computer can't record more graphically powerful games. This game is a delight to play on those computers who can't play games like minecraft without lag. Its super fun, quick if need be, and challenging enough to make you think. Each themed level takes about 20 minutes, and is perfect for those who want to play a little at a time.

For a playlist of my whole playthrough, that link is [url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_c9AXFI9rSGYONzj27f3NkukncXLqhjZ] here [/url] A cute little puzzle-arcade game that is very simple yet charming and fun. It is not without faults, but there is so much to love in this authentic indie game, that players can forgive some of the gameplay ingenuities, or some sporadic inaccuracies of the control system (it's mostly the collisions against the walls that can be annoying at times).
It is especially enjoyable with the local multiplayer, like most of SEEP games.
At this price, if you are a fun of retro games, it is really a no-brainer... it will definitely give you some hours of honest, carefree fun. Very simple arcade-puzzle action where you have to get enough energy pellets to fill your ""boo meter"" in order to scare humans.  It feels less like an SNES game and more like one of those weirdo 90s arcade games that you've never heard of but you accidentally find and have a fun afternoon with. 

Surprisingly fun.  It's nothing amazing or something you should go out of your way to play but if you've got $2 to spare, it's worth a shot.  It's short but never boring! Pretty funny game with a various contents to unlock (characters, endings and other sfuff).
The gameplay is fine, graphics nice and sound mediocre (but the voice was very good).
So I think is a good game for kids and who love happy-go-lucky games in 16 bit pixel art.

[h1]Summary:[/h1]
A puzzle game that anyone of any age can enjoy. Considering how many jump scare horror and Halloween games there are out there, it was pretty refreshing to play something with a more relaxing pace. From what we played, the puzzles ramp up their difficulty logically, the retro graphics are nice, and the music is charming. A lot of variety to be had for just a few bucks.",0.15146186440677964
1689510,RPGScenery,game,False,"27 Jan, 2022","Indie, RPG, Simulation","In the RPGScenery application, you can move around stunning live scenes explicitly created for TTRPG, change their weather in real-time, and switch to battlemap mode with one click.","I open this up once in a while to see if I am wrong. But I can still not find any use for it. Very pretty though, but I can't see what use I would have of it.

 Cheaper than Roll20 assets. Looks amazing. Pretty expensive to have a library of scenes, but I like the versatility of scenes: you can change weather, time of the day, season, pan, rotate, change perspectives, change grids, and every scene is a number of maps. 
I often use these maps when my dnd party is travelling Just picked this up.  I really like the tokens and would like to have more of them- but even still- for me this is a great app.  I'm basically using it as a screen saver- and I love it for that- great for setting the ambiance.  And it's so nice- turn the dial to make the sun set and the campfire comes on.  Turn on the snow and the trees drop their leaves.  It makes setting a scene sooooo easy.  I can get what I want in about 5 seconds.  And for me- I think the DLCs are at a great price- I've bought about 2/3rd of them and am very happy with what I got for $2.00 each- kudos to the scene builders.  This one's a winner for me.

Edited addition- something else I really enjoy about this program that went beyond my expectations was the sound scapes that go with the scenes.  For me- this really adds a lot. -ITs amazing, but it will be nice to add some Tokens or at least images of the players... just with some Images it will be nice. Its nice, but most of the DLC is exotic locales and cant be used for any scenes in my world or any other world. The dev should be concentrating on more generic scenes. like a castle with simple interior. I cant use a war elephant, and if I did, it would see a one time use. The scenes of the dark castle have no interior? The ship has another ship beside it...cant use that. just wanted a single ship on the ocean. When I think of scenery, I think of a good location  for role playing, not combat. A tavern, a sitting room, a library, a bedroom, a living room, the captains quarters, a throne room, etc... DLCs are way too small for their price. refunded after realising i couldn't make my own map. This product has been a disappointment.  

The maps are pretty, have good animation, and good customization with light and some weather effects.  That's it for the Pros.  

The Cons are many.  
The maps are way too expensive for the use I get out of them.  I'm sure it took time for them and they deserve to be paid for it but they are asking too much.  
Take the farm countryside scene.  Due to the limitations of how far you can zoom, I can't get the full yard in one map, much less the farm house, yard, barn, field, and windmill all in one battle map.  This has no way to stitch scenes together to create it, so I have to find a way to do that myself.  
The Mine map can't fit the full map on one either, so again, I need something else to make it useful.  
The Crypt is small, still doesn't fit on one map, and would take an adventuring group about fifteen minutes to finish.  Not enough there.
The Camp is useless as a battle map.  It could create some nice 3D scenes to show players but as soon as you go to the only top down view allowed to create a map, everything is hidden by trees.  Sure, makes sense, but then it looks like a forest, not a camp!  
Pretty much repeat that for the rest of the maps.  They look nice and might get some nice 3D views of them but you can't put even the smallest of them onto a full map to export to use for a VTT.  

On top of that, it's dead.  No updates in six months, no communication.  I can't recommend. I bought this with the intention and hope of updates to allow more customization options... it's been months with no update after it came out and all the DLC is priced super high with just different scenes. Dead in the water. Do not buy. 

I'll change this review if anything actually changes.",0.2550184822787563
1017130,Ikao The Lost Souls,game,False,"6 Feb, 2019","Adventure, Indie","Ikao, a little bluish creature, suddenly finds himself in the abyss of time without any memory. After coming out he has no choice but to travel the world in search of answers to the mystery behind his past.","I give the game a cautious endorsement, but beware of an issue with this game regarding refresh rates. Set the refresh rate of your monitor to 60 Hz, or you will have a bad time. The characters movement speed is chained to the refresh rate. The higher the refresh rate of your monitor, the faster they will move. At 144Hz, the game isn't playable. First off, the game wouldn't let me tab out at all, which I consider kind of necessary. Like a lot of small games, there's no options menu and trying to set windowed from Windows and Steam launch options doesn't work. I had to use DXWnd to force it to a window. Works okay once you set up all the options, but it looks like that prevents Steam from tracking in-game time.

There are some other smaller issues, but I still enjoyed the game. This is one of the few games where I didn't hate the [url=https://i.imgur.com/7jf8p7R.jpg]Helicopter[/url]-style controls. It feels like you have way more finesse than you usually do. Those sections are hard, but at least it's [b]not[/b] because the controls are awful.

The platforming parts are pretty fun too, I liked the moveset. And the aesthetic is great! It's a good platform game, it looks like a lot of fun. I have somewhat mixed feelings about [b]Ikao, The Lost Souls[/b]. On the one hand, the game is a challenging platformer and I mostly had a great time with it. But the game is far from perfect. In is my opinion, the main issues are:
[list]
[*]The core game mechanics feel unpolished and would benefit from some tweaking. You play as two characters, each with a different skill set. The two-tailed fox can walk, jump, double-jump, and teleport (I did not particularly like playing as the fox). The ghost can walk, jump and fly (playing as the ghost is a lot of fun). These are basic skills you will encounter in many platformers. What I disliked was that the jumps of both characters (but especially the ghost) are always of the same height, there is no ‚Äòshort jump‚Äô or something similar. This prevents you from jumping in a lot of places because you would instantly die on the spikes above.
[*]The double-jump is not very responsive, if you try to double-jump too quickly after the initial jump the fox will not respond at all to your input.
[*]The fox will insist on completing his jump-animation (a roll) first before doing the double-jump, so the fox hovers in mid-air for a split second. This prevents you from doing some tight and speedy platforming around flying enemies, you always need to keep a large margin otherwise you will most probably collide and die.
[*]The hit boxes around certain hazards are a bit too large. All these issues make for a lot of cheap deaths.
[*]There are 95 proper levels plus and ending. You need to complete each level before the next level is unlocked. The game get progressively more difficult, which obviously is good thing. However, some levels are way more difficult than others. I found the levels 75 to 85 to be much more difficult than the final 10. I am almost certain that many players will get stuck halfway through the game without any possibility to tune down the difficulty, or skip a level. To be attractive to players of all skill levels, it would have preferable if for instance not all levels need to be completed one at a time to progress through the game ‚Äì it is often better to take the tried and tested approach where for instance there are secondary (but very difficult) objectives in each level, so skilled players are properly challenged but if you find the level too difficult you can just skip the secondary objective for the moment, go on with the next levels and return to the difficult level when you finally got gut.
[*]The story is a bit weird and after seeing the ending twice I still do not completely understand. 
[*]There are a few other issues, but these are only minor. I did not particularly like the art style, nor the music, but that is totally subjective. Another thing is that you can‚Äôt alt-tab out of the game, better not try that or you risk crashing your PC. The game also messes with high-DPI settings for 4K screens.
[/list]

I don‚Äôt think this game is for everybody. It‚Äôs a pretty challenging platformer for fans of the genre, and if you do not like bullet hell or a screen full of rotating buzzsaws (often both, plus many additional hazards), you might wanna skip this one. Rating [b]8 out of 10[/b] for the levels with the white ghost, 5/10 for the other levels. Ikao is a hardcore platformer/bullet hell game with a nice visual style, a minimistic story, and 2 different play modes.

You start the game as a blue two-tailed fox who has lost his memory, so of course the best thing to do is just walk to the right and hope you eventually uncover your memory and your purpose.  As you progress through the game you will randomnly run into a spirit and your character will somberly put his head down and have a brief memory of his former love.  Progression through the game slowly reveals the relationship between the 2 and what happens and eventually ends in a surprisingly somber tone that I completely did not expect.  I won't get into any details here but the story is told well enough and does not get in the way of the gameplay.

The gameplay is broken down into 2 different styles.  About half the game has you playing as the two-tailed fox, these levels play like a standard platformer. Your fox can jump, double jump, and stick to certain walls.  The other half of the game is played as a white spirit who can jump and float around infinitely by tapping the X button.  Although your character is flying the best way to describe the control in these levels is like an underwater level in a Mario game, but you can jump off of surfaces as well.  Control in both playstyles is super tight, and control of both characters switches back and forth.  So you will play x number of levels as the fox, then the spirit and so on.  

There are about 100 levels or so in this game and it is an incredibly challenging game.   The game starts out simple enough and has a pretty nice difficulty curve but it gets really hard.  Every level is riddled with spikes, buzzsaws that seemingly reach forever, and cannons that shoot endless streams of bullets at you.  The amount of stuff going on at any given time gives the game a very bullet hell feel to it, which is odd for a platformer but works really well.  The levels are designed that there are virtually no safe spots and everything kills you in one hit, you need to be both quick and cautious to navigate some of these nightmarish levels but the feeling of beating some of these levels is incredibly satisfying.  You will die alot, but the game offers instant respawns that make you want to jump right back in and give the level one more shot.    

There are also orbs scattered throughout the levels.  I have no idea what these orbs do and I typically am the kind of player who just ignores out of the way collectables but for some reason I felt compelled to collect all of these orbs.  I believe I got them all and I'm not really sure if it did anything, so maybe there is some greater purpose to them, or maybe they are just there for the completionist in you, I don't really know.

What I do know is that Ikao was an amazing game.  It retails for $2 and for that price I was expecting some crappy flash game but decided to give it a shot anyway and I'm really glad I did.  The game is very unique, very well made, and insanely hard.  Definitely worth a playthrough if you are into hardcore platformers. I gave this game a try since it was on sale and the price itself was appealing to me. 
Actually It's a very challenging game (went myself nearly to frustration but there was always the motivation to keep going). and I loved the design of the levels and such. 
If you love platformers and a good challenge, this might be your game. Gave this game a genuine try. There's some good aspects to it, and ideas present, but it suffers from the issue that plagues many indie games, in that it's just a bit overly ""safe"" without really ever impressing me. The movement mechanics are pretty bare-bones and the level design doesn't really allow this game to thrive, at least as far as I got (like the 4th little chunk of levels).

This is made worse by some mediocre presentation. Visually, the levels change very little in between, even when mechanics are added. The design of the levels is often pretty dull and overly simplistic. The obstacles changed very little from level to level, and there really wasn't much character to any of it; the character art in game really did not impress me, some of the animations just didn't sit right and weren't satisfying to use (the double-jump or the floating ability) and the minimalist storytelling did little to immerse me into this game (and the lack of a cutscene skip feature is kinda upsetting), and you end up switching characters with no real sense of rhyme or reason. Also, this game has some atrocious sound design; the sound effect for footsteps made me want to mute the game, and the music was just incredibly slow atmospheric/ambient music played ad nauseum, with no real soul to it. 

Furthermore the game seemed to have a bug any time I ran it where if I tried to alt tab, the window would open a couple seconds later, and this even forced a PC restart.

It is a 2$ game so I can't really say I regret giving it a go nor that I expected it to be fantastic, but it still didn't feel worth it. There was effort put into the game, but I felt it was missing any real soul to keep me interested, at least for the hour-fifteen or so I played it.",0.020127241179872746

-More detail in story(Like how the story treats the main character & the conflict around him)

-Remade the story in an interesting way 
cons 
-Very bad fan service & dose not stick to its roots of the original series well 
-no be 
-normal Ending
-Bit to short 
-Some ilustations are hard on eyes 
-The story is a remake from the original not a new story 
I recommend this game to anyone who like's there romance light novel but dosent want any fan service  

In my personal opinion  I prefer the original due to the be & the characters had more details on the characters them selfs. Another reason is price & due to not all content being in at launch After I finished playing the New Time Tenshi, I have to say that this game really catches me off guard. This game is interesting and unique. Not to say I don't have some ups and downs in this game, but this game really sends me on a wild ride through my time playing it. I'm already coming up with theories or what if ideas that might happen. To start off, I would like to talk about some of the ups and downs I have for this game, warning: there are spoilers ahead:
UPS:
1.	Kenji and Tensai:
This game did a really good job at portraying the main character, Kenji Johnson. Especially with his emotional states. When Kenji feels sad, I admit I would shed a tear or two as well. When he angry, I could feel his anger and understood the stress he is going through perfectly. What also made me like Kenji in this game is how analytical he is compared to the other characters. Literally, he was able to piece together who the ‚ÄúCommander‚Äù was, in either the main story or the alternate route. And when he is placed in an argument, he can not only keep his ground, but also contradict his opposition.
For Tensai, I would say he by far my most favorite character in this game, even more than the other girls and Kenji. I love how this version of Time Tenshi shows how stress or worried Tensai can be, I mean he also suffers from the fire incident along with Kenji. What made me like Tensai the most is this line, ‚ÄúNow this machine has taken another of my friends from me...‚Äù This literally made me feel like just how much of a father Tensai is to his team members, even when angry he still cares for his team.
2.	Choices:
I had a lot fun with this game choices, many of these choices are used to help Kenji find ‚ÄúSticky notes‚Äù and gain ‚Äúaffinity points‚Äù with any of the three main female characters, Kyo, Rose, and Michelle. And depending how much affinity point gained for a specific character, a new route is unlocked to gain a different ending for the game. I literally made a list to see if I can get all the dating scenarios and both ending for this game.
3.	Storytelling:
The story for this game is one of the best I have ever read. The emotions, the situation, the conflicts, and the argues all left me with my mouth wide open the whole time. There were many times when this game would have me jumping off my chair when playing. Specifically, ‚Äúthe china chase scene,‚Äù ‚ÄúKenji and Mizuki coward arguments‚Äù and ‚Äúthe bottle scene (either choice). These scenes were too perfect. I love how in the ‚Äúchina chase scene,‚Äù how this basically confirmed that a character who disappeared in the time window is still alive and how Kenji had his first argument with Mizuki. For the ‚ÄúKenji and Mizuki coward arguments,‚Äù there clash with the idea of who is more cowardly was really interesting. I mean we have an armed ninja vs an unarmed protagonist, and the protagonist was standing his ground even when threatens with his life, he did not even flinch. Finally, the ‚Äúbottle scene, whichever choices Kenji choice, there are two amazing outcomes that happens. Both outcomes left me with one of these two emotions, 
‚ÄúDrop the bottle in the bucket‚Äù https://j.gifs.com/yx24ME.gif 
‚ÄúAttack Michelle‚Äù https://64.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4dh4xcA2F1rn5beeo1_500.gif 
4.	Hidden Characters:
This game has me really excited for upcoming characters such as the ‚Äúcheerleader‚Äù and the ‚Äúprincess.‚Äù  I also like how this game made me curious about Petra, whether we will see her or not. Maybe Petra would be like the sixth ‚ÄúPower Ranger‚Äù or ‚ÄúSuper Sentai‚Äù of the group.
DOWNS:
1.	Characters nitpicks:
Mizuki and Bunni:
I love how this game adds a little bit more to these characters, such as how much Mizuki believe in the risk and how she keeps calling the good guys cowards and how Bunni is trying her best to hide her sorrow. But I just wish we could have more interaction with these girls a little bit more. 
https://64.media.tumblr.com/eb146691f4ebd54fce09a2dfc0fdaaa6/tumblr_nfa19goGhL1qc7cmzo3_500.gif 
Kyo and Rose:
For both Kyo and Rose, I kinda wish that their dating scenario with Kenji were a bit more meaningful, I think it‚Äôs because I was having a hard time trying to figure out when did these girls had a date with Kenji in this game compared to Michelle, was it during or after the main ending. For Kyo, I‚Äôll admit I kinda miss her pervy side in Time Tenshi 2. For Rose, I wish I could have seen her casual outfit more often.
Michelle:
My only complaint, her time effect scene was so short. Guess I am never destined to see Michelle‚Äôs reaction to a time effect (as I remembered TT1 and TT2). https://i.pinimg.com/originals/51/5f/c5/515fc550166bcd60a40ec39fa02c0176.gif 
2.	Illustration:
I will admit, I wished that this game had more illustration. I felt that this game mainly focused more on the texts and the characters sprites and special effects. Personally, I would like to see more illustration, at least that fit with the story. Just because my eyes get tired easily from reading too much, I blame my habits for my studying.
https://media1.tenor.com/images/1624fbe7cfd927495e81c52938dae8a5/tenor.gif?itemid=5428221 
3.	Time Effects:
My only complaint for the time effect is that I still feel curious. I want to know more about the new rules or laws that the effect has. Like are certain effects are more likely to happen to specific characters.  What effects are worst case? And will there the consequence?
4.	Too Short:
This game was too short, I need more. https://i.pinimg.com/originals/82/e9/e7/82e9e7713acefba2eccc892a0abe7493.gif 
Overall, this is an awesome game to play, I highly recommend it for anyone to play it. I really want to see how much Kenji will grow as a character. And how will the story progress in the next game.
Some wishes I have for the next game or maybe the third game:
Quantum Guard:
I really want the next game to reintroduce the quantum guards again, but maybe add some new features, such as maybe invisibility or elemental attacks. 
Kenji time suit and Quantum Guard:
Seeing how all the girl‚Äôs transformation a based on the magical girl genre, I would like to see Kenji transformation be inspired by the tokusatsu, such as Kamen riders, ultraman, super sentai (power rangers) and metal heroes. As for his quantum guard, it would be cool if Kenji‚Äôs guard would allow him to either fuse or make union with one of the girls at a time, for example, if Kenji fuse with Rose, his suit would turn yellow, based on her hair color, and it would take more of a knight like features.
Transformation example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6niA6gfOTEo 
Michelle and everyone trust towards her:
Seeing how everyone‚Äôs interaction towards Michelle after the paradox, I feel that she is going to have a hard time gain the trust of the others. I would like to see how different many of the characters interact with Michelle compared to TT2. Maybe Rose and Kyo would have a hard time trusting her, just like a sibling betraying their other sibling. I could not tell if Kenji fully remembered the previous timeline in this game, but I would find it interesting if instead of having flashback of the ‚Äúfire,‚Äù Kenji started getting some flashbacks of the previous timeline, maybe in order to gain ‚Äúaffinity points‚Äù for Michelle, Kenji need to find ways so the others can start trusting Michelle again. As for Tensai, I have a hard time seeing Tensai acting cold towards Michelle just like in TT2. Maybe, when he is acting cold towards Michelle, he just tries to hide is worried for Michelle. Maybe in the next game a scene like this may happen to Michelle and Tensai.

Evil Kenji (introducing alternate timeline):
I always wondered if Time Tenshi would introduce the alternate timeline.Maybe there a Kenji where he goes crazy after throwing the bottle and he started going on a mental rage hunting down different Michelles from a different timeline. [ EDIT: I have gotten into contact with the author of the original Time Tenshi. His words are here and he provides his own damning insights on Silver Cow's nefarious business practices.
https://www.deviantart.com/mysteryguy9215/journal/Hey-Silver-Cow-855450980 ]

[ EDIT 2: I have also gotten into contact with the writer of this game and his confusing and unclear reasoning for what he's done.
https://www.deviantart.com/orionpax09/journal/Time-Tenshi-Reviews-856275226 ]

I'm a woman who writes erotica. I'm asexual, but sex-positive. As someone who played and loved the original, this is my take.

I believe that sexuality is beautiful. Sex can be cute, kinks can be great for story elements. Breast expansion is a rare fetish that I feel needs more positive portrayal. The original Time Tenshi was this. It had a great story that flaunted its sexuality while still being a good tale to follow.

I don't know why Silver Cow felt the need to remove the heart from their game. Perhaps they were misguided in believing the sexual elements were holding them back... Perhaps they didn't like them in the first place and they were only added for a reason out of their control. Perhaps they felt they wanted to be more respected as game makers who didn't make sexy games. Either way, I feel they were misguided.

As someone who writes erotic stories, I like to focus on how the sexuality can be part of the story. The world isn't a children's show. Red light districts, brothels, sex shops. They exist. But what would they be like in another world? What is the potential for perversion for this power? What is a story element that might make someone feel their sexual interest isn't so shameful? What things can the character get into that is sexy, but can also be fun, cute, and a story?

Stories can be sexy. That's nothing to be ashamed of. I enjoy putting lewd elements in my stories to make them wider. I also enjoy making those stories and worlds deeper and heavier even though they have lewdness in them.

Silver Cow removed the beautiful sex-positivity from this game. They replaced it with very little. Some slightly expanded story, romance routes, and some extra animations, but... At what cost? The game lost its heart. And what was added in doesn't actually make up for what was removed. More importantly, what was added doesn't justify the price compared to the original when the original still has its heart, even though Silver Cow crudely plastered a ""(2015)"" retroactively on the original, a crass act of defilement of their old work to show clear favoritism to the neutered remake.

Does it have some things improved? Yes. But the desecration its emotional heart wasn't worth it. The original had an amazing story with some beautiful sexuality to it. Now it's just an above-average story that was gutted in a misguided attempt to make it better or more respectable...

I enjoyed Silver Cow's work. Now I can't actually support them as a game studio who I thought had true artistic integrity when they're going to spit on their older work with a poorly-priced remake that retroactively stains the title of the original and removes far more than it adds.

There's also the dodgy Kickstarter behind this and the rather sketchy lack of transparency. Nowhere does this Steam page clearly state that it removed the sexuality of the original. They're not lying, but they're clearly being misleading through withholding information. It's entirely possible they may get a few extra bucks from people going in expecting a faithful and expanded remake, rather than a shadow of its former self made through misguided vanity.

I'll end this with a quote from the Kickstater campaign.

""Our goal with Time Tenshi is to create an entertaining, high-quality and well-told story-driven experience with a focus on character building, romance and a gripping plot. The focus this time will not be on breast expansion.""

Not only with this quote squirreled away at the bottom of an FAQ section, but... This proves they're either lying or just incredibly misguided. Their game WAS story focused with character building and a gripping plot. Breast expansion wasn't even the focus, and you can have a breast expansion story with character building, romance, and gripping plot. In fact, that's part of what made the original Time Tenshi great: It had ALL of that. To mutilate their game while claiming it's better in every way... I would call it despicable if it weren't so pitiable to see them do something so misguided.

It's worth noting the team made videos for the remake advertising features that weren't in the final game, like voice acting. However, these features were relegated to stretch goals which weren't met, which suggests they intentionally removed features they'd already worked on to try and paywall them, and then when the paywalls weren't meant, they kept them out. I should also note that ""Switch release"" was a stretch goal, and even though it wasn't met, it still came out on the Switch.

I should also note how shady it is that Silver Cow refuses to speak to fans, not even Kickstater backers. They're an indie development studio. Transparency is their greatest tool, and they refuse to use it.

I'm sorry, Silver Cow. It was fun while it lasted. I only hope that your current path is worth the cost for whatever you hope to gain from it. Goodbye.

[ EDIT 2: Word from the author of this game, again, may be found here.
https://www.deviantart.com/orionpax09/journal/Time-Tenshi-Reviews-856275226 ] Before I get into the review, let me get some things said now. This is a reboot/remake of the first game with no breast expansion and very little fanservice. My opinion on it? I prefer it. Sure, this franchise is infamous for BE, but I felt this series was trying to focus on the story more. This VN isn't a fanservice VN with time travel, but a story involving time travel WITH fanservice. However, I can see why people put more focus on the fanservice. Another thing is the failed Kickstarter and the things that weren't able to make it in the game. Things like Voice acting, more illustrations, and even romance routes for the villains weren't added in. However, I'm going to judge this game as to what we were given, not what it was supposed to be. Anyways...

Time Tenshi 2020 as stated above is a reboot/remake of the first Time Tenshi released in 2015. It has a couple of changes such as a page to listen to the music, more elements added to the story, and a SKIP and backlog button. Additionally, romance routes were added into the story in contrast to the original in which it was only used for like one scene. The story is the same: You are Kenji, a boy that is brought to his grandfather's lab after an unfortunate incident leaves you with no parents. With all of these things and more, it seems like Silver Cow wanted to improve on the original and focus on the story here. How did it go and is this better than the original? Let's find out.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
- There are a couple of characters that were handled here, but I'll talk specifically about Kenji and Tensai. While Kenji is the same character, this VN gives us more time showing that despite feeling inferior to the others, he has some intelligence as well. Adding on to that, this version gives a few more scenes that gives us a better understanding on how this incident is affecting him. As for Tensai, I like that he is more involved in this version. It may just be with some new changes or the things they added in this story, but I feel like Tensai is handled better here as well. 
- Speaking of the things that were added, I like how they implemented the new character in the story. She didn't show her model, but from what the characters say about her, I'm excited if we are able to see her if SCS is planning on rebooting the franchise. For the romance ""routes"", one was done in a very unique way that I wasn't expecting. I enjoyed it. Some of the effects are nice. My favorites are the energy flowing in the lab background, the animation on the text box and the binary code that shows up when characters are in the time window and are about to change outfits. 
- The art and backgrounds are done well. The character models look nice and their mouths move. It makes them feel more alive.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
- I know I shouldn't judge the game for what isn't in it, but Mizuki and Bunni needed more screentime. I feel like I would've given this game more points if we were able to see what those romance routes given us. I'd imagine we could have gotten to know them a little better.
- Speaking of romance routes, I felt like most of them weren't handled well. I get what they were doing with one of them as it did a lot to make it unique, but it just makes the other ones feel inferior. Not to mention all there is from getting enough affinity points for a girl is [spoiler]a very short scene that's while nice, could've had a little bit more time to it. [/spoiler]
- In my opinion, I think Rose and Kyo were more memorable in the original. In the original, [spoiler]Kyo feeling inferior was done better there as they set the mood with the different background music.[/spoiler]
- Lastly, performance. I know my laptop isn't the best, but I have played a couple of other VNs and it ran fine. I encountered on two instances when I clicked to advance to the next line of text, but the game stopped for a few seconds.

[h1]Nitpicks[/h1]
- There were a few grammar errors that I came across while reading through this VN. For example, one line goes ""They're even bigger cowards then you..."" where ""then"" is supposed to be ""than"".
- While I liked some effects, there were some that I wasn't a fan of. One time window side effect of changing a character's skin could've looked better. Additionally, one scene where Michelle is listening to music didn't need the additional movement. It shows how stiff these characters can move sometimes, and it makes her move like a popsicle stick puppet.
- One scene had Kyo in her uniform, but she is wearing casual clothes in a CG.
- I'll have to get used to Michelle's design here. I liked the original design of her as she looked older. 
- The opening song was nice, but the visuals need a little work. Was the part where you showed Bunni's and Mizuki's character cards for like 3 seconds necessary?
- The art quality could use some work as there were some jagged lines when I looked at the illustrations in the Gallery. 
- The music menu looks a little boring. Maybe add something unique to it?

[h1]Overall Thoughts[/h1] 
That was nice. Time Tenshi 2020 adds onto the existing story while taking away breast expansion. In my eyes, they did a good job. While they weren't able to add everything they wanted, I think they did a fine job with this game. Despite my negatives like some characters not getting as much time as I'd like and the performance, I think my pros outweigh the cons. If you care only about fanservice and breast expansion, then you should buy the original. If you want a good story with added elements to make it provide a little more than the original and some neat effects, then buy this one. Want to buy both? Why not? If you are a newbie to Silver Cow, I DEFINITELY recommend getting it when it's on sale for a price that is to your liking. That is if you are interested in this VN. In closing, with the absence of BE, Time Tenshi gives you the same story as its 2015 version but with a lot of changes that make it the better version. Until my next review, thanks for reading and have a good day. If you are a fan of the original you will likely be very disappointed.
They completely removed the BE stuff which was what made this series good in the first place.
It's like if you remade PUBG without guns and expect people to buy it again.
Waste of money.
 Interesting take on the classic.

So, let's get the elephant out of the room.

There's no BE in here.

Yes, now that we have that out of the way, this is a wonderful story with memorable characters.

The story is told in a much more warmhearted and emotional manner than the 2015 version.

The music is very good

The animation is much better than previous entries. This game is only a remake of the first Tenshi from 2015, and the only difference is no BE?!? (And some little story differences)

Removing the best part of the game from the remake and replacing it with a magical girl transformation was the worst idea that Silver Cow could have done.

I feel sorry for Silver Cow, after the Time Tenshi: Paradox Failure and now this game...
Obviously some decisions were made at Silver Cow, which have a very bad impact on the Time Tenshi series.

Is it worth buying this game?

For someone who liked the old Time Tenshi's: 
Clearly wasted money

For someone who plays this game before the other Time Tenshi games: 
You can try it, but the older Time Tenshi's are much better and cheaper. I would not recommend it. A remake of the first Time Tenshi without the breast expansion.

This feels like a generic Anime visual novel.

1063730,New World: Aeternum,game,False,"28 Sep, 2021","Action, Adventure, Massively Multiplayer, RPG",Experience a thrilling action RPG set on the supernatural island of Aeternum. Forge your destiny on an adventure filled with danger and opportunity.,"its lowkey ass but a fun grind if u like leveling tradeskills like i do If you enjoy it, thank me later :-| Very nice game, but after 4 years on PC using like 10% of its potential, so there are a lot burnout oldie players who cannot be satisfied anymore.
My Opinion that the action combat of an MMO best on the market, but devs still don't know their own roadmap, and very very slowly add new stuff, which 2 of 3 times came with big mistakes..
If you are 1st time to experience it, you will enjoy it for sure, til you end up a meaningless circle after geared up for end game. Depends on you it can offer 200-1000 hrs enjoyable time.

+the detailful sound work is absolutely positive. If you‚Äôve ever played Neverwinter, the Dungeons & Dragons MMO, you might recognize some similarities in New World. Both share a somewhat simple combat system at first glance, but New World stands out by offering a more refined and rewarding experience. Unlike Neverwinter, which is often criticized for its problematic monetization and pay-to-win mechanics, New World manages to avoid these pitfalls, allowing players to focus on the game without constant distractions from microtransactions.

Combat System:

At first, New World‚Äôs combat may seem simplistic‚Äîat least in comparison to some other MMOs. However, the more you play, the more you‚Äôll appreciate the underlying depth. If you‚Äôve ever played World of Warcraft (or any other game with a tab-targeting system) and found yourself wishing there was a bit more skill required in landing those chaotic, powerful attacks, New World will scratch that itch.

The combat system is dynamic and engaging, requiring real-time positioning, dodging, and aiming. It's a refreshing take on the traditional MMO combat mechanics, and it provides a level of satisfaction that‚Äôs hard to come by in games that lean too heavily on a ""press-button-and-wait"" approach. Whether you're wielding a sword, casting spells, or swinging a warhammer, every action feels deliberate and impactful, making the battles feel more like a test of skill than simple number crunching.

Story and World Design:

One of the standout features of New World is its incredible world-building. The environment is amazingly crafted, and the level of detail in both the visuals and the lore is remarkable. From the dense forests and foggy swamps to the snow-covered mountains, each area has its own unique feel and atmosphere. It's clear that the developers put a lot of thought into creating a living, breathing world that‚Äôs rich in history and filled with opportunities for discovery.

The story itself is intriguing, though it serves more as a backdrop for the exploration and survival elements. That said, the world of Aeternum‚Äîthe setting of New World‚Äîhas enough depth to pull you in and keep you invested in its mysteries. Whether you‚Äôre uncovering ancient ruins or delving into the story behind the corruption that plagues the land, the narrative weaves seamlessly into the gameplay, offering plenty of incentives to explore every nook and cranny.

Crafting System:

The crafting system in New World is another highlight. It's comprehensive without feeling overwhelming. There‚Äôs a real sense of satisfaction when you gather resources and craft items, whether it‚Äôs weapons, armor, or consumables. The system is complex enough to feel rewarding but doesn't require excessive grinding or micromanagement. Whether you‚Äôre an experienced crafter or someone new to the mechanic, there‚Äôs something deeply satisfying about creating items that directly impact your gameplay. Plus, the materials and crafting stations are scattered across the world, making crafting an integral part of your journey, not just a side activity.

Overall Impressions:

So far, I don‚Äôt have a lot of negative things to say about New World. The game excels in so many areas: the skill-based combat, the stunning world design, and the rewarding crafting system all come together to create an experience that feels fresh and exciting. There‚Äôs a good balance of depth without overwhelming the player, and the attention to detail in the game world is evident in every corner.

If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs looking for a traditional MMO experience with more skill-based combat and a world that feels alive, New World is definitely worth checking out. It‚Äôs a refreshing change from the typical MMO formula, and whether you‚Äôre a fan of Neverwinter, World of Warcraft, or other MMOs, this game brings something new to the table without the frustrating pay-to-win mechanics. Terrible example of game design. Minning, Logging, Fishing The lock on ruined what made this game so good. Everyone in the community sais the exzact same thing. Dev's just dont listen is why the numbers of this game are so dead. Some of the best harvesting and gathering mechanics iv played with. which leads to my next point, the crafting is awesome. lots of skills to level up and cool things to make that really help in gameplay. combat is fun and can is a nice blend of skill and clicky clicky. good. I absolutely love this game, However AGS is simply the worst dev team. I found an XP bug that gave infinite xp from simply restarting any quest. Made a video of the bug, then reported on the forums and to customer support. Next day I was banned for a week or so for bug abuse. What? Why are you banning players trying to help improve the game? 

There is also the issue of Angry Earth, You are basically paying $30 for the ability to use mounts, something which should have been in the game from the beginning. You also get a ""new"" zone however its just a re-skinned starter zone that is now for end game, instead of just adding a new zone altogether. 

AGS has made an absolutely fantastic game, that they simply dont care about. Its just there to milk money from the microtransaction store and expansions that add basic functions that should have been there from the beginning. They dont care about the game, they dont care about the players, and its starting to show as player counts hit all time lows even during peak hours.",0.1330551786521937

Still have hope for this. I purchased, but got a refund after 45 minutes. It's a good idea, but they need to make the aiming more accurate.

The animations are stiff, it's cheesy and the missions are repetitive and lacking but it's still a lot of fun... Plus, we need to support porn games so we can get even more developed! Some genuinely funny moments but the best that can be said about the game is that it was more enjoyable than BoneTown I watched Sean Connery and George W Bush get head from Tyrande Whisperwind. This game might seem like a decent option for some casual gaming, but it seriously drops the ball with its achievements, which are some of the worst I've encountered.
Playing on hard difficulty only ramps up the frustration as enemies dish out heavy damage and they have spongy health.
I hoped that UPGRADES might balance out the game-play as you progress, but they HARDLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. 
If you are aiming to 100% this game: it's best to pass on this one. So, for what it is, it's good. However, everything this game does, Bonetown does better, but if you like the vibe, then I would recommend it. I enjoyed what I played and it was worth the shekels. I plan to play more in the future.



 Better than Dragon Age: Veilguard Well, back in my day... I got this game from a friend of mine that said he don't like this game.

Now this game appeared on Steam..... Why not. Fun little nsfw game. TRASH. I feel kinda sad having to downvote this one. But while I wish the devs the best, I kinda feel I have to. I want the reviews of my h-games reflect their quality as well and steam has a huge issue with people leaving ""haha boobs"" reviews on such games, making it very hard to find the good ones.

I heard it was better than bonetown. Not in my experience. I enjoyed bonetown, but I did not enjoy this one.
It's not open world, the missions are very boring, the weapons feel like they have absolutely no punch (several shotgun shots to the face and the dudes are still not dead, it's an eternal whack-a-mole) and often it feels like you're hit by invisible enemies because apparently some elf archers can shoot across the whole map with pinnpoint precision or something, the h-scenes are exactly the same as in bonetown except your character is a space marine midget, and in the real game there are just orks (that differ oly in clothing) and elves (that differ in clothing and color), all other girls are not in the story but just in an extra menu and just copypasted from bonetown. The humor is very childish but not in a good way (""I'm part of her cabinet"" - ""I don't care about her furniture"", haw haw) and it runs about as stable as a whore after a night of ""anal on the house"". It doesn't even shut down cleanly, you have to kill the process in task manager.

It's.. just not fun.

Noah Pleases God
9 These are the descendants of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God. 10 And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

11 Now the earth was corrupt in God‚Äôs sight, and the earth was filled with violence. 12 And God saw that the earth was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted its ways upon the earth. 13 And God said to Noah, ‚ÄúI have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence because of them; now I am going to destroy them along with the earth. 14 Make yourself an ark of cypress[a] wood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch. 15 This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. 16 Make a roof[b] for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above; and put the door of the ark in its side; make it with lower, second, and third decks. 17 For my part, I am going to bring a flood of waters on the earth, to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die. 18 But I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons‚Äô wives with you. 19 And of every living thing, of all flesh, you shall bring two of every kind into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female. 20 Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind, two of every kind shall come in to you, to keep them alive. 21 Also take with you every kind of food that is eaten, and store it up; and it shall serve as food for you and for them.‚Äù 22 Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.

The Great Flood
7 Then the Lord said to Noah, ‚ÄúGo into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you alone are righteous before me in this generation. 2 Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals, the male and its mate; and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and its mate; 3 and seven pairs of the birds of the air also, male and female, to keep their kind alive on the face of all the earth. 4 For in seven days I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground.‚Äù 5 And Noah did all that the Lord had commanded him.

6 Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth. 7 And Noah with his sons and his wife and his sons‚Äô wives went into the ark to escape the waters of the flood. 8 Of clean animals, and of animals that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground, 9 two and two, male and female, went into the ark with Noah, as God had commanded Noah. 10 And after seven days the waters of the flood came on the earth.

11 In the six hundredth year of Noah‚Äôs life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened. 12 The rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights. 13 On the very same day Noah with his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noah‚Äôs wife and the three wives of his sons entered the ark, 14 they and every wild animal of every kind, and all domestic animals of every kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every bird of every kind‚Äîevery bird, every winged creature. 15 They went into the ark with Noah, two and two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life. 16 And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him; and the Lord shut him in.

17 The flood continued forty days on the earth; and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth. 18 The waters swelled and increased greatly on the earth; and the ark floated on the face of the waters. 19 The waters swelled so mightily on the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered; 20 the waters swelled above the mountains, covering them fifteen cubits deep. 21 And all flesh died that moved on the earth, birds, domestic animals, wild animals, all swarming creatures that swarm on the earth, and all human beings; 22 everything on dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died. 23 He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, human beings and animals and creeping things and birds of the air; they were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark. 24 And the waters swelled on the earth for one hundred fifty days.

The Flood Subsides
8 But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and all the domestic animals that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided; 2 the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained, 3 and the waters gradually receded from the earth. At the end of one hundred fifty days the waters had abated; 4 and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. 5 The waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.

6 At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made 7 and sent out the raven; and it went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth. 8 Then he sent out the dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground; 9 but the dove found no place to set its foot, and it returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took it and brought it into the ark with him. 10 He waited another seven days, and again he sent out the dove from the ark; 11 and the dove came back to him in the evening, and there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf; so Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth. 12 Then he waited another seven days, and sent out the dove; and it did not return to him any more.

13 In the six hundred first year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and saw that the face of the ground was drying. 14 In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry. 15 Then God said to Noah, 16 ‚ÄúGo out of the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons‚Äô wives with you. 17 Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh‚Äîbirds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth‚Äîso that they may abound on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.‚Äù 18 So Noah went out with his sons and his wife and his sons‚Äô wives. 19 And every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out of the ark by families.

God‚Äôs Promise to Noah
20 Then Noah built an altar to the Lord, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 21 And when the Lord smelled the pleasing odor, the Lord said in his heart, ‚ÄúI will never again curse the ground because of humankind, for the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth; nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done.

22 As long as the earth endures,
    seedtime and harvest, cold and heat,
summer and winter, day and night,
    shall not cease.‚Äù

The Covenant with Noah
9 God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, ‚ÄúBe fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth. 2 The fear and dread of you shall rest on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the air, on everything that creeps on the ground, and on all the fish of the sea; into your hand they are delivered. 3 Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; and just as I

743850,Polyroll,game,False,"29 Oct, 2019","Action, Adventure, Indie","Explore branching levels, fight quirky bosses, and save the day in this retro platformer inspired by the classics!","Pretty decent platformer with surprisingly fun bosses and enjoyable sonic-like movement. You'll probably like this game a fair bit if you enjoy oldschool platformers but I do have some gripes.

The heart palaces are oddly huge difficulty spikes although I'd say an enjoyable challenge they seem too overtuned compared to the rest of the game, although this isnt a problem unique to these stages as theres a few other odd difficulty bumps. I will say though the third heart palace I didn't find fun as it was riddled with these bouncy balls that erratically toss you about which feels very rng and frustrating; something not ideal for a level that demands speed and precision.

Furthermore, the reward for the heart palaces is.... underwhelming for the effort you put in. You get more HP slots however when you respawn you still spawn in with 1 HP... making it pointless in most scenarios you'd want it. This segues into my gripes about the HP system as a whole. Its an oddly confused system in execution even if I like the idea, as you are rewarded for not getting hit... with being able to get hit, which means you probably dont need the extra HP. This makes a lot of boss fights a tad more punishing than they maybe ought to be as your forced into basically needing to no-hit or two-hit the boss. I think a fair change would to let the heart palaces not only give you an extra heart container but also an extra starting heart, making them much more useful and feel worth the challenge for more casual players.

Other than that, the only other issue I have is the hitboxes are at times... questionable, particularly on some bosses like the  ghost one or the final boss. Despite that and overall its still quite a fun game with some great levels and a pretty polished experience; I don't regret my time at all but I wouldn't say its anything anyone MUST play. Buy if youre really into platformers like me. a solid 9,5 experience great 2d mascot platformer colorfull and very nice sprites and for a very  humble price spicy gyro games never stop impressing me It's a cute little platformer, pretty short and relatively easy to beat. Would recommend! Reasonably fun but not gonna blow your socks off. The music is a drag, as well. As a joke i muted it and pulled up the sonic 2 ost and the game suddenly felt a lot more fun to play, which just goes to show you how important banger music is.

But yeah, if you want a sonic like indie game, this one's not bad, especially for the price. I had fun This was a fun game! Overall it was mostly easy but there was a little difficulty mixed in. I do think the ball rolling and ""spin dash"" mechanics could have been executed a bit better, they felt awkward to use but maybe I'm too use to how that works in Sonic?
Also for anyone going for all the Achievements the ""Brickmaster"" one has a typo in its description where it says ""Destroy all breakout bricks on Dice Palace 2"", the actual level you want to do that on is Dice Palace 1. Yes, this is a good Sonic game clone. But sound design is awful. Like very bad really imho. Keep that in mind if you want to buy it i played through this entire game with the music muted, incredible experience. 10/10 Cheap, fun, perfect length Sonic deconstruction.  Short snappy levels with well-hidden macguffins to collect.  Highly recommended for a lazy Sunday. Great game. Classic Sonic fans will enjoy it for sure. Definitely not flawless but It has some really original level and boss concepts, some great music and pixelart. Being able to rocket roll (spin dash) bounce on every wall to reach secret areas and skip sections of certain levels is such a cool idea. I'm excited to see where the devs take the series next with Polyroll Pocket! I remember when my parents got me my first - and as far as what's important in life goes, only - Sonic game, I was enamored not so much with the speed (which I couldn't build up fast enough anyway), but with the physics, the platforming, and the new, mind-affecting premise of a character turning into an enemy-damaging ball *just by jumping*. Later when I started to see other platformers, I noticed they didn't do this, but Sonic could, and it became even more wonderful to me.

Later on I figured how to move more quickly, but the physics and the premise of what could be done with that ball form have always interested me more.

Enter Polyroll, a game that wears influences on its sleeves, including Sonic, but trades away the blistering haste in favor of the platforming.

Before I lose my review again, I'll simply post here. Suffice to say that Polyroll succeeds. Bouncing becomes especially important for challenges to clear levels, both for familiar things like bouncing off of enemies, and for the new premise of bouncing off of walls to climb and round odd corners.

The presentation is superb. It reminds me - if not outright brings me back - to all those interesting screens I would see on my cousin's Supernintendo and feel horribly jealous of, and even after the jealousy cooled off, still was intrigued and curious about. This world seems to have dreamlike qualities fitting a game from the late 80's or anywhere in the 90's, yet still stands on its own in visual approach.

For me, personally, who or what we play as, and where, matter in and of themselves, and as far as real life animals go, I've wanted to play as a cartoonishly cut-ified bug for some time. Polyroll matches this, and a chance to play as one of those pillbugs I loved to watch as a kid while my parents chatted with my aunt back inside is welcome indeed, even - and in a way, especially - if he's a cartoon drawing here. More importantly than this, though, one thing that seems to be intact from his real worldcounterparts is his size. There are some environments that seem like they'd be roughly human-size-hero oriented, like the beginning hills and what looks like a factory, but then we found ourselves in sawmill parts and even inside a computer! This drives home that Polyroll is actually supposed to be tiny - and to be honest, I really love that. I want to play as more tiny heroes.  More importantly, these levels take good advantage of their respective settings with area-appropriate gameplay gimmicks, like the rolling hills and an icy area having ramps that let you roll off into the air, casino areas seemingly set on top of a line gambling makshevs having playing cards and chips that make platforms and act as obstacles, along with bouncing balls that encourage you, in a sense, to *take your chances*; and various circuitry-oriented gimmicks in the levels set inside of computers.

My main criticism is that the reward for getting near, then completing, the ending is underwhelming. After you beat the game, you just get different color pallets for Polyroll - not even new stats or bonuses or penalties or anything, just pallet swaps - and in a chase scene right before the final boss, one of the biggest mistakes of the Sonic franchise - Rubberbanding AI - comes to call for a wall of spikes that's chasing you. Rubberbanding AI for situations like these was always a mistake that denied us players the reward we deserve for successfully getting faster and smarter on the run, and it's a downer here likewise.",0.14707600870584298

665060,Triangulate,game,False,"11 Aug, 2017","Casual, Indie, Strategy","Triangulate, a game that is easy to learn but hard to master. Stack the falling triangles to create bigger triangles of the same color making them disappear along with the black background. A very simple concept, but doing it for an entire level requires quick memory, clever strategy, and great dexterity.","I must express my disappointment. Initially, I believed a Tetris-inspired game featuring a triangle theme would be engaging. However, it turned out to be quite tedious, lacking any combo mechanics or exciting gameplay elements. The only notable feature is the ability to construct upside-down triangles. Each level feels interminable, and correcting errors is a time-consuming process. Once you clear the black sections at the bottom, you are left with the task of building an unattractive base to access higher areas. Overall, the experience is rather unfulfilling.

Triangulate is a game that is straightforward to grasp but challenging to excel at. Players must stack falling triangles to form larger triangles of the same color, causing them to vanish along with the black background. While the concept is simple, completing an entire level demands quick thinking, strategic planning, and excellent hand-eye coordination.

Only a true TRIANGULATE MASTER can conquer all nine levels, particularly the final three, which require exceptional skill and perseverance. Unfortunately, the controls‚Äîwhether using an Xbox controller or a mouse and keyboard‚Äîare far from responsive. It feels akin to a stutter in gaming; you must repeatedly press a direction to move a piece. Unlike Tetris, there is no option to rotate pieces into position.

The graphics range from uninspired to unattractive, and the overall presentation feels disjointed, reminiscent of the 1990s. Additionally, I found no option to enlarge the small game window.

On a positive note, the music is decent, featuring around a dozen tracks.

The ""how to play"" section suggests this may be a port of a mobile game. According to the credits, it was developed by a single individual. Brian, while I appreciate your effort, this game is not suitable for sale on Steam. I encourage you to continue learning about what makes a game captivating. Consider Peggle as a reference; its concept may not be groundbreaking, but its presentation keeps players coming back. No. Just no. I thought a tetrislike game with a triangle theme would be interesting. But it is a drag, there is no way to do combos or anything. The most interesting thing is that you can build upside-down triangles. A single level takes forever and fixing a mistake takes ages. After you cleard the black at the bottom, you have to build an ugly base, just to reach higher areas. All in all, playing is very unrewarding. 

The controls (xbox controller or mouse and keyboard) are not even close to being snappy enough. It's like the gaming equivalent to a stutter: You have to repeatedly tap a direction to move a piece. And do you remember how you can rotate tetris pieces into place? Not here! 
The graphics are between bland and ugly. The presentation is all over the place and reminds me of the 90s. Also, I found no way to increase the teeny weeny window size. 

The music is not as bad though and there appear to be around a dozen tracks.

The ""how to play"" page leads me to think this is a port of a mobile game. The credits say, it was a one man project - Brian, I don't want to crush your spirits but this is not a game to be SOLD on steam. Please, keep on learning what makes a game interesting. Take Peggle as an example. The idea behind that game is not very hot but the presentation makes you come back for more.

Blow up the creatures before they try to kill you!,"Holy shit, why the fuck did i bought this game. (I checked receipt and i only spent 0.1 cent) It is priced about 2 bucks. I got severe motion sickness. What the fuck. (It has trading cards so i guess It was worth It to me?) It's an asset-reliant mess of a game that doesn't seem to have experienced any actual playtesting before it's release to Steam. Look at the other titles from WTFOMGames and you'll see the pattern: it's all just rubbish games trying to hustle people out of their cash. I am 32 years old.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you. No sane person would waste time with this mess. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNvHFbjZHuQ

**QUICK THOUGHTS**

I went into this game expecting another generic horror themed title on Steam everyone would probably forget about pretty quick. Yes, the graphics looked like crap and the game boring due to the trailer on the page. Thankfully, this first person reimagining of Bomberman from indie dev WTFOMGames is honestly not that bad a title. This isn't to say it isn't without faults.

Every stage you feel like you're walking on ice, making it very troublesome to navigate. On top of that, the mouse sensitivity is incredibly high to the point that you wind up doing a 360 degree turn with a meer twitch of the wrist if that. But once you get the hang of the controls and movement of the enemies, which all move along a pre-determined path (or so it seems) unless you're right up next to them.

As it stands, Sapper's Bad Dream isn't as bad as the trailer makes it out to be. Yes, visually it could do with a lot more work, but overall being cast into a labyrinth with ghosts of past bombermen (or so I assume they are) is a nice, lamenting touch. The game has its issues, not to mention some really out of place enemies, but even with those it still stand a surprisingly fun, even tense little offering.",-0.06201449344306486

And the ‚Äòicing‚Äô on top is those terribly annoying sounds the little creatures make non-stop during the game (!)
You can find a much better ‚Äòtreat‚Äô elsewhere. This one will only leave you with a sour 'taste'!  
 [b]Intro[/b]

Defend The Cake is a tower defense game with some mazing. You place sandwiches and towers to force the enemy (ants, bees, worms) to take a longer route while your towers attack them.

Playtime: 94 minutes/9 levels

[b]The Good[/b]

-    Cute theme.
-    There's nothing really wrong with it.

[b]The Bad[/b]

-    It's kinda basic.
-    No difficulty levels.
-    You have to micromanage temporary boosts.

[b]Conclusion[/b]

Defend The Cake is not a bad game but not something i would recommend. I just stopped playing after 1,5 hour, it simply lacks schwung.

[b]5/10[/b] Short but fun. I have played tons of TDs. This one took 13 hours. There are some bonus maps left but I cant motivate myself to touch those after the 100% achievements.

It's a solid TD. The balance is good which is probably the most important aspect for any TD. It's challenging but never steps into the ""is this level even possible?""-realm. 

I like the undo-wave mechanic which makes it possible to fix your mistakes without having to start it all over. So it's more difficult to gimp yourself completely, and not as rage inducing when you leak a few mobs on the last wave. It's probably not something you want in every TD, but it works well here.

Graphics are underwhelming, but the theme and design is consistent and works well. (Rolling pins? No one would ever be able to tell from those graphics!)

It's not a super innovating game or anything, but it was fun and challenging all the way through. And what more can one ask for? Unique tower defense game with limited moves per turn. Strong, simple Tower Defense game. The mechanics are robust enough for interesting gameplay and the style works. The twist of having a build phase during the day and a defense phase during the night is great and I think more games should use it. You get a number of actions to build things and then, during the defense, you can use that number of actions to empower your towers for a short time (this power is limited by number of birds, so you can only have six towers buffed at a time, but the birds return a short cooldown after they are used). A longer campaign with a layer of research improvements, like more egg birds or cheaper toast walls or things like that would easily propel this game into even greater heights. 

As it is, though, it is well worth the time and effort to 100%. It's tricky enough to be satisfying, but the game gives you powers of convenience like the ability to rewind to previous waves and undo your build choices to adjust for a wave further down the list that you can't get past. Trial and error is a a necessary evil, and this game minimizes its impact. Rather than inflate your playtime by forcing a complete restart of the level, you can simply take one step back to account for the problem. More, if necessary, but it wasn't for me except on the last wave of the last level which had an interesting mechanic.

New stuff gets thrown at you throughout the game. There are the simple TD creatures, big slow bulky guys, super fast runners that come in groups, etc. There are some interesting, less common mobs, too; like crabs with apples for shells that gain speed as they take damage, grasshoppers than can leap over your defenses if they're too narrow, or worms that can only be hit when they emerge every so often down the path.

The choice to restrict upgrades is one I don't like. The worms drop spice, one or two depending on difficulty, and that's what you use to upgrade towers (up to two times). The upgrades themselves are sometimes lackluster, as well, though the Cheese Knife's additional burn and empowered hit damage are both good. Others were sometimes useful, but situational, like the Watermelon Slingshot's buff to range and attack speed (both first stage) and boost to the empowered projectile (second stage). The Strawberry was in a strange position where it felt a lot stronger at level two, but not much stronger at level one, and here comes a problem--the build mechanic restricts you from upgrading twice in one build phase or building a new tower and upgrading it. This is slightly annoying.

I found that sometimes there would be slight bugs, like an inability to select one tower because another one was too close. This often happened with the Rolling Pin, which attaches to the side of a tower, not the top; if it was at a strange angle or another tower was close, then it would sometimes become impossible to empower or upgrade. There were also times where things felt like some luck was in play, but I never found that I needed to be lucky. I could always outplay the luck, which is a good thing for a Tower Defense.

All in all, this was a sleeper hit for me. I really enjoyed this game. It was a fun five hours of achievement hunting for a few bucks. There are some extra levels after you complete the game as well, but I haven't gotten to them yet. I enjoyed my time, but I think I've had my fill. I respect the developers for sticking to the game length they did, as it provided the perfect pacing. If you like TD, give it a shot. The game isn't terribly long or deep, but what is here is great-- worth the money even if not on sale.  I loved the entire time I played and would appreciate seeing a follow-up effort. This is a fun strategy game. It's really hard to get no band-aids but I like that you can go back a day to retry. This game is excellent!  The art is cute and fun, and the levels start simple and move swiftly to challenging.  The high score feature is great to test yourself against others.
Edit: With the most recent update, they have added additional Lotus levels that are wonderfully difficult.",0.07268222735504613

However it is pretty easy. [[[[An Unexpected Joyful Experience.]]]]

I'm a Chinese Youtuber (You can say so) who works mainly on terror games. I bought this game yesterday to make a video, since it seemed like nobody had ever did this game. I wasn't expecting much, thought it might be some jumpscares and so on. 

>After 40 mins playing>

Here,if you wanna watch it: http://www.bilibili.com/video/av12451351/

I have to say, this game surprised me really much, in the good ways. 
In this game, while waiting for the moon to set, all you have to do is fishing, burning ghosts up using the spotlight, repairing portholes, and pushing aliens (why aliens??) back using a fire extinguisher. But you will be totally wrong if you think it's a easy thing to do. 


Here is basically what happends during the game:


>Rolling the fishing lines

>Hear the porthole breaking

>Go downstairs to repair it

>See a weird light coming from above

>Aliens come to steal your fish

>Take the extinguisher to drive them away

>They took one or two fishes anyway

>Turn around and find dozens of ghosts REALLY close to you

>Run upstairs to get the spotlight

>It's too late, a ghost bite you (Or should I say ""touch you""?)

>Hear the porthole breaking

>.......

A sense of rhythm is very important, and when you get used to it, you will definetally enjoy the trill it brings you. 



And to the developer, here is what more I want to see in your future updates:

>>A better performance on Graphics and Audios. (Ghosts in this game seem somehow CUTE to me, at least. And the sound effects have A LOT OF space to improve. )

>>Maybe some impressive Musics? In order to increase the tense. 

>>CO-OP Mode. It can be an Endless Mode where you defend the boat with your friends, and try to survive as long as you can! Has to be fun!

>>A longer story mode and some more boat upgrades. I'm pretty sure it's already in your plan, just in case. 

Highly recommended. its a pretty neat game. basically you need to run around a boat keeping ghosts at bay, fixing leaks, fishing, and stopping aliens from stealing your fish. you use the fish you catch to buy upgrades in preperation for the blood moon which i imagine is a very extreme version of the normal days. it's pretty unique and if you like those kind of games you will find the price for this pretty fair.

This DLC enriches Galactic Civilizations IV with unique technologies, planetary improvements, starship components, and a new mission: Return of The Korath.","Appreciate the extra narrative content! overpriced dlc sadly, the dlc should've only cost half. not worth the asking price of the dlc! even stellaris dlc's have double the content / features. sorry stardock but i am heavily disappointed and regret buying the expansion pass when it came out, just to get hafl assed dlc packages. 

i mean also the upcoming ""megastructure"" dlc in december...you only give us FOUR (4) megastructures for 20 EUR? i mean they are just pretty looking starbases with big economic bonuses. stellaris always add those in their dlc's as an added gimmick to fill out the dlc, not sell us 4 (!) megastructures for 20 EUR with no added features. really cheap stardock! You can rush star base modules. Other than that, I didn't notice any improvements.

This DLC makes no meaningful change to anything in the game. 

It is embarrassing that they charge money for this. More events are always a good thing and a welcome addition. I haven't dug my teeth into the scenarios yet as they aren't really my thing. Very poor value.Some new buildings and they didnt even bother to do it for all factions,some ship parts,events.Very low budget work imo. Played a few games without this DLC. Bought the DLC and liked the new things I've seen so far. Good dlc from a Great company. Happy to find this gem around the holidays. I have NO idea what this DLC added!

Possibly darker void space in game?  Maybe some extra spectacular asteroids?  I'll bet it's the intergalactic snack shop I built on my home planet (could have been dreaming on that one)?  

It does not list anything clearly besides a new story.  I only really play sandbox. 

The game however is fantastic.  I'll give it a thumbs up.  Can't tell what was free patch and what was included with this DLC.  The description is incredibly vague! Best TBS 4x game This game keeps just getting better and better.  There have been some really nice UlI changes in the latest patch.  While this DLC may not deliver any new systems it does add enough small things to make the price worth it.",0.07888224348750666

. . . . . .Ukraine . . . . . . . . . . . . . America . . . . . It's fun Bridge building game, not sure what else can be added. I had fun. easy levels are easy, medium levels get you thinking for the next stage, hard levels get hard fast, complex levels are impossible if you don't have a proper intuition of how the mechanics of the game and structures work. 

I remember back in 2004, when I was 8 years old, i downloaded this demo... bridge construction set, which I eventually bought in 2008. This game is a continuation of that game. I recognized several levels. however, it still is full of proper challenges without resorting to weird non-realistic structures, unlike other bridge builders, like for example ""Bridge Constructor"" (which I regret buying). 

I don't know if it's nostalgia, but for 7$ it's more than worth it. It will make you think and will help you appreciate the nuances of structural design, even if just as an introduction to it.

Parents, buy this game if you think you have a future engineer in your hands. Honestly Its  pretty good game and is literally the reason I have steam honeslty 9.5/10 needs more raytracing. It runs fast, and didn't crash. But that's as far as the positives go.
It's basically a more ""realistic"" looking version of Polybridge, but with fewer and generally worse levels. There are less variety, less freedom, the controls are worse... And about the graphics, actually, even in 1440p they still look super pixelated and strange. It can be a mildly entertaining distraction, but there is no reason to ever get this instance of a bridge building game when better alternatives exist here on Steam. Fun game, makes you think outside the box All of the problems I described below seem to be fixed !!! Awesome !

I played this game once. It was a cracked version back in the day. Come to think of this game again and wanted to see if it was on steam. And it is. But I have to admit that the cracked version worked better than this version. I can't set my graphic settings. It gives me the message I need to restart the game for changes to take effect. But when I start the game the changes didn't take place. Also the profile thing doesn't work. Can't create or delete a profile. And the previews of already completed projects doesn't show the bridges I build. The cracked version however did do all those things. At least now I have payed for playing the cracked version back in the day. I don't recommend buying this game on steam. Best look for the old DVD version somewhere. But for this little money I will still enjoy this game despite looking like 240p.

A little addition. The game doesn't save anything. So when i close the game and start it the next day i have to redo al the previous bridges i already passed. How can this steam version of the game be even worse than the original ? Gonna look if i can download this game somewhere else cause this is just unplayable. It's becoming a trend here on steam. Same with Saint Row 4. Can't play it anymore. And steam does nothing about it. No more games on steam for me !

This game had so much potential, i bought it when it was getting some talk and updates but there hasnt been any updates in..........well this game is in purgatory. dont bother.

Thankfully i managed to get a refund.
Dont bother One year without a word from the devs, even more for an update. Game is abandoned. Do not buy. *Updated Review as of 6/27/2018*

My opinion has not changed.  The devs have literally abandoned and run away for hell or high water.  Due to the amount of fraud, or aka games that come in early access to gain money only to  abandon their project after profits are made should be banned or blacklisted. Steam should hoenstly keep track of game developers, both their company name and and if possible members of the dev team to ensure that they will not be employed again in this industry and to help others by warning them that a faulty unfinished product was their initial idea in the very beginning. I invest in the minority or the little man, and half of the time they don't turn out to be the friend that they say they are.  They are only here to make a quick dollar and screw over the consumer and the fan base that was led to believe in them for a finished product.  This is another prime example of why steam needs authority and/or rules to punish or ban fraud game dev studios/ devs. Makes me lose hope for indie games and the underdogs.  

I remember when i first saw this game. It looked really cool and it was fun for a few hours. I uninstalled and waited for some progress to be made.  It is now 2018 and nothing has changed except for the fact that the devs literally don't even respond when questioned/emailed/asked about the game.  I am dissapointed. This is actually not review but WARNING to everyone: this game has been abandoned by developer and left in early development stage. Far too early to consider this as complete product of any real value. I strongly advice: do not buy it. Acually I think Steam should remove this game from its shop.
(which is unlucky as the general idea was quite interesting) [b]***[u]DO NOT BUY, ABANDONED GAME!!![/u]***[/b]

Devs acknowledged an issue I reported on Steam forum on March 5th, 2017. See here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/415010/discussions/1/135510669600619675/
Last message on my tread by a dev was on March 20th, 2017 and the issue I reported is still not fixed.

Because I'm concerned of my purchase, I tried to reach out to the devs trough the email they provided to Steam for support: no luck. I tried another one I found from their website: same thing. I also tried to speak with the devs on Steam (2 of them posted in my topic), still no luck...

I think it's safe to say that the game is abandoned, last update was on 24th of February 2017 and devs ran away.

If anyone reads my review and previously bought the game, please consider leaving a negative review as well to warn potential buyers and report the game so hopefully it will be removed from Steam. Remove this game entirely from the store. The dev has flown the coup! I bought the game and played it. I didn't think there was enough content to keep so I wanted to refund it. A developer told me they were planning on adding things and continuing to develop it. 

They lied. It's been two years. No updates. Not even a conversation going on here. The game seems to be abandoned.",-0.08753906250000001

Keep track of the situation based on their voice reports only. Lead US platoons to clash with Vietcong in a realistic, innovative approach to the RTS genre. Make hard choices in a narrative driven experience, and face the outcome.","Great idea, looks promising and is fun at first, but quickly becomes a tedium, with how missions are scripted and structured.  

My patience for this game ended at mission 7/9, and I went to play ""Radio General"" instead, which I found to be better in every way. It's somewhat unusual in that it is a historical revisionist, pro-fascist game. the game is a lot of fun but the dlc squad commander makes it more complicated so i recomend just getting the base game I applaud the premise and the idea of the game. I hope the devs will continue working in the same genre, and will have a great success with The Radio Commander: Pacific Campaign.
But I unfortunately cannot give a thumb up to this game.
The dev company is called ""Serious Sim""; I take it that ""sim"" here means ""simulation"". Well, the problem is the game is anything but. In fact, any deviation from VERY strict (and VERY vaguely written) mission objectives literally breaks the game. 
A couple of examples:
-In a first mission I had to move my company to a rendezvous point with another company and then move toward enemy camp. Not understanding that, I move my company right to that camp... and it just wasn't there. BECAUSE IN IS SPAWNED ONLY AFTER I CLEARED PREVIOUS OBJECTIVE.
-In the forth mission I had a special ops unit and a regular company. and had to free hostage from enemy camp. I scouted it  with spec. ops (as intended) - it messaged me that i need to send regulars as a backup. I did it and cleans the camp with regulars. Nothing happened. Upon reading guide I realized that SN EVENT WITH FREEING HOSTAGE will ONLY fire if I send the spec. ops. back into camp. Because I didn't do in from the start, mission was a failure.
And there is stuff like that in every mission. 
All of it could've been outweighed by capturing perfectly the atmosphere and grim reality of the setting... but as someone who had incidentally red a book on the war I had to unfortunately state that what the game IS capturing perfectly is a POP CULTURE IMAGE of the Vietnam war, rather then the thing itself. Some of the examples:
-US troops are constantly seen as delusionless, deeply cynical about the war and it's goals (in fact the morale failure only happened late into the war, under Nixon, who kept troops in the field while openly negotiating withdrawal) 
-Press is constantly criticized by troops as unpatriotic and defeatist (In fact US media were actually pro-war up until the Thet Offensive, when it was proven then the US Army routinely lied to them on VK strength) 
-(most glaring to me) ARVN, the South Vietnamese army, is nowhere to be seen, and treated as a non-issue. (In fact it was pretty much always bore the brunt of the fighting, constituted a serious % of all male population of South Vietnam; the war is frankly more of a Vietnamiese Civil War then anything else) 
Again ‚Äì I do think it is a great idea and hope to see more game like this in the future. But this one is better to be seen as a first attempt, brave, but ill-fated. This game is a bomb! 
a joke about Pr. Donaldson's sister in the first mission gives it 12 dead VCs from 10.    


P.S.  Seriously, it's an incredible atmosphere - I highly recommend you try it! Words cannot convey it! I got the worst bug ever: the radio is not working, and there is nothing happening. Naturally I cannot proceed with the game. I cannot reset the campaign. The game unplayable for me. So disappointing, I have high expectation for this. great game but u need to b able to grid read an listen play story b4 commander if nothing else ... helps to understand alil battle formation an functions b4 i.e. hammer an sickle or pincer but not needed Didn't follow the script, broke the game on the first mission. Neat idea but very flawed execution. Neat concept, and I don't regret supporting it for its vision alone.

If you like ty I can recommend this soundtrack, if not than, why the fuck are you here anyway? That moment when you realize that your ears can have a boner The TY series' soundtracks are a combination of acoustic, chill tunes as well as cheesy guitar nonsense with a local outback flavor. Sometimes you'll get something completely out of left-field.

The most memorable soundtracks are the more relaxed tunes that suit the 3D platforming zen of the series, but there are some songs that get me pumped to go wild when the guitar riffs play. 

Definitely pick up this soundtrack if you purchase the base-game. There are over 6 HOURS of music within this DLC, and you're bound to be humming one or two songs afterwards.

If you're not sure if the soundtrack is for you, I'll recommend my favorites (I'll limit my choices to five) from each game to look up for yourself.

I realy enjoy this game and hope for more Hercule Poirot series! The story is far too simple to really be a Christie, and has nothing to say societally, so I can't really see how this got the Christie estate stamp of approval unfortunately. In terms of puzzles to solve, it's really easy. Not really worth it tbh First Cases was much better. This edition is just kind of janky to say the least. After playing my fair share of detective games I feel like this is worse than its predecessor and the bugs are one reason but not the only one. I saw many say that the mechanics feel like they were added to the game but without any thought on how these mechanics or 'mini games' would add to the experience and I agree. Not a thought must have went into it because while the game is short, the story and the chapters are boring, monotonous, and the repetitive mechanics aren't even fun. If you're trying to have a linear, narrative story without any room for the player's own free will of discovery then you should not implement things that jumble up your system and confuse the game. Finally, I despise the addition of Hastings. The amount of times I went back and forth in the same room only to find out I needed to talk to Hastings was honestly offensive. Now, you could tell me I am bad at the game for not knowing I must speak to the man however each conversation of 'recap' of the clues or findings was REGURGITATED from the mind map and had already been word for word figured out by Hercules!! He does not add insight and I think the devs were just trying to add a companion similar to the Sherlock Holmes games. Further, some of the mechanics and the mind map I think were completely inspired by the Sherlock Holmes games which are older than this series by nearly ten years. Inspiration and taking from games is not the issue- the issue is not knowing how to implement them or why players enjoyed those features in the first place? Fortunately I bought this game in a cheap bundle but this is just beyond frustrating. delicious Only buy it if you are a fan of Poirot, the game itself is alright, but could be better. Regardless, I had fun with this one! :)",0.06797244094488186

[i]These are all reskins of exactly the same game![/i]  What value is there in this spam/pollution glutting the Steam store for gamers?

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics. 

This looks and feels like a mobile app, but it doesn't seem to have made it to the app stores.  It's unclear why this was put on Steam instead of the app stores it seems to have been designed for.  Maybe it was removed, maybe it was rejected by Apple and Google (they do have more rigorous quality standards than Valve does for Steam, after all).

Regardless, for all intents and purposes this might as well be a mobile app, it has the same limitations and dumbed down qualities.  It's impossible to recommend such a game to PC gamers.  We don't spend all this money building gaming rigs so we can pretend they're iPhones and play games that might as well be mobile apps.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 3 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

""1001 Jigsaw: Earth Chronicles 9"" has the farcical price of around $5 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam. This publisher 8floor managed to arranged 1 card game and then copy-paste it with different sfx, wallpapers and made 200+ games. its quite a fun game to kill your time",0.018221352467927825

Nice job, Devs. :)  Def worth the price (as i believe in supporting VR and dont think it makes sense for devs to work for free. I don't work for free, why should i expect them to?)

This was a good, brief simulation and my kids and I enjoyed it. I'll also be demo'ing it for others that come over since it's short and to the point.

Make sure you click the start button in the beginning or you won't be able to move the game forward and pick stuff up, etc.  

Thanks for creating this!  PS: My 5 yr old LOVES the dog and plays the game over, and over, and over, and OVER...  just so she can hide during the earthquake with the dog.  Nice work! TERRIBLE - JUST ANOTHER WHIMPY CASH GRAB BY A DEVELOPER. No sound, cannot grab/hold objects as instructed, animations done by coder with 4 hours experience, flame effect dismal. Refunding this - do not waste your 6mins and then be forced to refund. Not a bad VR experience at all, even though its very short. I like the idea behind this, and I personally think this is some serious stuff that most people should try. I made a first look VR gameplay of Earthquake Simulator VR, so you can judge for yourself. At the end of the gameplay, I¬¥m giving my thoughs what I wish could be added, and also my opinion about the pricing:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGxUkAOXcv4

To sum the video up:
This is a 5-10 minute VR experience, with only one earthquake scenario. If you do it once, there¬¥s not much more to explore, and I personally think its a shame - as this title has some great potential. Think about it, how many possibilities we have in Virtual Reality creating different earthquake and house fire scenarios. Please developers, add more different scenarios, more content, more different ways of escaping and hiding from the earthquake. For example:

- What happens if the fire starts by the exit door? Or upstairs? 
- What should we do if we are upstairs and the fire starts on ground floor? 
- How should we act if we have several pets, or kids and family at home? 

Also, give us more information about all the 14 items we should collect in the ""preparation"" part on this simulation. Why should we need every one of these items, and how can we use them?

I mean, you could add endless of different scenarios and content into this - and THEN make download content (DLC) that we can pay for. This ""introduction"" scenario in the current version of Earthquake Simulator VR should be available for free. Its something that every one of us should get the chance to try out. It could be about life and death - this is serious stuff, so I see this as public information for everyone, and not only for those who spend 3 euro on this. 

Don¬¥t take we wrong, I can easily spend 10 euros or more on DLC's if you add the content Im mentioning above. But in this current state, this version should not cost a cent.

Anyway, thanks for this release - this is something that can get really huge in VR - once you do it right. Thats why I give it thumbs up. I hope you will continue to work on this simulator - and Im looking forward to play more!

Only my 2 cents
Cheers

570600,Binary Trigger,game,False,"1 Nov, 2017","Action, Indie","Binary Trigger is a virtual reality precision wave shooter, with an emphasis on accuracy and speed. Competing for the highest score is the focus of the game, and you'll have to be quick and sharp if you want to keep your score multipliers high.","Nice little wave based shooter that turns out to be a rather nice way of improving your ambidextrous shooting skills as points are awarded via shooting objects based upon the color of the guns and each of the guns in your hands are of different colors.  Worth the get.

Here's a video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAuPcCfeBf8 Premise:  A straightforward shooter with wave elements.

This is a non-moving, non-interactable shooter where you simply shoot colored things (cubes, balls and later small monsters and bosses, etc) with the opposite-colored gun.  In order to get a good multiplier you need to be fast and accurate.  

I'd recommend this game specifically for working on your ambi-shooting for other games.  I know my left hand doesn't seem to shoot where my brain tells it to sometimes.  This game definitely helped me work on that.

As it is (early access) there isn't much to it.  I definitely don't think it's worth the $9.00 they are asking for it right now.  But if you can pick it up on a 50-75% off sale, it could be worth your time for a some cheap wave-shooting thrills.

As a caveat, I'm recommending this game if it's deeply discounted AS IT IS NOW (6 Jan 2017).  They may have a patch that comes out tomorrow that breaks this or makes it amazing.  So, take it for what it's worth since.. you know, Early Access.

3575260,Only Sliding,game,False,"4 Apr, 2025","Casual, Indie",A puzzle game with one mechanic (sliding).,"I didn't think I liked sliding puzzles that much, it turned out that indeed I don't. This is one of those cases where I'm not sure whether it's fair to leave a negative review given that the game is pretty straightforward about wht it's going to be.

But I don't think the title fully equips the customer to make their decision, They still have to ask, isn't the fact that an experienced game developer got this into sliding puzzles a clue that there might be something really magical here?

And my answer is, I don't think so. I don't see it, anyway. If you like sliding block puzzles it is [i]crazy[/i] good for the price, and if you're on the fence I'd recommend giving it a try. I wasn't sure how interesting I would find them and they ended up growing on me quite a bit. Portponky watched me play all the way through. Feel free to be jealous Good game!

However, if you intend to play it, I will warn you that this game with the title ""Only Sliding"", which has the description ""A puzzle game with one mechanic (sliding)"", as well as an ""About this game"" section with an extract that reads ""Only sliding is a logic puzzle game with only one mechanic (sliding)"", as well as a list of features with the only one being ""sliding"", does in fact only have one mechanic.

Now, to avoid spoilers I won't say what this mechanic is, but to anyone who makes the understandable and reasonable assumption that this game has more than one mechanic, this game with the title ""Only Sliding"", which has the description ""A puzzle game with one mechanic (sliding)"", as well as an ""About this game"" section with an extract that reads ""Only sliding is a logic puzzle game with only one mechanic (sliding)"", as well as a list of features with the only one being ""sliding"" has only one mechanic, rather than multiple mechanics.

Now, to anyone who is intrigued as to what this mechanic may be, but worried it might not appeal to them once they play, I will put in spoiler text the singular mechanic in this game with the title ""Only Sliding"", which has the description ""A puzzle game with one mechanic (sliding)"", as well as an ""About this game"" section with an extract that reads ""Only sliding is a logic puzzle game with only one mechanic (sliding)"", as well as a list of features with the only one being ""sliding"" here:

The one mechanic in the game titled ""Only Sliding"" is [spoiler] sliding [/spoiler]. This can also be spotted in the trailer for the game. If you are expecting multiple mechanics, or prefer games which do not have only one mechanic, like ""Only Sliding"" does try playing a different game, such as ""Ultimate Chicken Horse"" or ""Half Life 2"". Finally another difficult puzzle game from Recursed dude! Simple concept but hard as nails ice puzzle enjoyers are going absolutely sicko mode over this one, let me tell you Very good, very clever design.

Like a fusion of Mad max and Mario kart, super gritty, no grippy driving. 
Its the soundtrack thatll have me coming back for many more years. Ik had wel een vermoeden dat dit geen leuk spel is daar de controller niet werkt en je geen screens kan maken, zowel in de Voodoo Banchee - als in de software mode. Heel weinig verschillende wagens en een handvol tracks.
Neen geef mij maar DethKarz die is heel erg goed ! Nostalgia for the few who owned it back then and good enough for new people, very underrated.
This game is not just a hidden gem, this is an unknown hidden gem.
Very good for it's time.
Good and fun handling/physics
Looks good, sounds are good and OST even by today's standards.
I didn't think I would play a whole 20h just for some nostalgia.
It's all good. This was the best game back in the day. I sunk so much time into it. Still have the CD-ROM. Probably won't play it a lot on Steam, but bought it for a keepsake. The CD-ROM isn't going to last forever. You're here for nostalgia, and this game has it in spades. It's called ""powerslide"" because it feels like you're driving on soap bubbles at all times. In a weird way, it's pretty fun. Some of the tracks you unlock later are brutally difficult and hard to tell which way to go. The story talks about 2020 like it's some distant, far off sci-fi year, which is super amusing. The character bios and story are absolutely hilarious. Let's be honest, you're not here for a good racing game. Just go get forza horizons, or the newest gran turismo. You're here for vibes, and this game has all of the vibes. ""Stunt"" is the funnest track. This is an old PC game that came on a CD. The vehicle control and power-slides are great. There are some fun places to drive to, that are not easy to find. ""old school computer fun""   Works best with a quality joystick. I played this game for years as a kid and purchased for the nostalgia feel. As a racer it holds up although it is kind of easy. Always thought the real fun was all the cheat codes and easter eggs they hid all over the tracks so you weirdly have a reason to go off on your own and explore to unlock more hidden aspects of the game. Ah yes, the childhood memories I've been playing this game on and off since it came out in 1998 and I remember it really left an impression on me. What really sets Powerslide apart is the unique physics, which are not realistic at all but at the same time make the game so enjoyable. It's nearly impossible to make a turn without doing a powerslide, which at first feels like driving on ice, but somehow it controls just fine once you get used to it. Hitting the other cars is like hitting a wall and will barely make them move, but you can use that at your advantage to make tighter turns. The cars also don't bounce off the ground like they do in most arcade racers, if you do a jump and land upside down, the car will just stay in that position and slide for a few seconds then turn over. That's probably the only thing I don't like about the physics, it would be more fun if the car could just bounce off the ground √† la Rush 2 to make more impressive stunts. 

There is also several very fun cheats you can use to explore the levels and you can go anywhere you want as there are no invisible walls, which adds considerable replay value to the game. The graphics, which were considered very good in 1998, unfortunately didn't age well, but that doesn't take away the sheer fun of the game.",0.1387004453133485
1885080,Ark Defender,game,False,"11 Jul, 2022","Action, Indie, Simulation, Strategy","Roguelike missile command. Survive as long as you can aboard the Ark, humanity's last hope, in a hostile galaxy.","Interesting premise! It's a decent enough game, nice genre-mix but some improvements could take it to the next level.

-Art-
Firstly, I think the art needs a little touch up. As it is, it makes the game feel cheaper than it has to be. The first thing I noticed were the edges, they could be smoother. The UI art sticks out like a sore thumb in the corner, they look like placeholder elements. 

IMO, the ships could have better complementary colors, I can't really say exactly what it is but the colors kind of make it look off and cheap. Maybe slight changes in the color tone would make it feel just right. I can say that when looking at the store page, color decisions kind of put me off but the gameplay ideas drew me in.

I think the ship shapes are great, I had no problems with that.

-Gameplay-
There are great ideas here and it's fine as it is but IMO this game could [b]embrace the shmup[/b] more. In a lot of ways, it could feel faster. I think everything could move faster and it would be fine. Given the stationary position of the player (which is good and what makes it unique) [b]adding a defensive right click option[/b] (e.g. similar to what those green enemies in the first few zones drop off- like a temporary small shield field) would add new depth and allow the game to be faster with more enemies. The only time I felt the game came close to this was the trap event. I think the whole game can be like that and get there faster. I started out with normal which was too easy except for the first boss and the trap event. I tried the hardest difficulty and even that took a while to start up. 

I like the ideas with the population a lot, but I'd like to see more interactivity. For example I'm not sure how much pop health affects anything, I ran most of the game at 0 health but nothing seemed to happen? I assume that's why disease outbreak events happened later on? But they were easily manageable so I never felt it was an issue. Besides, there is no real way to consistently increase it besides the hospital ship which requires an upgrade to increase life, but even then it only happens at increments of 1 with a 40% chance. Maybe I was unlucky but I didn't even get any tech points until like level 30. This is what I mean when the game can be faster, if these points mattered more and we could interact more with them the game would feel faster. I have similar thoughts on happiness.

More abundant and frequent unlocks (besides ships, gun types, flotilla types, defensive options, energy options)  would be nice. What makes a good roguelike is the sense of frequent progress. Hades does this very well, obviously it's an unfair comparison but I think its design philosophy can teach a lot. FTL is the closer inspiration and that has a similar formula for unlocks, but you can also buy guns within a run in that so you get the sense of accomplishment and progress that way.

-Soundtrack-
It's okay and appropriate for what it is. Obviously budget is what it is, but with a more faster gameplay a more upbeat track would complement it nicely but I can't say much on that.

-Conclusion-
Overall I like the ideas, there is fun to be had in the game, but it can do more with what it has. Honestly, this is like a game Ssethtzeentach would review years down the line and make it pop off, but it needs some improvements to make it stand out a bit more. Did you ever wish FTL had a story mode? Ever wonder what it would be like to try and keep a population of 1200k happy? How about trying to calculate if you brought enough portable black holes to deal with this round of enemy ships?

I love this game so much. Your story plays out over the parsecs as you explore and fight your way onward. Highly recommend.",0.17797329654472507

I can‚Äôt recall another game that handles it so brilliantly‚Äîor gives the player such a strong sense of satisfaction with every step forward. Great depth in the storytelling. Ave! A fps mystery timeloop game where you figure out the full storyline in tiny pieces and get access to more of the map as you gather items.

It took me about 7 hours to complete the various endings.

+ The puzzles mostly make sense and are well signaled.
+ Most locations have multiple ways of getting there.
+ Storyline fits well together and intelligence is rewarded.
+ Characters make sense.

- Some of the invisible walls and lack of them are weirdly placed.
- Archery feels a bit annoying.
- Not much replay value after you figure out the main stories.

A pretty solid game. Maybe not for everyone, but quite enjoyable for what it is: A strange mystery to unravel. A good game with one of the most satisfying endings.

If you like games like Majora's Mask or Outerwilds -- you will like this one as well.  Not as great as those two but it scratches that need just enough. Highly recommend! Very, very fun. The game has a few flaws - places where a bit more reactivity would have gone a long way, where you can solve a mystery well in advance of the character, places where tasks you've been given seem to break, and you're not sure if they're unfinished or broken. And the worthless zipline system.

None of that really matters. It's fun and rewarding to explore and learn about the place you're in and the people who inhabit it, and that's all it needs, and it does it well. I wish more games were made this way. Amazing plot! An extremely interesting game with very deep conversations about philosofy.
With so many puzzle games being about environment and adventure games also having environmental puzzles, it is so refreshing to see a game that most of it's puzzles are people: what they believe, what they feel is safe, what they think other people will think...
The graphics are really good but face animations were weak at times. The game tells you if you don't want a horror/action experience.
The voice acting is really good and it needed to be since what you will do the most is trying to connect with people.

Not long game, has different endings... You should play it.",0.11516877637130798
1116880,The Heroic Legend of Eagarlnia,game,False,"13 Apr, 2022","Indie, Strategy","Lay out your grand strategy on the land of Eagarlnia where humans, elves, orcs, dwarves, and the undead each battle out a corner of land. Manage your territories by navigating complex decisions and grow your economy.","This is a fun lite grand strategy type game. All the YouTube videos showing the janky English localisation has pretty much been cleaned up and aside from the odd word choice here or there, it's just fine. The learning curve isn't too steep and there's a beginner mode that takes it easy on you as you learn the ropes. I *highly* recommend this game to fans of Gemfire or other games like that. Almost completed the achievements good game. Game doesnt have a massive amount of depth but for some reason it had me hooked for a long while, for the price honestly this game is damn good and to hear it was with a small team makes it even more impressive, look forward to seeing what other titles they bring out Build like a 4x but it has a loooooot of story telling. good Great SRPG Surprisingly fun, reminding me of the days of Dragonforce from sega saturn.

and the raistlin majere easter is interesting. Looks like someone is a fan of dragonlance series.

dont think most of the young chaps would know it tho.

PS: I really want to see a sequel to this game. Pretty good and cheap strategy game. You can control one of the about 20 factions each with their own heroes and slightly different skills in their tree.

To capture enemy territories you need to win two battles in a row 5vs5 and then with remaining forces 5vs(3+towers+gate) which can be pretty challenging in the beginning. Or you can retreat after the first battle and send another team if you have one, but then depending on total amount of enemy characters left you may have to fight 5vs5 again. So balancing developing your strength so that you can tackle two battles in a row and defense so that enemies are scared to attack you and investing in infrastructure for money gains to support your increased strength is the main part of playing this game. You also can collect a ton of different characters most of which have some lore but it becomes overwhelming so unless you get some outstanding character you will usually use the same teams as in the very beginning.

So overall it is interesting, but it is hard to deal with stronger or equal strength forces. Starting to snowball by solving the initial puzzle and keeping it rolling feels great though. The game is badly balanced for a strategy game. There are a lots of thing to do but some of them are just not good enough and you hardly do them.  Also the game have worse diplomatic system that I can see, feeling like every diplomatic move doesn't matter. 
 Great game, the translation is garbage tho",0.12538095238095237
377980,Mortos,game,False,"14 Nov, 2016","Action, Casual, Indie","Mortos is a FPS video game set in near future where the human race is dying after the arrival of the undead army, the hero has to fight and destroy completely all the undeads in various maps or places that are in different setting/scenarios to restore the dead city and complete the goal.","o live in hearts we leave behind is not to die. [b][quote][url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_flip]Warning: Asset Flip![/url][/quote][/b]Mortos is a Digital Homicide style asset flip, or what Valve calls a ""Fake Game"". The ""developer"" paid for/pirated a few Unity asset store packs, dumped them all in a blender, and submitted it to Valve as if they're real game developers.

The bulk of this game is just reskinning the old [url=https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/ufps-ultimate-fps-233711]Unity Ultimate FPS[/url] game package with some other assets stolen/borrowed from around the place... actually the game got more attention from the toxic developer harassing reviewers, and the review manipulation than as a game itself.  This is one of the games Jim Sterling picked up on when shedding some light on the increasing number of asset flips and other fake games that had started to flood Steam.  

Which should tell us everything we need to know about the game, and it's very true... asset flips wouldn't even be a thing if the stolen/plagiarised assets were attached to a fantastic game.  I mean, look at games like I Am Fish that use assets from the asset store... but they don't comprise most of the game.

Two notable criteria for what makes an asset flip instead of legitimate use of stock assets are whether those assets comprise the majority of the game, and whether the ""developer"" properly credited the people who created most of the assets in the game.  This game fails both of those tests.  The ""developers"" here didn't credit any of the artists and real, actual game developers who created the assets here, so this is plagiarism, as well as cash grab shovelware.

Despite not being in Steam Early Access (where this arguably belongs), the game is missing features and is apparently incomplete.  Due to the lack of meaningful progress from the developer, it's unlikely the game will be completed at all, yet the developers reprehensively have their hand out for money for an incomplete game.  This is a good reason for gamers to avoid this.

Taking this shovelware seriously as if it was a genuine attempt to make a game, it doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, left handed gamers or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

Mortos didn't appeal much to the people who own a copy of the game, either.  It has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game didn't really capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for starting the game, trivial to get, but less than 25 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  Hardly a success story, gamers just weren't all that interested in the game.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this only happened once, around the same time that trading cards were applied to the game... so this is just card idlers getting their cards and moving on.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

This game features a number of suspicious, likely fake positive reviews. The reviews all appear at almost exactly the same time, very shortly after the game launched on Steam, all have a direct Steam purchase of the game, and all have very similar wording and writing style (all in Italian, same as the developer, weird huh).  Immediately after this huge peak of reviews, reviews (and player counts) for the game dropped incredibly sharply.  This is highly unusual given the very low quality of the game and poor player counts.  The ""Positive"" review score on this game should be taken with a large grain of salt.  This might have been done to deceive/mislead gamers into paying for a bad product.

So, should you buy this game?  Is this one of the best of the 100,000+ games on Steam?

Mortos is relatively cheap at $1 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, and the questionable ethical nature of the developer and/or their associates (as outlined above), this is impossible to recommend.  Remember that if you buy a game from an unethical developer, you're putting your money at risk. ‚£ø‚£ø‚°ª‚†ø‚£≥‚†∏‚¢ø‚°á‚¢á‚£ø‚°ß‚¢π‚†ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£æ‚£ø‚°á‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚°ø‚°ê‚£Ø‚†Å ‚†Ñ‚†Ñ

Mortos is a survival shooter game where you survive against waves of zombies. I've complained about modern games not having enough hit registration but this is something else. There are no bullet tracers, no hit markers, no blood coming out of the enemies, there is NOTHING. You have 3 weapons, that being an SMG, a shotgun and a pistol and they all feel awful‚Äé‚Äé. Shooting at enemies does nothing because you have no clue where the bullets are going. At first I thought the game was headshot based, but quickly found out that was bullshit because headshots don't do anything. 

The game looks like it was made in 1999 and it's dark. To combat this issue the game has a night vision mode. The night vision mode is literally just all of the textures replaced with lime green. Not only is it disgusting to the eyes, but also takes any challenge out of the game.  AI is broken and they will often fall from the sky and the minimap doesn't accurately show where the enemies are. The incompetence of mortos is so high that they give you limited ammo, but then have these spiders follow you around the map. So you can shoot them and waste your ammo or you can knife them to death but risk taking damage. This is a decision that the player should have to make if they messed up and this is their punishment, not if they've played normally and followed all the FUCKING rules. it should come as absolutely no surprise, that baby's first video game is so bad, but goes to show how AWFUL this developer is, because they're not even capable of ripping off better games of this genre.

Soloing is possible but grouping is rewarded by better loot and experience. There are friendly veteran players that are very helpful. super fun, has a map well done This is a fairly polished old school MMO which launched in 2023 and has received frequent updates since.

I am a prior-to-Steam release player with 100s of hours.

Fantastic game that has plenty of adventuring, crafting, questing, grouping, and soloing fun.  This game starts off differently than other MMORPGs - it does not have a dedicated magic/caster class, and you start as a basic tank/dps/healer that does have further specializations later into deeper class mechanics, and adds ""magic"" in the form of alchemy at level 20.  In addition, all the classes/specializations have numerous abilities beyond their melee-only abilities that fall into magic casting areas.

The starting combat feels slow at first, and it took me a few hours to get it and understand the mechanics.  As you level you gain new abilities.  As you pick your class specializations, you gain new abilities.  When you obtain Alchemy, you gain new abilities.  All of this adds up to more complex combat outside the initial basic levels - but be warned:  higher level baddies also gain new abilities..... not just more HP/Damage.

Stick with this game until at least you obtain your specializations at level 6, and you at least move past the starter zone and the big city.  Group up and go into a dungeon.  Dive into an ember vein and explore.  There is A TON of content beyond the first zone.",0.08765008576329335

Nah just here want to thank the DEV which is Forgotten Empires, Tantalus Media, Wicked Witch and not forget our publisher Xbox Game Studios for making this game awesome and I love you guys. Keep it up with ideas and stuff. Make more orchestra since the music affect gameplay experience too. I play the game long since the expansion of age of king something until before buying the DE. Still remember each civ music. In DE, I think it got tinker a bit which is nice. Best listening this music when you got broken hard boi. After all, AoE2 DE will welcome you with scout rush and archer rush. Have fun and enjoy the game!! um guys???? where are the civ themes??? I bought this thinking the civ themes were here but they don't appear to be :/ My original copy of Age of Empires II didn't come with the music. My first time listening to the music was in the definitive edition and I really enjoyed it. I listen to it when playing the game or doing other things outside of the game. Why don't have Main Theme (Extended Mix)? As someone who played the original [i]Age of Empires II[/i] from 1999, I've had the music from that game firmly ingrained in my memory.

For the [i]Definitive Edition[/i], Masten has honoured the original music by making brand-new arrangements of it. The results are phenomenal and manage to be simultaneously nostalgic and excitingly new.

566540,Labyrinth of Refrain: Coven of Dusk,game,False,"18 Sep, 2018","RPG, Strategy","Beneath a small town lies an endless maze known as the Labyrinth of Refrain. Dusk Witch Dronya arrives, and with her puppet soldiers, endeavors to find something buried deep within. Embark on an adventure as you discover the secrets underground.","I know my way around RPGs, but this game has depths that I didn't even begin to scratch the surface of during my playthrough. While some of the dungeons can get pretty gross even for DRPG standards, this is a phenomenal pickup for the NISA and blobber fans out there. Enjoyable dungeon crawler with unique turn based mechanics, but does a terrible job at guiding players where to go or where to find certain items to progress the story Great story. Good gameplay. I enjoyed it. I love this series so much. This was such a great game. Such an amazing story.

If you have not played any of the two labyrinth games i suggest starting with this one as it is much shorter.

~50 hours for the normal ending and +10-20 hours for the true ending

The game is not very easy. The normal ending is generally doable but the true ending can be really hard so beware. There were multiple points where i wondered if i should just quit.

The story has some dark themes so also beware of that. The game has a solid start but over time the mechanics just become problematic. The whole ""gore"" system turns avoid into a must-have stat and any other defensive stats are nowhere near as useful. Everything about the gore mechanic just turns the late game into a slog. You'll spend too much time going through menus to disassemble or sell items for repairs. It's just a lot of unnecessary button presses. 

Most of the late-game maps are also just bad designs filled with enemies to pad out the play time.

TL;DR: Great early game, bad late game. Labyrinth of Refrain: Coven of Dusk is a grid-based Dungeon Crawler. As a magical book that can summon puppets, you travel through different realms, battle monsters, find treasure and, at certain points, continue the story in the overworld.

The story of the game is honestly pretty good, though it starts out slow and is a bit hard to understand at times. It's worth sticking with, though, even if it is told a bit too fast, or too slow, or too obscurely here and there. I ended up enjoying it more than I thought I would.

The problem, however, lies in the most important part - the gameplay. It is sadly very repetitive, with a lot of obscure stats, useless pacts (items you can slot your puppets into to gain access to skills) and bosses that you need certain pacts or items to defeat, but if you miss that information, good luck unless you just look it up on the internet because it will not be mentioned again. This is especially terrible with the final boss where you need a certain pact to even begin to scratch it and not die immediately, and how to get it (and that you even have to get it at all) is extremely hard to discern and player-unfriendly.

I was still going wrestling with myself on recommending the game up until that boss, but I think overall, I just can't really. Despite spending quite some time on it, I constantly went from moderately entertained to annoyingly frustrated, sometimes multiple times in the same dungeon floor. Enemies are annoying, because there are a lot of them and while you do eventually get a spell to avoid them, they still can easily run into you or just pop up in a one-grid wide floor. And battles are easy because most of the time you just put your puppets on auto battle or use aoe spells over and over. Only the bosses require a bit of tactics, and even then, brute force wins most of the time, which makes the few times it doesn't even more irritating. It's hard to tell just *why* you lost a fight. Do I need more resistance against the element attacks of the boss? Do I need to grind? Do I need to soul transfer to make my puppets stronger? Your puppet's stats are hard to read and equipment is too numerous and has too many stats to really tell what exactly would make your puppets stronger aside from the obvious strength or DP (think magic). It's complex for the sake of complexity, but it makes it all the much harder to play and have fun with.

The gameplay loop itself, at least, is entertaining most of the time because slowly uncovering the entire grid of a dungeon floor is just fun in most games that feature it. You find treasure chests, and locked chests you can only open with a key later but that usually contain powerful equipment, and grinding, while annoying at times, can be done faster with the Stockpile feature, so you at least feel a constant sense of (very slight) improvement. Only for the next boss to probably kill that sense of improvement immediately.

I don't know, to be honest - just like the game, I feel this review is all over the place. Overall, though, I just don't think I can recommend it unless you are a hardcore fan of grid-based Dungeon Crawlers who loves maximizing their characters even through some obscure, hardly explained systems. The story, at least, is somewhat worth it - if you can make it through the game surrounding it. It's much, much better than Mary Skelter (which I hated), but it's no Grimrock or Grimrock 2 (which I loved). It's off, somewhere, doing it's own thing, for better or for worse. i love the mechanics and gameplay, but the story and writing are awful. i just skip all the story. Solid dungeon crawler, story is pretty good and the art is a plus. Haven't finished the game yet but if things keep up like it is so far it'll definitely be worth the money. Long story short, I'm seriously enjoying this game. 

Short story long: 
I did not come into this title with high expectations. When I see NISA I think of Disgaea, which is well known for its solid game play mechanics and silly bland storylines that are there for the sole purpose of barely explaining why the game play is occurring. This game begins in a similar fashion. The characters seem simple and one dimensional, the art style is everything you're used to from NISA, the humor is simple and slapstick, with some minor ecchi gags thrown in very sparingly. 

The gameplay is solid without being particularly innovative. Breaking walls is a neat idea for the genre, and the concept is implemented well.  Combat strategy is mostly handled outside of combat.  Learning how to manage the right stats on the right characters is the key to winning 95% of your combats, and there is never really a situation that is so unexpected that you won't know exactly which commands to use in combat. This can make the game feel repetitive, but unless you're seriously overleveled, combat encounters are varied enough that some strategic decisions are made on the spot.  If you're getting bored you can increase the difficulty later in the game.  

Progressions systems are fairly similar to Disgaea (leveling characters, upgrading gear, reincarnation mechanics and such). It's simple, it's intuitive, and it's well executed. Basically it's everything I expected from NISA. 

With all of this I expected to go through this game at a leisurely pace without having to think too hard about what was happening. I certainly wasn't expecting the story to take the turns it did.  It was all fun and games...until suddenly it wasn't.  

Put simply, this story gets DARK.  If you're the kind of person that appreciates trigger warnings consider this review to be just that.  This story deals with some HEAVY topics, and by the end of it the narrative is complex, the twists are unexpected, the ""hidden"" lore is deep, the loose ends are all nicely wrapped up, and the emotional impact is significant.  I was fully invested in the story by the time it was over, and I think it's an experience that's going to stick with me long after I've moved on to other games.  

If you enjoy grid based dungeon crawlers but also want a great story then this is a must-buy. This is quite a bewitching piece of entertainment, one gets to be a part of. A rather mature, captivating story that unfolds as the adventure goes on.
Of course, I recommend playing with the original voice acting, for it is very delightful.",0.04742222566166224

Also, for those interested, playing a new game from a DLC deactivate achievments. Niffelheim Bloody Moon DLC Review

Bloody indeed; prepare for a long red night‚Ä¶ The moon is red and enemies aplenty!

Please note that this Review may contain spoilers from the Base game 

Some key points that this game add on has to offer:

1.	Fully upgraded workshops 
2.	No levelling system
3.	A Dragon from the start of the game
4.	No quests
5.	Very challenging experience. 

Replayability:

Niffelheim Bloody Moon DLC adds a new game mode to the list. Full on Survival. It still shares the same replay value as the base game.

Several changes were made to the game to increase the challenge that the game offers you. Along with that comes several benefits to help you survive. The days are shorter and the nights longer‚Ä¶, much longer. 

Here is a full list of changes made to the game:

‚Ä¢	Players have a dragon from the very start
‚Ä¢	No quests
‚Ä¢	No farms
‚Ä¢	Only a wooden castle that you can set on fire using your dragon!
‚Ä¢	No bots
‚Ä¢	The day is 4 hours long, whereas the night is 20 hours long
‚Ä¢	A lot less vegetation, all the trees are dry
‚Ä¢	All workshops fully deployed
‚Ä¢	No character development, just a handful of weapons
‚Ä¢	Spiders can poison you and skeletons can injure you
‚Ä¢	The dungeons are smaller, but there are still enough resources
‚Ä¢	Your castle gets assaulted 100% more often and there is only 1 chest and no vault!
‚Ä¢	The dragon burns everything except for mushrooms!
‚Ä¢	The city is closed and you cannot enter! There‚Äôs nothing to do there!
‚Ä¢	Spiders and skeletons run amok at night

Characters have abilities as default:

‚Ä¢	Warrior - Frugality 75%,
‚Ä¢	Valkyrie - Laborer 75%,
‚Ä¢	Berserk - StunBlockChance 75%,
‚Ä¢	Shaman - PoisonBlockChance 75%

MGR Gaming‚Äôs Conclusions:

Unlike Odin‚Äôs Blessing making the game more relaxed and easier, Bloody Moon does the exact opposite. 
As you can see from the above list. Ellada Games went above and beyond altering the gameplay mechanics, tweaking them to offer us a brand new thrilling experience.

There is no limit, no quests, it is all about surviving as long as possible. The workshops being upgraded to their highest level here is pretty much the biggest help, that and starting with your trusty fire breathing dragon. The perfect go to in a pinch! 

This DLC sells for such a low price, I urge you to buy it just to support the awesome developers, as for the DLC itself, it is more than worth it. Veteran survival players and Niffelheim fans will enjoy this one quite a bit!

Those that bought the game during its Early Access stage, will receive their copy of the DLC for free. Those that didn‚Äôt can still buy the DLC at a very low and affordable price.

2969380,BAKERU,game,False,"3 Sep, 2024","Action, Adventure",Bakeru's adventure begins in this Japan-esque Wild Action Game!,"Mario dual wielding bludgeons. I love this game. Well done port and an entertaining game most of the way through! I do think the game kind of drags on towards the end of it (an then just kind of ends) at least there's a lot of levels to go through. I encourage any Nintendo, Goemon fans or fans of Good Feel to support this release to let it be known that there's a market for developers like Good Feel on Steam so that we can get more games and other developers to bring their games here (I.E. to let other developers that (have) worked for Nintendo like HAL, Grezzo, etc that there is a market out there for their games here).

I know some have compared this to the Goemon games and while I see some similarities and enjoy those games a great deal I don't think its an apt comparison since a lot of it is mostly surface level comparisons imo. As far as gameplay is concerned its more akin to 3D World than a Goemon game. I think there's a lot of room for improvement (the story, gameplay loop, easy difficulty, retreads, level design etc) but for a debut game in this series, this is a good foundation. If there is a sequel I think ironiclly adding a couple more elements from the Goemon games (like having town hubs with NPCs and shops, coop, more level variety, more culture influence, etc) would be something I'd like to see. 

To address some of my complaints, the combination of the level design being very uninteresting and the game being generally really easy it can make going through levels back to back feel like a slog (and the idea of going back to find the hidden collectables feel like a chore). With there only being 3 types of levels it doesn't help the feeling of going through the motions. During the first part of the game I feel had a good pace with the story and levels but after that I feel the story takes a backseat and the later levels dont make up for it since it feels like more of the same. I'd honestly wouldn't mind if like almost half of the levels were cut or at least put aside as extra end game levels (cause honestly thats what they feel like). The Henge mechanic was a nice idea but since only one of them is a real transformation that effects traversing the levels while the rest are for combat, it feels really under utilized since once you get the fishing one there's really no reason to use the others 2. The difficulty makes this game feel like a baby game and Im sure thats what the target demographic was but as someone who has played a lot of good feels other games, I feel like they usually have something there for players who are looking for a challenge an its just not here imo. If it finding the collectibles then they missed the mark cause there's not much of a challenge finding them (for the most part). I think this game could have benefited from a hard/experienced mode cause the game gives you a ton of safety nets and it kind turns any challenge the game throws at you into a boring one. Despite all that I still enjoyed the game, I just wish it was more engaging for a player like me.


{Steam Deck notes}
I mostly played this on the Steam Deck and was very pleased with the performance of it both docked and handheld and I really appreciate the buttons glyphs matching whatever controller Im using (it even could detect if I was using a the Switch or Xbox layout). Bakeru is an interesting enigma, especially speaking from someone who did not play much of the Goemon games which this is very clearly derived from. What plays, feels, and looks like a remastered PS2 title, you‚Äôre tasked with beating the living Hell out of demons to the beat of your own drums to restore peace to the country land. You‚Äôll acquire various powerups called Henge that will allow you to hit from far distances, shrink down to access small passageways, and many others. Your gameplay loop is platformer to the core with collectables strewn about the levels to find, coins and energy dropped from enemies you spam light attacks against, and stumbling across secret Scoops with various facts and, uh, ‚Äúfacts.‚Äù

The issue falls primarily on if you don‚Äôt fuck with the loop, you‚Äôre going to lose yourself wanting to progress, because if you‚Äôve played 45 minutes of Bakeru: you‚Äôve played 10 hours of Bakeru. Even with all the additional power-ups and doodads that you find along the way, almost all enemies are handled with spamming light attacks and the occasional heavy to break guard. Bosses are pedestrian with very little resistance to just pummeling them to death without consequence. Bakeru just feels stretched so thin to provide maximum value that its amount of levels is more of a hindrance than benefit. They just start throwing characters that need to be saved in the middle of the game and I could feel myself withering away knowing they just added 15 more levels with that plot addition.

Bakeru isn‚Äôt a bad game per se, it‚Äôs just painfully unaware that a platformer of this caliber can be short and sweet without having to try everything in the wheelhouse to garner its popcorn moments. I put the game down a few months ago hoping some time away would spark some interest, but nothing is drumming up the desire to get back into it. 

[quote][h1]Follow [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33247611/]A Review Is Worth 1,000 Words[/url] for more Steam Reviews.[/h1][/quote] An abundantly charming game with a colorful cast of characters, bright and vivid levels to explore, and plenty of stellar gameplay variety, BAKERU was a game that I had once lost hope would ever be localized. Now that is actually has, I'm so grateful because it is a stellar game. Every level introduces and expands upon new ideas and concepts, brings with it impressive locales across a fairy-tale Japan to visit, and yes, that aforementioned gameplay variety keeps things fresh. 

Many levels are exploration and platforming-based, yes, but others will have you race in a cute canine robot, dogfight (quite literally) in that same robot within aerial battles, and also enter the cockpit of a massive teapot mech. The game is insane in all the best ways, bursting with creativity, clever level design, and engaging boss battles too. Highly recommended! Super fun 3D platformer / brawler with extreme japan energy. Also just genuinely one of the best looking games I've ever played. My only regret is that there weren't a few more challenging platforming bits, because it's definitely on the easier side. But still, this is an easy recommendation for fans of the genre. Just plain fun. Super charming and unique. If you fw PS2 era platformers you cannot miss this A great collect-a-thon game with a strong Goemon influence in its aesthetics. Hidden Gem and currently one of the best PC titles in its genre.
Lots of humor, great Boss fights, fun platforming , lots of variety and collectibles.

This game was only released for Switch and PC. want to have fun? its time to play bakeru
 This is a wonderful 3D platformer that's bursting at the seams with both charm and content.  You take on the role of Bakeru the tanuki and attempt to liberate Japan from an evil oracle who wants to subject the entire country to a never-ending demonic festival.  Along the way you'll meet new friends and pick up new transformations to help defeat the oracle's party-obsessed minions.

This game felt like a real labor of love from the devs.  This also just feels like a straight-up, fun platformer . . . for me, it had similar vibes to a 3D Mario game or Astro Bot.

Pros:
+ 63 unique levels.  All of them are quite big, and most of them are visually and thematically unique.
+ Three different types of (optional) collectables for you to find scattered throughout the levels.
+ It mixes up the gameplay (e.g. there are some racing, mech fighting, and space shooter levels).
+ There's a decent number of unique boss fights.
+Heavy focus on Japanese culture making for a unique experience compared to other platformers
+You'll be smiling the whole time playing this game

Cons:
-Walking towards the camera causes your character to slowdown instead of maintaining his speed. 
-Revisiting specific levels is a bit annoying towards the end due to the map layout/ travel mechanics.
-There probably should have been a few more regular enemy types. 

In short, if you're a 3D platformer fan this is definitely one you'll want to check out.  It's a great experience.",0.13236723461723462

Plus, you get to support the devs, so why not? üíú Great OST for great VN. Highly recommend, if you liked the game. [h1]Loving Highway Blossoms means loving the music as well, this is an absolute must to get.[/h1]

By buying this amazing soundtrack you'll get songs from artists like: Able Kirby, BAGman, Jake Abernathie, Kevin Turner, Sarah Mancuso and Smoke Thief in a total of 35 different songs in both FLAC and MP3, now that's a deal!

Country music, Rock, Jazz and other genres that I don't even know myself but they all give out such pleasent feelings and emotions that it matters little.
An absolute must of an purchase and even without a sale it's still so cheap, I bought it before I even finished the story, that's just how much I came to love it and normally I'm not even much for this kind of music!
And just like with the artbook, it's another amazing opportunity to support the developers.

Electric Shoehorn is the best track of them all, no doubts~ üíú A jarringly good soundtrack for a small indie VN. I dunno what black magic they did to have such a suberb OST, but I'm not complaining. Its the kind of soundtrack that's good regardless of what it's from, rather than being good in context of the game. Like I'd probably buy this album if it was just some standalone ambient album. That good. Good job, guys. Really good job. I often listen to it, especially hawaiian and salt. It's a pleasure to drive around with since I'm in the desert, really is good road trip music. The music was a big part of the game and still makes me feel a lot Perfect soundtrack for Highway Blossoms. The tracks were really good for setting the mood and tone of whatever scene was happening in the game. You just gotta love these emotional tracks. Still listen to it when feeling down sometimes. Absolutely phenomenal soundtrack. One of the best game soundtracks I have heard and worth the full price and even more.

I have been listening to it for hours since I bought it and I know for sure that it will stay in my playlist for a long time to come.

There is MP3 and FLAC version included and I'm so glad for the FLAC this time. I have Marina's Mixtape set to my alarm.

It's just [i] that [/i] fire!
and so are the other songs. This is honestly such an amazing soundtrack.

It does not work until you manually extract it from the local game files and start the ""Insanz DRTEST Home.exe"" as an administrator. 
Doing only that was already more fun than the original game, so I guess this DLC scored fully at improving the experience.
If you are one of the lucky few to actually run this you will see no change to the game. I have no idea where the screenshots on the store page are coming from, but since the game is literally unplayabe with so many glitched out parts you will not be able to pass you would never get far enough to witness the stunning effects of the Dr.Test DLC anyways... I am pretty sure you wouldn't even want to see them. 
(If anyone can ever prove me wrong on these then I will instantly lose my faith in humanity for containing an individual actually willing to try out InsanZ DLCs... That must really not ever happen.)

Don't wonder about the price. Since a few months ago this DLC will be add to your library for free if you purchase the standard game alone and I doubt they will ever have to be manually purchased anytime soon again. At least that's something. 

So overall this is nothing but some broken coding, but in fact still better than the game, so I rate up, whatever.",0.02752525252525252
1007910,Coloring Pixels - Patterns Pack,dlc,False,"18 Jan, 2019","Casual, Free To Play, Indie",Unlocks the Pattern themed book for Coloring Pixels. Includes 20 new optical illusion and pattern inspired levels to complete! Expect images designed to trick the eye and geometric patterns which are satisfying to complete.,"Didnt enjoy it as much as other packs, book 3 was more enjoyable than this i can see it being boring and painful for some (or most) people, but i kinda like it. 
i do recommend this pack; all the images are full squares(there are no empty spaces, meaning there are a lot of pixels to color which equals more content i guess) n plus, i like patterns.
^^ 1 - Honeycomb: Small, and there's only four colors so it's a very simple image.
2 - Spinning: Not difficult to finish, but the colors clash so hard it's a little painful to look at.
3 - Cubes: Rather dull, both in colors and in difficulty.
4 - Circles: Not a fun image to complete. You really have to scrounge for the pixels of each color.
5 - Geometric Fractal: It's okay. Not too difficult, but nothing to write home about.
6 - Rug: Another scrounging, not fun image.
7 - Metal Tiles: See image 6. 
8 - Sand: Another image with only four colors, but an incredibly tedious image to complete.
9 - Color Illusion: Probably the most fun image in the pack, to be honest. Long, simple, and very grey. Not bad to look at.
10 - Corners: More dull tedium, but at least it's kind of pretty.
11 - Scales: Not terrible in terms of completion, but overall it's just alright.
12 - Spiral: It's at this point in the pack I have to wonder if the person who made these images is a sadist.
13 - Beneath: Not exactly a 'pattern' but it's not bad to complete and it's a fun image.
14 - Dot Illusion: Easy but boring.
15 - Rainbow Weave: It's pretty to look at. That's about it.
16 - Line Illusion: Yet another tedious image to complete.
17 - Colorful Fractal: It's at this point in the pack where I know for certain the person who made these images is a sadist.
18 - Jigsaw: This one's genuinely a good image. Not boring to complete, and fun to look at.
19 - Kaleidoscope: This is actually awful. So. Much. Detail work. 
20 - Stars: Pain. Physical pain.

Overall thoughts: This is one of the few DLCs for this game I don't like. Most of the images are tedious and boring to finish, save for three somewhat pleasant images, and several downright painful ones. The only reason I'd say get this pack is if you want to 100% the achievements. Cool One of the better packs, though it does kind of get hard to stare at some of them I did not enjoy this pack at all, but I might have a bad relationship with repeated patterns. Well executed concept Generally better patterns that found in other packs so far. I thought the last picture was a bit too big and repetitive for its design, honestly, but pretty much all the rest were good. No real tiny puzzles here either, even the 50x50's are full-square puzzles. Not the greatest pack so far but one of the better ones. Puzzles are all very low quality in terms of complexity, difficulty, and enjoyment of solving the puzzles.  All of them are extremely monotonous, boring, and extremely easy to complete.  The third largest puzzle in this set, 220x220, I was able to solve in roughly 45 minutes or so.  With 42 different colors, I was expecting a lot more play time with that puzzle.

There is only one puzzle that I think will actually challenge me, and that is the largest puzzle, but with so few colors, even that puzzle, I feel, will still be very mundane to solve after a while.

I cannot recommend these puzzles to buy unless you are a completionist and want to get every achievement for this game. Welp, once again. :D FINALLY

1400180,Monster Girl Breeder,game,False,"18 Sep, 2020",Casual,"You settle in for a gaming session with the latest erotic fantasy game, suddenly you're whisked away to a fantasy world! Waking up in front of a horde of horny monster girls, its up to you to repopulate their isolated village!","I'll be blunt here. This VN really sucks. The translation is awful, phrasing and pacing are equally bad and it was not an enjoyable time. Only two things bring this up from being a total trash fire, but only barely. The price was low, a definite case of 'you get what you pay for', and the artwork was actually pretty good, even if more censored than honestly needed. 

If the creators would perhaps like to fix this total mess, may I first suggest eliminating the phrase 'meat toilet' from use? Following that, make use of a thesaurus. It's one thing to remain true to a translation, but another to make something that isn't a constantly repeating mess that frankly isn't fun to read. Im here for the monsters... the lady ones! Two words. ""Dick milk.""
Two MORE words. ""Meat toilet.""
Are you serious? This game is really rocky from the start- the main character is the most basic type- rude, not thought out, no personality other than ""horny and desperate"". All of the girls look pretty much the same, too- pale with big breasts. There's no differences in them hardly at all, minus the ONE, let me repeat, ONE girl of color. 
The MC is also a dick- like, I guess some people are into that, but the characters are all the same. It's just... sad. Definitely more like, worth two dollars than the ten it costs. And I STILL would have requested a refund. 
Don't waste your time or money. Interesting girls with cute voices (I like the Ogre best), but the story was quite lacking, considering it being in a fantasy world. Not really a game I just skipped the entire story looking for game but all i got was all the achievements Artwork is okay, plot of pretty bad and kind of boring. Man I love Monster Girls

Gosh I need to stop giving these people money this visual novel is not for the faint of heart. If you're into monster girls, anime, and explicit sexual content, then this is the perfect game for you. The story follows the protagonist who finds himself in a world filled with beautiful monster girls, each with unique desires. As the player, you get to explore and engage in sexual encounters with these creatures, building relationships with them.

The artwork is beautifully crafted (Although censored or just a road or tavern...) The music and sound effects add to the immersive experience, making the player feel like they are truly in this fantasy world railing these monster girls

The game offers a wide range of sexual encounters, from vanilla to more taboo. However, the game also offers the option to skip any sexual content that the player may not be comfortable with, making it accessible to a wider audience.

Overall, this visual novel is a must-play for anyone who enjoys anime and erotic content (As long as you are okay with it being censored more than the fcc censors the hell out of everything) . The storyline and character development are not there but come on, saying you are buying this game for the story is like saying ""Hey honey i'm gonna go run and grab a SALAD FROM MCDONALDS, or walking up to a hooker and paying for a hug... Either way the explicit sexual content is tastefully done, the moaning really did it for me, i was like a squirrel on meth for half of it...

TLDR: Authentic dosbox music does not quite make up for the odd custom ruleset of the chess game. No other game modes.

The game is straight from the DOS era. With heavy pixelization, somewhat delayed input recognition. This compounds with the tweaked rulesets of the game and the ease of making mistakes and clicking on invalid things.

Altogether it is slim pickings for the Battle Chess simulations. Perhaps Check VS Mate would offer a viable alternative but it is quite flawed.
https://store.steampowered.com/app/211070/Check_vs_Mate/ So far this is after one game - I'll update if anything is different after further games.  This is to the ancient game HnefTafl what Battle Chess is to Chess.  It gives a game played like HnefTafl with some variations on what you choose for special pieces, table, etc, but gives you little animated battles between the pieces.  However it is from the same time period as the original Battle Chess so very pixelated and at times difficult to see clearly on a modern screen.  But I enjoyed the game and appreciate having a Battle Chess version of this ancient game as well.  I look forward to trying it more.

I would recommend this for those interested in games like Battle Chess that don't mind the aged graphics and it running in Dosbox.",-0.06698412698412695

Can also integrate your own compositions and make more out of it I just prefer the looping as my laptop isn't the best for doing separate recording works but none the less a fine software for beginning composers and artists. Bad input lag.
Stuttery playback.
Analog Synth completely froze up while entering notes.
That's as far as I got before quitting to request a refund.
Worst DAW I've ever used. Even Mixcraft is better than this.
 I really like it. It's easy to put together tracks for just about anything. It has drum machines and sythisizers and not just one of each, there are multiple to choose from. It's a little glichy such as the sound bar getting stuck which you have to zoom out or in to get it to fix the ability to horizontal scroll. It's positives out weigh it's flaws, the leasrning curve is steep for this program, help menus do well to curb that somewhat.

I suggest using this program with Sony's Audio Studio.


 Magix Music Maker 2015 is a good tool in terms of ability especially for beginners. However when it comes to operating the software begins to lag no matter what after 10 minutes or so. I personally would not recommend the program because of this simple error. Also, the publishers of this program deserve no money if they can't be bothered fixing it. I used this software for a few days now it crashes all the time. I can barely get anything done in MAgix Music Maker. If you can buy a different DAW than this crap. The interface is not easy to use and writing your own music is harder than other DAW's I have use. Save your money buy something better. Personaly, this software is my favorite, and I also use th full versions of Ableton Live 9, and FL studio. Magix Music Maker also is very easy to use and can help you create good music! But do not get this sofware if you are looking to make dubstep music, (had lots of trouble with that). I think that house producers should buy this ~Pual the Sex Offender Fix the fucking bugs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And it crashes the shit out of me!!!!!!!!!!!! For some reason I can't get any microphones to work with this shitty program. 
I've read how tos on forums and watched youtube videos and i get nothing.

1431150,LongPath,game,False,"15 Oct, 2020","Adventure, Indie, Early Access",You accompanies the main protagonist in this action-packed 2D rogue lite on his quest.,"This game is similar to the retrogame Zelda of Nintendo. Not really worth it buying even for the low price.
No soundeffects, minimalistic graphic, and the whole game is only in 3 colours.
U can give it a shot if u want It's an insult to even call this a ""game"" but I will call it that to simplify this review. I'm only doing this so that other people such as yourself, don't get suckered into purchasing it, like I did.  

[Insert Long Breath Rant] Now answer me this. Have you ever played a game that was so terrible that you immediately uninstalled before you even had a chance to think about what it is that you are doing before you did it at an attempt to save yourself every last nano second of time that you spent wasting away playing that particular flavor of doo doo? Well that's this game. 

You can swing your sword and you can move your character using the D-Pad against a green tented background. That's the majority of the ""game"", with the occasional slaying of enemies, who's AI is worse than Anthem‚Äôs upon the initial release. You obtain health after walking several hallways until you get to mini boss events and if you defeat the challenge you awarded a heart piece, not be be confused with a heart container. Did I mention that A & B are swapped but B doesn't do anything at all? That's right, you can't; inspect, read, pickup, throw, jump, dash, bring up menus, check inventory, switch weapons, pause, etc.

I know it's EA but this isn't that. It's basically a placeholder that tries to trick folks into buying what appears to be a retro style Zelda game but it isn't that whatsoever. STEAM you are failing so hard in your QA/QC (not to mention a million other things but I digress). 

TLDR; Folks this is utter trash with some ok music. Trrust me whne I say, ""Hard pass on this!""

I will continue to monitor to see if the Dev (I can't imagine there's more than one) does anything with this. If they decided to do something with the game, I'll go back and alter my review to reflect as such. I am of the opinion that developers deserve all criticism of their poor products for releasing them in such a rubbish state. When devs do this, they saturate the market with junk that ""we"" the consumer, must then have to sort through, to find a sliver of a game worth playing. I'll be decent once the developer treats us with some decency. /end_rant

Unlock new events as you traverse the fearsome Kaldestan Chasm and save the city of Kaldesta again!,"absolutely zero nsfw content. not sure what happened but this version, like the princess project, lacks h scenes. Something rising in me when i hear her tsundere voices
And its definitely not my blood sugar (or might be)

It's very nice [h1]Expansion Review[/h1]  

Its rare for these types of games to receive a DLC.  Base game was decent but justifying another 10 bucks is really hard. 

[u]New content[/u] 
Now the ingame text is voiced by the heroine. Good addition in a game that already has such a high amount of quality in it with the very colourful and good art. Also new CG¬¥s by having a whole new ending/post game story that is very liniar though. Also some new standing art. Also some new scenes with another girl i dont care that much about.

[u] Conclusion/TL;DR[/u] 

For 10 bucks if you value the added voice acting and a new post credits ending it might be worth to buy. Atleast it was for me but just barely. I suggest picking it up on a sale. Don't bother buying the DLC (expansion), nothing new... Katrina who? Super-duper dlc. I really like to revisit old games and enjoy them once more. 6/10 how much do i like this? 
When the dlc was released on Dlsite i bought the game again just to play the dlc, that much.

The Curse of Kubel was so close to greatness and was being held up by just two things: a  need for a couple more CGs and the lack of both.

The addition of an epilogue of end C with new CGs,  new scenes with Katrina and full voice acting for Magetano , fix those issues.

Now i have my little personal nitpicks that while dont detract from the overall experience, they still annoy me:
[spoiler]
- END A still has an unnecesary low blow.
-the new epilogue for END C makes Magetano worse than in the fully corrupted END D, wich feel inconsistent since in both she indulges on non-stop sex with Bazria but in END D she shows to feel something when discovered by Cero while in epilogue C she doesnt seem to care about him anymore.
-Epilogue C makes a big deal about Magetano getting pregnat wich falls flat because you can see her literal child in end A

- Missed an oportunity pull an Undertale with Endings C and A. See when you finish a Genocide run in Undertale it corrupts you save giving you a bad ending even if you do the pacifist one.  This game could've pulled out something similar if it used properly the whole ""memory of Magetano getting pregnante being  permanent"". If you dont have the memory you get a proper happy ending with no brown kid but if you get the ""pregnant memory"" you get Bazria child in ending A. You could trick them by allow them to lower Magetanos depravity even after completing the ending.

This only makes END C more significant but also rewards those players that went for the pure ending first.
 [/spoiler]

Still a great a adition that allows the original to realize its potential, for the most part. There was an issue with the v2 patch. Not all audio was properly packed. Patch v4 fixed the issue.

Slightly disappointed that not all female character has audio. But all the main protagonist dialogs and reactions are covered. I am happy. A must have, and would like to support the developer. ‚¢∏‚†â‚†â‚†â‚†â‚†â‚†â‚†â‚†â‚†â‚†â‚†â‚†â‚†â‚°∑‚°Ñ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä

I commanded my ship to come into range, during that time my sailor was informed he was now a father. With now more guilt on my mind I pressed onwards with my ship. We fired the first torpedo, was a dud, second a dud, third a dud, fourth was a hit but its too late. Their ships are pressing onto me and I begin to dive. I got to 30 meters before the first depth charges come in. Was a critical hit in the stern. My new father onboard was knocked out, I had 3 leaks in the stern and more charges coming. A few moments later another charge hit the office quarters, I have now lost power to half my ship and we are taking on water fast. In last ditch effort to escape I ordered us to rise to the surface. Yet my kept going down. My hope was peril and my crew was wounded and unfunctional as we sank into the depths of the North Sea.

You steal precious data while the world sleeps.,"Been playing since 2015 but mostly played offline on my laptop hence the few playtime. finally beat it in 2025 hah. but ive always enjoyed it. simple and fun, nice quick play for a bit kind of game. Very fun game. An amazing game for short sessions. Like someone turned a classic arcade game into a rougelike. Accurate simulation of being inside a computer. It's deeper than it seems. yes! I return regularly to this fantastic game and I can't believe it got less than 100 reviews, so here is one more.

A gem of minimalistic game design, 868-Hack delivers a stripped down, tense ""Roguelight"" experience on a series of 6x6 grids where you have to guide an avatar to the exit while getting rid of an increasing number of adversaries and collecting score if you dare (doing so brings more enemies). Every move is a tough as nails decision where you have to balance resource collecting and management, risk taking, and positional tactics. The large number of possible upgrades (with a maximum of 8 you can get on a given run) makes for the so-called rogue-style experience where you have to improvise in each run a viable and balanced set of powers from what is thrown at you in order to beat the tougher levels and hopefully gather a higher score. The base mechanics are easy to grasp, but you have to experiment to notice some edge effects and interesting synergies between the upgrades. What I appreciate in the minimalistic approach is that you don't need to keep in your mind an entire encyclopaedia of powers, rules and enemies to get good: it is fairly easy to have a good overview after a couple of hours. The elements are simple, but the combinations are always varied and bringing new challenges (when you start getting too good, the game starts throwing more gameplay hindrances at you). Finally, the very simple graphics and sound effects make for a surprisingly unique atmosphere. One of my favorite games! 868-Hack is brilliant in its simplicity and strategic depth. I watched a few videos and didn't really understand the hype until I played it. And yes, I think it lives up to the hype.

You are a smiley face. You run around and activate squares that give you points (your main goal) but run the risk of spawning enemies as well. Some of the enemies can be quite brutal to deal with, but some squares give you active abilities to deal with them. You need one of two resources (sometimes both!) to use them, and thus the analysis paralysis sets in. Do I go for this ability to target all of these enemy types? Do I run the risk of activating 5 enemies to get this point bonus? There's only 8 stages in a run, but by that final stage you are sweating bullets trying to puzzle out how you're going to stop the cyber monsters from swarming you.

It works surprisingly well on the steam deck to boot. At the end of a long day when you're brain is all used up, you fire up a game of 868-Hack thinking ""ah this will be a nice relaxing experience to cap the night off with"" and by level 8 you're in a cold sweat, viruses and daemons breathing down your neck as you try to struggle out the mental calculus of how to get to the exit with only enough energy to run two abilities. You did it. You survived and escaped. But now do you dare push your luck and try to increase your streak? A classic 868-HACK is one of my favorite games ever!

Home, James, is a movie about James, an Aspiring photographer, James, and a drinker, Cooper, they both meet.
Everything is great in the story, except for one conflict, James want's to stay in Tulsa, Oklahoma, while Cooper wants to move to Brooklyn, New York City. The way they show they love for each other, but at the same time share this difficulty is 
greatly shown in this movie. For .59 cents its a great movie to be watched, for full price, the rental is also very worth it. It's a great movie, and should be one to watch if you like emotional movies. I really enjoyed it.
9/10 A gripping roller-coaster, romantic, emotional indie film. Well worth the money. If something is indie, it¬¥s not automaticly good. The movie starts in a great way, has beautiful scenes. At the beginning they show this fantastic, ambitious girl, but at the end she mutates somehow into a dull, hedonist alcoholic. It¬¥s like the creators wanted to make us hate her, just because she doesn¬¥t obey to the will of the protagonist. The focus on the protagonist¬¥s perspective on the things becomes also too strong in the last half, that¬¥s why the movie loses rapidly its complexity. The trailer promisses a reflection on the problems of the young adults, but the movie gives just another ""Girl leaves a guy - story"". Amazing movie 10/10.
But i didnt liked the end though. Amazing Film
a must to buy film! 
 A very good and inspiring indie movie.
I can feel the director expressed a very deep affection to his, or her maybe, hometown Tulsa, Oklahoma, which from the movie is a very lovely place.
And the soundtracks of it is great. A little cliche but heartfelt and sincere. A beautiful indie film that, while not the most groundbreaking, is full ouf heart and soul. Definitely worth a watch, or two. I know I'll be watching it again!

[h1]Ryan George Style Pitch Meeting: ""Packed Train""[/h1]

Game Designer: So, you have a quirky little puzzle game about cute creatures and a train for me?

Publisher: Yes, sir! I do!

Game Designer: Alright, so imagine this: you‚Äôre packing cute, squishy little creatures of all shapes and sizes onto a train. It's simple, fun, and you‚Äôll keep coming back for more!

Publisher: What?

Game Designer: What?

Publisher: Well, okay then! So, what exactly do you do in this game?

Game Designer: Oh, it's super simple! You just take these adorable creatures‚Äîshapes like squiggly little blobs and weird cubes‚Äîand you pack them onto the train. But here‚Äôs the twist: it‚Äôs a puzzle game! You gotta figure out how to fit ‚Äòem all in. It‚Äôs like playing Tetris, but with adorable creatures and trains!

Publisher: Very considerate! So, the game‚Äôs a puzzle where you fit the creatures onto the train. How do you make it interesting?

Game Designer: Well, let me tell you: every level is a new challenge! You get to move creatures around, resize them with power-ups, and watch them squish into place like a jigsaw puzzle of pure cuteness. The levels get harder, but in a fun way‚Äînot one of those ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna cry and give up‚Äù ways. It‚Äôs addictively satisfying!

Publisher: Well, okay then! What makes it different from other puzzle games?

Game Designer: Well, unlike other puzzle games, this one is just SO CUTE! It‚Äôs like if you were solving puzzles while being hugged by a fluffy cloud. It‚Äôs that adorable. Plus, there‚Äôs something oddly relaxing about packing creatures onto a train while hearing chill background music. You‚Äôll want to do it all day!

Publisher: Wow wow wow. Wow. So, how does the game actually play?

Game Designer: So the goal is simple: you take creatures, pack them onto the train, and make sure you have room for everyone. The catch? The train‚Äôs only so big, and the creatures come in all sizes. You need to think carefully, but it‚Äôs not frustrating‚Äîit‚Äôs like a calm, fuzzy challenge that makes you feel like a puzzle master. And the best part? You can move ‚Äòem around with power-ups! You can resize ‚Äòem, squish ‚Äòem, and give ‚Äòem their own little space!

Publisher: Very considerate! Sounds like a very cozy experience. How long are the levels?

Game Designer: Some are quick, some take a bit longer, but the cool thing is, there‚Äôs no pressure! It‚Äôs like a cozy train ride where you just... vibe. Each level‚Äôs got its own little vibe‚Äîcute, chill, and fun. Perfect for unwinding after a long day.

Publisher: Well, okay then! So, what‚Äôs the ultimate goal here?

Game Designer: Well, you keep solving puzzles and filling up trains, but it‚Äôs not about winning or losing‚Äîit's about that sweet, sweet satisfaction of packing everything in just right. You‚Äôre like the most efficient train conductor ever. The puzzle‚Äôs complete, the creatures are happy, and you‚Äôre just vibing. It‚Äôs the ultimate feeling of accomplishment!

Publisher: Wow wow wow. Wow. So what‚Äôs the vibe? Is it relaxing or stressful?

Game Designer: Totally relaxing! You‚Äôre not stressing about time limits or failing‚Äîjust stacking creatures and listening to soft music while the train chugs along. It‚Äôs like a peaceful little journey every time you play!

Publisher: Well, okay then! Sounds perfect for winding down, but are there any challenges?

Game Designer: Oh, for sure! The levels get trickier as you go on, so you‚Äôll have to think more about how to organize the creatures, especially when the train fills up. But it‚Äôs never unfair‚Äîit‚Äôs all about being clever with your space and power-ups. A perfect balance of challenge and fun.

Publisher: Alright, I‚Äôm sold! I love me some adorable creatures and chill train vibes.

Game Designer: Great! Let‚Äôs do this. Choo choo, motherpackers!

[h1]Dishonest Trailer: Packed Train[/h1]

In a world where trains are supposed to be organized‚Ä¶ comes a game that will make you wish you‚Äôd never seen a tetronimo in your life.

Get ready for Packed Train, the game where you attempt to fit sentient blocks into an already overcrowded train and fail spectacularly! Forget efficient travel; this is all about shoving your problems into tight spaces and hoping they don‚Äôt explode into pure chaos.

Choose your own disaster and watch as your train gets progressively more ridiculous, like a clown car full of overenthusiastic, block-shaped passengers. Think you're good at Tetris? Wrong. Think you can organize these tetronimoes? LOL nope.

Experience the thrill of:

    >Shoving blocks into spots that you KNOW don‚Äôt fit but doing it anyway because why not?

    >Trying to plan your moves, only to realize every decision you make is a step closer to blockpocalypse.

   >Watching the train get increasingly more packed, and by ""packed,"" we mean a hot mess of desperate, squished tetronimoes and regret.

    >Becoming best friends with your conductor, as they silently judge your stacking skills with every clattering train stop.

Packed Train: It‚Äôs a game where spatial awareness and order take a backseat to chaos, anxiety, and, occasionally, screaming. Will you manage to shove those last few tetronimoes in, or will you be buried in the wreckage of your bad decisions?

Packed Train: Because why just ride a train when you can watch it collapse under the weight of your mismanagement?

[hr]

In a world where trains are packed with squish,
Creatures of all shapes and sizes, make a wish.
They're blobs, they're cubes, they roll and they slide,
They'll squeeze and squish, with nowhere to hide!

Power-ups galore, resize them with flair,
Squish 'em, stack 'em, and fill up the air!
The train's on a journey, with creatures inside,
But oh no‚Äîspace is tight, don‚Äôt let them collide!

No stress, no sweat, just puzzle-filled bliss,
Each squishy block‚Äôs a sweet, blocky kiss.
It‚Äôs not about winning, it‚Äôs just about fun,
Pack 'em in tight, 'til the day is done!

The train‚Äôs always moving, no time to slow,
Creatures get squishier as you go!
Stack ‚Äòem, stretch ‚Äòem, or make them small,
Pack ‚Äòem in tight‚Äîwho cares about space at all?

In this packed-up world, just do your best,
Squish those tetronimos, forget the rest!
So grab your ticket and hop on the train,
Let the chaos begin‚Äîit‚Äôs the cutest brain strain! Packed Train is, well, very likely to be an asset flip.  At face value we can see ""Packed Train"" is a mobile app (that isn't on app stores, immediately raising suspicions) where you drag and drop Tetris blocks onto a flatbed train carriage.  Pretty shallow stuff and beneath gamers valuable attention right there, but there's more.  See, the game itself is internally titled ""Farm Train"" by the Polish developers, Ice Code Games, but that's not this game.  Huh.  Is ""Games Games"" an alt account for Ice Code games?  If not, then we know this is an asset flip.  There's also the matter of the game manifest containing Unity assets from the asset creator, ShaderQuest.  Of course the ""developers"" behind this credit neither ShaderQuest or Ice Code Games, so it's pretty obvious something highly suspicious is going on.  As always, if it looks shady, it probably is, and my advice is always for gamers to be cautious with their purchasing decisions and stay safe.  There's a lot of unethical developers out there, pushing bad products onto gamers to make a quick buck.

Even if this isn't an asset flip, it has all the same qualities as asset flips, it's shallow, looks like it wasn't designed for PC, feels more like a demo or tutorial than a real game, etc etc.  That alone is enough reason for this to be unrecommendable. 

Well, here's my boilerplate stuff for all the defects that affect this game, if you should decide to take it seriously: 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics. 

The game features lazy low-polygon ""retro"" assets, making this look like a barely functional 3D game from the mid 2000s.  It's unclear why the developers weren't able to arrange high quality, high polygon count contemporary assets for the game, and also irrelevant... what matters is that this looks bad as a result of their decisions, a compromise PC gamers shouldn't have to put up with.

The controls can't be customised because the game has such a dumbed down, simplified interface that it's just iPhone screen tapping stuff.  The fact that the interface is this dumbed down might be seen as a problem in itself, however... this is a fairly shallow experience if you're the kind of gamer that likes to play games with deep, rich control schemes and interaction.  You'll get none of that here.

This looks and feels like a mobile app, but it doesn't seem to have made it to the app stores.  It's unclear why this was put on Steam instead of the app stores it seems to have been designed for.  Maybe it was removed, maybe it was rejected by Apple and Google (they do have more rigorous quality standards than Valve does for Steam, after all).

Regardless, for all intents and purposes ""Packed Train"" might as well be a mobile app, it has the same limitations and dumbed down qualities.  It's impossible to recommend such a game to PC gamers.  We don't spend all this money building gaming rigs so we can pretend they're iPhones and play games that might as well be mobile apps.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 4 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

Packed Train is relatively cheap at $2 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.
 pretty cool friendly cute chill game is like a combination betwin a match 3 and tetris is a neat concept i really recommend this one if you like this kind of colorfull relaxing puzzle games I think this would be a great game for kids.
Very simple to learn, rather easy to master.
The visual style is very much child friendly.
And It is just nice overall, simply enjoyable.
Some adults might also get a kick out of it.
Just a neat little casual arcade time waster.
The default price of this game is quite tiny.
And It simply is a perfect gift for your kids. 
It only requires a mouse. So easy to teach.
This game seems to lack windowed mode.
But that won't matter much to young kids.
I have to give this game: a positive review.
Definitely worth the asking price, for sure.
I'm pretty sure it was all designed for kids.
Perfect for 1st grade in terms of difficulty.
There's also a 'challenge mode' available.
Which might be suited for like 3rd grade.
Dunno, depends on the skills of your kid.
But It's definitely worth buying for them. Yep, it's cheap. Yep, it's kinda fun for a while. Yep, it's cute...in a weird way. Haven't seen hide nor hair of the Steam Leaderboards touted on the game's page. Seems to be only one, yes, a whole ONE puzzle to complete via words even though in the game there's a place to click where you can supposedly see your comleted puzzles...as in plural. Two questions asked in the forums (whew, that's gotta be a record low for any game that's been out for 3 months) and neither with a shred of response from developers. Can a developer answer in shreds? No idea. If there was a rating for MEH I'd choose that. Really fun puzzle game.  Excellent game.",0.06373020710066558

Or play with a monster skin, just for fun! Play with others whether or not they own this DLC.","A DLC that expands Barony with 4 more classes and 4 more races.

These include:
Skeleton(Race)/Conjurer(Class): Skeleton doesn't need to eat, so you can take as much time as you need (watch out if you polymorph, tho, since hunger comes back if you do). HP and MP regen are 25% the normal rate, so watch out. Can recruit Ghouls and Automatons (Not other skeletons, so don't try it). The conjurer is a magic oriented class that summons skeleton allies to aid him in battle. The more they defeat, the stronger they become. 
Vampire(Race)/Accursed(Class): Vampire starts with 2 powerful spells, Levitation and Bloodletting, and can transform HP into MP if magic runs out. You can only feed with blood, however, and water burns. Can recruit Vampires and Automatons. Accursed class is a speedrunner's dream. A strong spell that you can't de-activate that gives strong starting stats, but hunger burns away very quickly (at x5 speed), so you better bolt it!
Succubus(Race)/Mesmer(Class): Succubus gain buffs from cursed equipment and can be unequipped if needed and can't unequip blessed items (they still get the benefits, however), and they start with both Teleportation, and Polymorph spells. Can recruit Succubi, Incubi, Automatons, and drunk or confused humans. The Mesmer class is a magic oriented class that charms enemies to make them fight for you. Specially strong if you can charm and level up named NPCs.
Goatman(Race)/Brewer(Class): Goatman doesn't know how it's got here. You wake up and have a hangover, which you can cure by drinking booze, which also boosts STR/CHR/AC. Can eat tin canned food without an tin opener by eating the tin can directly, and fountains have a chance of giving aditional potions. Can recruit Goatman, Automatons and drunk Humans while you're also drunk. Brewer is a class that focuses on Alchemy. By brewing powerful potions, you can deal big damage to enemies, heal allies, sneak around, paralyze enemies, etc.

Naturally, all of these being monster races, they'll make shopkeepers and humans attack you on sight, so watch out for that.
To play with the DLC classes as other races, you must first beat the game as class with the associated race.
Really fun DLC that expand Barony more. Funny skeleton . This DLC deserves an award just for the last two pictures in the store page! Skeleton is best class in game, trust.

389170,Songs for a Hero - Definitive Edition,game,False,"24 Mar, 2016","Adventure, Casual, Indie",A classic platform with a twist: A dynamic soundtrack and funny lyrics that sings the player's actions and responds to what is happening during the adventure.,"Well made, fun platformer, great concept. I laughed. Como diria uma pequena pessoinha que conheci: ""√â indefect√≠vel"". Top! 100! Great game for everyone willing to play a cool platformer with engaging and funny songs Had fun in the start of the game, as the game progresses, the singing becomes very monotonous and boring. The stages doesn't feel that fun, every stage looks the same but with a different color, feels repetitive. Songs for a Hero is a generic platformer that is a waste of time and misuses its one gimmick.

The gameplay is very simplistic to start: Jump, swing sword, and use shield to block. There are 9 worlds consisting of typically 3 levels plus a boss. You gain some new powerup for worlds 1-7 such as charging up to shoot a fireball from your sword, invisibility, swimming, dash, etc. You have lives in this, but enemies, environments and bosses are so non-challenging that you'll rarely die unless you're searching for secrets and get insta-killed in some manner. I had 40+ by the end.

The main gimmick of the hero singing to what you're doing is exaggerated, overdone and not utilized properly. By the time you finish the first world, the singing will mostly be background noise that you'll barely pay attention to while you're platforming or fighting. Most of the time the music is about 1 of 3 things: Something about the current environment of the world you're in, seeing a new enemy for the first time, or something about finding the princess. Typically, the only times the music will be about something you're doing is if some enemy hits you or you land on spikes/environmental object, The music should have been done in a humorous way but most of the time is not. The lyrics are pretty bad and I don't think I laughed a single time while listening. It would've also helped to find a better singer.

There's not too much to complain about other than how generic this all is. You've done all these things in much better games that were far more challenging and rewarding. Of annoyance, there were two spots during the game where there were secrets I could go get but a cutscene triggered and then during the cutscene the hero decides to jump down a pit that there is now no way to go backwards from. One is right after getting the swimming ability which means you'd be forced to replay the level if you want to go swim through the water segments prior to that to get whatever was hidden there.

To further add to the complete lack of challenge and is insulting to the player is that every single level is covered in signs pointing in the direction you're supposed to go or with a skull and crossbones over a pit indicating not to jump into it. Why? Do the makers of this think this is the first platforming game made in the history of videogames and that players will have no idea what to do if there aren't signs everywhere indicating where to go? Was this game made for mentally r3tard3d people? There will be spots with a sign with a down arrow on it right before a ledge and you can clearly see the platform below on your screen and there's no where else to go.

Songs for a Hero is a mediocre generic non-challenging platformer with a wasted and often annoying gimmick. music I'm flabbergasted, this game is WAY MUCH BETTER than i expected. The songs are too good, fun story, real fun gameplay and it's retro looks give a good nostalgia. Come on non-brazilians, give it a try, the english translation is AMAZING, I just had to replay it in english just to listen to it. Unique game.

Just find ËÆæÁΩÆ in the menu, and then change the language arrow to English. For some reason I had to do this every time I started up the game. 
Gameplay: Mostly a series of cutscenes revolving around an undercover cop who's the right hand man in a gang. There's not a lot of romance, but quite a lot of bad choices that can lead to a quick end. In addition, there's not a lot of comedic content, but it's mostly serious and dark in nature, with a fair bit of violence. The suspense and psychological tension that the MC undergoes (illustrated by the spacey time-lapses and loss of focus by the MC's point of view many times) plays a big part in adding to the drama of the story 
It's not a bad game, but I guess, the less smooth scene navigation, slightly confusing paths, and the violence could make it less appealing for those that came here only to play dating sims. It also has one plot and one scene that I still can't figure out how to unlock, and the game might be broken there. But it you like intrigue, plot twists, under cover operations, and the option to choose ""questionable"" morality choices then this game is for you. You can be a good guy, or a ""bad guy"" that's really a good guy - it's all in your hands.
And to top if all off, it's only $2, so the couple hours worth of gameplay more than makes up for any annoyances you might experience. And it has English subs! For a $2 game that's pretty good. At first glance, the game seems quite decent. It supports English, although it‚Äôs strange that this isn‚Äôt mentioned on Steam, which could be confusing for potential buyers. There‚Äôs no 4K or 2K resolution support, which might be a letdown for players who prioritize high-quality visuals. The total runtime of all scenes is about two hours, which is adequate for exploring the main character‚Äôs storyline.",0.050388726919339155

And there are a lot of places on all the tracks for oyu to go off the track or hit somethig on the side and be done with the race.
Why would the devs build tracks that arent clearly defined? Then add to the fac you can hit things on the side of the track and ruin your race? How about tracks with walls? if you hit a wall youll lose speed and time but at least you know where to actually go?
F this game. fun  This game is not worth $40. I do not understand why they keep raising the price. However My friends and I bought it for around $20 and we have sunk hours and hours together in Hot Seat and the campaign is great. Hands down the best arcade racing game on steam. The only two reasons aside from the price that this would receive a negative review is the lack of online multiplayer and the constant prompts from Ubisoft to sign in. I just want to turn my PC on, launch the game and play together. Not mess around with your stupid third party accounts or whatever. Take that out that BS and I will make this review positive. UPlay is the worst, most garbage piece of software I've ever had to try and use. To actually get the game to work:

1. Uninstall UPlay
2. Install latest version of Ubisoft Connect

Actual game is fine if you can get it to work. Excellent performance, gorgeous visuals, and plenty of difficult tracks. The problem is, as always, Uplay. Game is fun, but the required Uplay (now Ubisoft Connect) that comes with the game is so out of date, it cannot auto update itself, and therefore cannot launch the game unless you manually install it. Once again, pirates get a better experience than the people who actually buy the game.

Other than that, the game is great. Plays amazing, and somehow looks better than Trackmania 2020. Highly recommend if you're okay dealing with Ubisoft's BS. Leave it to Ubisoft to ruin a good thing.

Highlights 
1. We can purchase the game via steam but to play it we need Ubisoft App (let that sink in)
2. Downloading Custom Maps is a joke now now. A real joke on the paying customers. (You have to try it to believe it, its so haphazardly put together system and it barely works.)
3. Online Servers are slow and cumbersome to join and Totally Empty.
4. Annoying ""Diverse"" Voices during races makes my head and my car spin out of control.  (You know you can select your language in other games why pull this diverse joke Ubisoft why)
5. Menus are totally incompetent and confusing. (Menus inside Menus inside Menus inside .............)
6. Its Ubisoft ruining our favourite racing Series
7. Trackmania (2020) is a subscription based scam riddled with adware and bloatware and god knows what else. 
8. UBISOFT CONNECT (BLOATWARE)

I'd recommend it only to get a bit of lore but you get it in other games in the series too. If you love well written stories and captivating characters this game is for you, loved this game since forever so glad I was able to find it again :) It's ok, it's an old game and it feels that way when you play it.
Sometimes the controls are a bit tricky, but it's playable.
Buy with discount =) Honesty this was nightmare, not only you can't go full screen you cant play well, there is thin layer between inventory and going back on next room.. the inventory keeps hovering on and off makes you accidentally go back sheesh! Fun game to beat in under 4 hours GOOD :D I'm giving this game a neutral thumb. I got so irritated by the lack of a map and constant backtracking. The story is not the best either. You are playing with a woman who has a twin sister who vanishes on her wedding day, some witnesses say a dark figure pushed her into the river but her body was not found. You drove to the mansion where you grew up before your sister took it. You noticed it is almost looking abandoned before a demon shows up in front of you to help you find your sister. You carelessly make a pact with the demon and dive into your sister's memories to understand what exactly has happened to her. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2971707712

There are six chapters in the game, whenever you dive into a memory, you'll go to a different area and collect some evidence before going back to the mansion and using whatever item you obtained from the memory. the gameplay is like any hidden object game, but since this is a classic game, it is heavy with hidden objects scenes and puzzles, the puzzles are unique however, and not boring. 

The music is almost none existing, and if it ever plays it is the same track looping over and over, I didn't enjoy it at all, the game sounded quiet most of the time. The journal is good, it gives an additional explanation to the story but I still don't understand how the two sisters separated at a young age and why the main character left. how can she survive alone at the age of 13? Why the twin sister Luisa needs to stay with the nanny while the main character doesn't?

The artwork is good, some of the areas look amazing with all the details. unfortunately the screenshot button not working with this game, I had to follow a workaround method to upload them. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2971707649

Pros:
+Beautiful visuals and location design.
+Lots of hidden objects scenes.
+Beautiful and useful journal keeps track of the story.
+Variety of original puzzles.

Cons
-Some plot holes.
-No fast traveling map.
-No Steam achievements.
-Almost no music in the game.
-No voice-overs.

Sometimes I wish games don't have bonus chapter like this one which doesn't add anything to the story, in fact, you'll wonder why it happened, why they sold the house when they know what is inside of it. Anyway, I only recommend this game if you enjoy classic hidden object games or the series of Grim Tales which I'm planning to play all of it.

TLDR: IF YOU CAN HANDLE THE MOTION SICKNESS, GET THE GAME. IF NOT, DO NOT BUY Holy S#it !!! This is one of the scariest games ever. It stays tense and builds from there! If you are a fan of horror games BUY THIS! The game's standout feature is its gameplay. It‚Äôs exciting to see developers introduce unique mechanics that work exclusively in VR. Although the movement felt a bit clunky at first, I quickly got the hang of the wheelchair mechanics after a few minutes of practice.

The game presents some well-designed set pieces, with the fourth chapter being my favorite so far. It was also the longest chapter, making it the highlight of the experience. For the developers, this chapter could serve as a strong reference for future projects. While the other chapters had their enjoyable moments, they felt somewhat repetitive and noticeably shorter in comparison. By the time I reached chapter three, I could already predict that the next objective would involve finding a keycard to unlock the following door.

I also really liked the enemy designs. They enhanced the atmosphere and made encounters more engaging.
 Overall, ""Deadness"" is a thrilling action-adventure indie game that offers a captivating storyline, challenging gameplay, and visually striking graphics. With its blend of exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat elements, as well as its dark and atmospheric setting, ""Deadness"" is sure to provide an unforgettable gaming experience for fans of action-adventure titles. 
Wow, Deadness is a true survival quest! Picture waking up in an abandoned lab complex, no memory, stuck in a wheelchair, and surrounded by hellish creatures. You've got to navigate this nightmare, dodge zombies, and solve puzzles to stay alive. The controls are realistic yet intuitive, but they also make you feel utterly helpless. It takes cunning to evade those monsters. The story unfolds through audio tapes, adding depth to the terrifying atmosphere. And yeah, it's not just a game‚Äîit's a plunge into genuine horror, where you're face-to-face with your own fears. This is my first horror game in virtual reality. Interesting plot, very scary jump scares. A very cool movement system with feedback to the joysticks. You play as a person in a wheelchair, which gives a new experience, as it is conveyed very realistically. There are no graphics settings, but I had no problems with optimization, although my computer is quite old. The storyline kicks off with a perfect blend of mystery and horror, waking up in a wheelchair with no memory of who you are or why you're in this nightmarish place. The screams echoing in the distance and the unnerving ambiance set the stage for an unforgettable experience.
Survival is not just about firepower; it's about strategy and wit. Deadness requires players to outsmart the terrifying creatures that inhabit the facility, using every means necessary to stay out of their sight. The tension is palpable as you navigate through rickety planks, dodge swinging corpses, and confront inhospitable environments that add to the overall sense of dread. Simulator wheelchair invalid , by the way, because of the scrimmers I recommend immediately play sitting on the toilet. 
In general pleasant graphics, not straight that would wow!!! But nevertheless, I understand this is the first project of this studio, I put 5 points. 
Very reminiscent of the game outlast, I think they are quite similar, but I have not found any passhaloka on this topic, unfortunately. Deadness is an immersive horror game that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world infested with zombies. With its realistic graphics and intense gameplay, players are put in the shoes of a survivor who must navigate through dark and eerie environments while fending off hordes of undead. The game also utilizes virtual reality technology to provide a truly terrifying and immersive experience, making every encounter with the zombies feel incredibly intense. With its atmospheric soundtrack and gripping storyline, Deadness is a must-play for fans of horror games looking for an adrenaline-pumping experience. Deadness takes the survival horror genre to new and thrilling heights, delivering a truly immersive and terrifying experience that will keep players hooked from start to finish. As a fan of the genre, I was blown away by how effectively the game manages to create an atmosphere of dread and tension.

Overall, Deadness is a standout title in the VR survival horror genre. Its exceptional visuals, captivating storyline, and addictive gameplay combine for a truly unforgettable experience. If you're a fan of the VR horrors, this game is an absolute must-play. Don't miss out on this game - it's well worth your time!",0.0744781399775819
2276140,Distant Sun,game,False,"17 Jan, 2024",RPG,A sci-fi game based on character dialogue and choices. Uncover the mysteries of Pioneer Station by attempting diplomacy and seeking peace or gunning through those that stand against you. The decisions you make will have an impact on the ending.,"The trailer intrigued me making me wanting to try this game out. I wanted to give this game a fair chance, but right now this is a buggy mess with gamebreaking bug.
I am one hour in, at the VI department. stuck with a bunch of android robots and the game wouldnt let me continue. There's nothing else I can do, looked everywhere for at least 15 mins. Simply stuck with no further instruction.

Given this is an indie game, I can overlook the somewhat amateurish voice acting (I have a feeling this game is either made by an African or Chinese company ), I can overlook the bad coding ( 30fps on a RTX 3090 Kingpin, with DOOM 3 era graphics ). But I cannot overlook at gamebreaking bug unable to allow me to progress further into the game.

Some more bugs I've encountered : 

1. Picking up ammo while you don't have a gun equipped makes the ammo you'e picked up disappear. 
2. Saving the game after killing the robots, if you load the save, all the robots are back and you have the kill them again.

And here are some quality of life issues I have with the game:

1. The computer screen in game is way to messy to read the emails. Each computer screen has very complicated desktop background, and the color blends with the email font in white, making it VERY hard to read.

2. the teammate AI is kind of horrible, they are not smart enough to shoot enemies that are around them.

3. Teammates will keep blocking you near doorways and tight corridors.

==============

So, too bad, I bought this knowing it's indie and had expected some level of roughness. I was willing to find out how I am going to evacuate the survivors, I was even hoping to play this game multiple times to see what different branching options there are, but given the state of gamebreaking bug in this game right now, I'm going to have to refund this game.

Not recommended in the current state. The devs need to quality control this game way more before releasing it.

If dev ends up fixing the gamebreaking bugs, I may buy the game again. So here's hoping. A nice concept but it currently suffers from some major flaws:
-The optimisation is very bad. Very very bad. Major pop-in It suffers from the classic Unreal lighting problem. Some sizing down of the map could help, the assets are clearly very intensive. Also, for some reason, the visual options dont get saved between loadscreens?
-The voice acting strongly needs a second pass
-For some reason, the gun models are very bad. Far be it for me to say 3D modelling is easy but, like, Millenia was able to make much more convincing game models for fallout new vegas of all games. Also, the hands don't hold on to one very well. Especially bad with the glock. The game had me early on when conversing with our crew mates. This presented dialogue options. Even tho the voices are most likely AI, i appreciate that some form of voice over work is there. They sound natural enough. better than text to speech.  The issues arise after a distress call. I couldnt manage to pick up any weapons beside a glock. I also couldnt interact with a door's ""unlock/lock"" menu. It wouldnt work. Couldn't get past the early part. That's a bti sad as I was lookin forward to seein' how the combat section would play out. Still gonna check it again for updates.

1264970,The Conquest of Go,game,False,"7 Dec, 2020","Indie, Strategy, Early Access","Learn and play Go, the classic board game that has been played for thousands of years, and compete in the race to conquer the most land in the in-game world, or compete online against opponents around the real world.","Not necessarily worth the price, you can get almost everything this game has by just playing on ogs for free but it's a nice platform to play the game on Steam and not too costly so support the developer if you can. I'm new to Go and have been looking for a game that makes learning the ropes fun. I own both Just Go and Conquest of Go, and while I enjoy both, if I had to choose, Conquest of Go is the clear winner. The developer has been actively improving the game, adding cool new features, and encouraging community engagement, while Just Go seems to have been abandoned with no further updates.

The game itself is a fresh and exciting take on Go. The Steam Workshop integration is a fantastic way to add and share new puzzles, custom boards, and more, keeping the experience fresh. The soundtrack is relaxing yet motivating, every time I load up the game, I feel like a medieval king conquering enemy lands! The OSG integration and review mode are amazing! 

Feature Requests:
- The ability to play Tsumego/puzzles in a random order.
- A story mode of some sort. Who are we? A young king looking to grow their kingdom, or maybe a young general looking to prove themselves. 
- A career/tournament progression mode where you climb from a complete beginner 25kyu on a 9x9 board all the way up to a single digit player on a 19x19.
- A more in depth review mode. Right now it only covers 3 or so mistakes per game. 
- The ability to auto add your mistakes, from the review mode, into a custom Tsumego review list

If you're a fan of Go, this game is a 10/10, definitely worth playing! It's a very approachable, lightweight and customizable gamification of my favorite classic board game. 

The campaign mode itself is fun, with widely scalable difficulty (there's multiple different AI engines to choose from, each with difficulty sliders, along with all the clock and handicap options). You capture territory on the campaign map, earn resources, and can then spend said resources to buy meta moves such as a score estimate or an undo. You can also use the resources to purchase legendary game records from famous IRL players to view, if interested. There's some tsumego to do in-between the games, which is a fun change of pace. 

I also really enjoy the fact that you can pit two AI's against each other to follow along how they play, and you can import your own SGF-files to view within the game. 

Pretty much everything I could ask for with regards to keeping my old hobby easily approachable. Thank you developer :) Review in March 2025...

This is a delightful piece of software.  Highly recommended!

To be clear, almost all of its individual components can be found free online:
 - A pleasant introduction to Go/Baduk
 - Playing Go/Baduk against AI in stand-alone software
 - Playing Go/Baduk against people or AI on the OGS server
 - ""Life and Death"" Puzzles
 - A library of famous games to review and learn from
 - A library of opening moves and variations/joseki
 - Using AI to review your games to focus on 1-3 key moves you made needing analysis and improvement
 - Using AI as you play to see recommended options, estimate score, etc.
 - A ""sandbox"" mode to use when you have a book of tsumego problems and laptop but no physical set with you

The only component that to my knowledge is [b]not[/b] freely available elsewhere is an interesting ""partner mode"" for beginners where you and AI take turns making moves, sharing control of one player.

Anyway, with so much available elsewhere what you are actually paying for with [i]Conquest of Go[/i] is the overall experience.  It is [b]BEAUTIFUL[/b] visually and with its music.  It is [b]CONVENIENT[/b] to have all those resource listed above in one place.  And it has [b]PEDAGOGICAL BALANCE[/b] with a ""campaign mode"" that does not require us (but highly encourages us) to devote time to playing, analysis, and puzzles in similar proportions to well-established learning programs (such as GoMagic.org).

If you enjoy Go/Baduk and will be playing on a laptop/desktop the cost-per-hour for this software will become insignificant.

[b]Tangential note:[/b] If you are a brand new beginner, I also recommend the free classes on GoMagic.org up through ""The Fundamentals of Go on 13√ó13 ‚Äî Remake"" because that video/quiz curriculum is well-designed and compliments what this software teaches, to help beginners avoid making common mistakes so they have more fun. I haven't played the campaign as I don't play with AI, however the feature set for online gameplay is really good and I can only recommend this for Go fans. If you like go, you'll like this. If you don't like go, this game will probably not change your mind, which is fine. Remind ""EATTING"" to your opponent [b]TLDR[/b]
If you want to learn Go this is an absolutely amazing software to help you out and ease you in.
Its campaign and tools are all tailored towards teaching and improving your Go play - while also looking and sounding great.
Easy analysis, lots of nicely tuned AI options, SGF support for matches and Puzzles; the list goes on.

[b]Campaign[/b]
The campaign is a great starting point. 
Earning resources via wins and trading allows you to ""buy"" special skills like ""undo"", ""territory"", ""move variants"", and ""suggested move"" mid combat. 
Those skills are absolutely amazing when starting out. Basing them on resources ensures that one doesn't overuse them.

After finishing a match the game will run an automatic analysis pointing out the 3 biggest blunders in a little ""mini-game"" including move variations.
In the end the game will suggest adjustments to the AI and handicap that one can accept or deny.

Once you conquered a piece of land, you can can reinforce and protect it against invasions by doing Puzzles.
Also available after a win is the option to purchase professional tournament game records for resources. 

From time to time you can even see an invasion of your or AI territory and join in on the action.

If you don't want to play against AI, you can also fight actual humans via OGS (online-go.com).
Another option is to exchange resources for AI help, which turns this effectively into Pair Go with you and the AI taking turns.

[b]Story[/b]
A recent addition. Allows to add your own campaigns with characters, dialogue, and battle content (such as invasions, puzzles, and more).

[b]Quick Play[/b]
Three options are available here:
- Play against AI
- Practice Board (freely placing stones)
- Game Review
Available board sizes range from 5x5 to 19x19.

[b]Online Play[/b]
This allows you to play games on OGS (online-go.com) using CoG's interface and background music.

[b]Learning Center[/b]
Contains a tutorial for Go, a visual glossary, and an opening guide (allowing exploration of typical openings).
The big feature here is the steam workshop integration and its available Puzzles and game records.
This can also be used to upload your own Puzzles collections for example.
In general, the steam workshop integration is absolutely amazingly done and adding content is very simple.
 This review is from a Go newbie; never played before purchasing this game.   So if you are an experienced player, skip this review.

Basic features,
[list]
[*]Play by Japanese, Chinese, or Korean rules.
[*]Set a handicap value (playing against the [i]Casual AI[/i] doesn't allow a handicap of 1).
[*]Set a Komi value (scoring advantage for white, since black plays first).  Can be set in 1/2 point increments, for those of us who hate ties.
[*]Different board layouts.
[*]Numerous board sizes including 9x9, 13x13, & 19x19.
[*]Match review: Game will show your 3 worst moves, and suggest what you should have done.
[/list]
It's actually 4 games:
[olist]
[*]Match play against 1 of 4 computer opponents.   The 'easiest' is allegedly [i]Casual AI[/i], which gives a hard time with a zero handicap.
[*]Play against human, online.  Haven't tried this yet.
[*]Puzzles in the Steam workshop.  Found a good set of 10,000 of these.  And there are probably other sets.
[*]Campaign mode.  4x game, where the player wins military battles, by winning Go matches.
[/olist]
Though the review feature is helpful, it doesn't explain WHY the suggested move is better than the one that you played.  That feature becomes useful, as you understand the game.

[b]Campaign mode[/b]: Went through the tutorial, and decided it's not for me.  (Funny thing, this feature was a big selling point, at the time of purchase.)  Graphics are an eye sore; I'm a graphics snob.  And if I want 4x, I have [i]GalCiv4[/i] & [i]Warhammer: Gladius[/i], which do a great job at scratching that gaming itch.  Also, the AI opponent is progressive:  When the player wins a match, the difficulty increases for the next match, unlike normal match play.

[b]So what should a Go novice buy this game?[/b]:
[list]
[*]Excellent control over starting parameters.  Easy to fine tune a difficulty level, suitable to your skill.
[*]Very clean UI.  Hadn't touched this game in over 2 years, and had no trouble resuming play.
[*]Review feature.  Learn from the mistakes that you made in a match.
[*]Puzzles: Great way to improve is play matches against the AI AND solve puzzles.
[*]Supportive developer: Even after having purchased the game almost 3 years, he still answers questions on the forum.
[*]AI is not progressive.  Want to play against a tougher AI opponent?  YOU increase difficulty, vs. having the game do it automatically.
[*]Some of the board layouts are very crisp & high contrast.  Didn't realize how good the contrast was until I bought a real Go set.
[/list] The campaign mode is my favorite. Fun mix of 9, 13, and 19x19 board sizes, along with ""fortifying"" your land with life+death puzzles.

The music is relaxed. Not something I would have normally listened to but it goes well with the game.",0.14344835947294973

 Inexpensive game, 40 achievements, and 10 women in various states of undress: a recommendation from me Beautiful and relaxing game Another puzzle arranging game. The game has some well designed images locked behind some simple picture arranging. While it doesn't take very long, there are a lot of different women with 10 pictures each, Various amounts of pictures with good aesthetics. fun game with nice art work i enjoy it fun and simple wait for a sale for it only got this for the beautiful artwork style, don't really care for the game-play or the nudity.

If you want like me to get the beautiful looking fully clothed images as wallpapers get the art-book and copy paste the images from the game folder to your computer <3 Memory game. Four sets of ten pictures featuring girls portrayed in contrast (black and white, with a few areas of bright color). Each successive set goes from fully dressed to naked. Decent enough. This game has a very nice unique art style.  The artwork is in black and white but with certain parts of the pictures in color (which makes the color stand out).  It has nice fan service, relaxing music, chill matching puzzles to complete & 40 easy achievements to get.  But in truth we know why you are looking at this game....for the fan service ^_^.",0.1816716269841269

I'm really surprised at how well some of these Easter Eggs were hidden. This is a fun game for any age, with cleverly hidden Easter Eggs in nine different eras and three difficulty modes.
¬†
[b]DIFFICULTY MODES[/b]
Easy: Find multiples of each Egg pictured on the left.
Normal: The same as Easy Mode but a tad trickier to spot.
Hard: Find 20 Eggs shown one at a time.

You will earn most of the % based Achievements (find 10%-25%-50%-75%) just by completing all 3 Difficulty Modes. Some Achievements can be earned by playing the game in any mode.¬†¬†
The final Achievements can only be accomplished by replaying the levels several times. I found it easier just to keep replaying the same scene, on easy until you see the popup achievement from Steam and then move on to the next scene. Depending on your luck of the draw, you'll probably have to replay each scene an average of five times.

You can click the Easter Egg Icon box on the right side to get a hint. (There are no Achievements for not using a hint, so use it!) A black arrow will show you the direction to look for until you reach the random egg, which will have black arrows circled around it.

2992190,Blue Hunter,game,False,"18 Feb, 2025","Casual, Indie, RPG, Strategy","Welcome to hell! Blue Hunter is an RPG roguelike deckbuilder where you forge your own path as a hunter and turn into a god! Create your own army of undead monsters, unlock powerful skills and beat all the gods that stand in your way. How far can you go?","A very simplified and out-dated feeling Card battler, but something about that is also aesthetically pleasing. I don't think I will come back to it very much given on all the other amazing rogue-like card games out there, but I will be picking it up again when I just want something simple and relaxing. 100% would recommend this game. For me it gave me the fun of those webtoons and stuff like Solo Leveling while holding fun mechanics of a deck game. Reminds me of Slay the Spire fused with that concept. So, I bought this game based on the fact that the dev seemed very engaged in updating it and the game had a lot of potential.  The dev has since dropped this game completely and now the features you'd expect in a rogue deck builder simply don't exist.  You play as one of two classes and the only way to really change anything between play through is to increase the difficulty.  There's nothing to invest into to make yourself stronger or more versatile, there's very limited enemies, and with only 2 play styles available its a lack luster game at best and not worth really investing into since there will be no future updates. Really clever roguelike that gets straight into the gameplay without any fluff.  I like the rpg stat mechanics to build your character in various directions.  Good monster and card variety, seems like a lot of build diversity is present.  Will definitely be returning to this at some point. Fun game and worth the price tag. Not quite finished, but still feels very clean and well made, especially for a solo dev. The monster-to-card mechanic is neat. Since most cards can improve by obtaining another copy, it means fighting repeat monsters holds significant value. Also, each card is unique to each class, making each class truly a unique play style, even with the same deck and similar stats. Would love to see a progression system that carries over between runs and also a greater variety of classes. (Or maybe just a cheat mode so I can satisfy my need to max each stat in a single run?)  I'm very much looking forward to any updates for this game. Fun game and love Monster collecting and leveling mechanics.

The art and interface feels nostalgic. feels like collecting yugioh cards as a kid again. The premise of defeating monsters and using them as cards is very interesting! There is also a lot of potential for customization. Once there is more meta-progression the game will turn out to be great, even it's good already! This game has the outline to be one of the best games in the roguelike deckbuilder genre. The gameplay has just enough RNG to make every run feel very different and just enough consistency with upgrading your stats to increase damage, dodge etc. to make many builds feel super viable. The problem that I have with it is a serious lack of meta progression but the developer clearly has intentions of implementing it and updates the game on a weekly basis. If you want a really fun roguelike game that has the potential to be a masterclass in the genre, pick this up. What drew me to this game was the premise of the defeated monsters becoming the cards in your deck. It's a novel premise for a deck builder, and it works very well.
There are different strategies depending on which monsters you face, and therefore which cards you optionally add to your deck.  

Even better, your character has stats, which can be increased to add more hit points, more damage, extra mana, and more to make battles easier. 

Further customization is possible using skills, acquired from treasure rooms, the in game shop, or leveling your stats. 

Yet another aspect is the multiple classes to choose from when starting a run. While the skills and stats function the same for each class, the monsters as cards have entirely different functions for each class. 

Then if that's not enough, each class has 10 difficulty levels, each making the game more challenging. 

Being early access, there are sometimes a few bugs. However, the developer is very responsive on discord, and with weekly updates the bugs are usually fixed quickly. 

It's a fun game now, and keeps getting more interesting with each update. I'd recommend this game without hesitation to any fan of the roguelike deckbuilding genre. quite fun. you should try it",0.11717834249084244
2888470,Castle Doombad Classic,game,False,"12 Dec, 2024",Strategy,"BE THE VILLAIN and slay any hero who dares enter your dark domain! Deck out your castle with traps and minions as the ultimate diabolical dungeon keeper in this strategy / TD puzzler. Includes the original Castle Doombad game, rebuilt and remastered, plus brand new content.","Great TD game. I knew it from the mobile version and always wished for a Steam release good game play on phone while back This is by far a pretty good game. I'm looking forward to the future of this game and what is has to offer in terms of updates. an old classic game that I discover in a Tesla Car (Best Cars by far.. have not driven almost nothing in 3 months)
.. the game is a cool.. even when car, old and this incarnations are no exactly the same.   This is my childhood right here. I remember the good ol' days where  I downloaded this on my old LG G Flex and played that for hours and hours. Playing Endless Night Mode which isn't added in this version yet of course. That it would break a bit but I didn't care too much about the glitches then and now tbh. Well they are annoying to be frank, the sheer factor of it just being so fun that it blows those small issues out of the water. Making up for it most definitely. I highly recommend paying for this game here for this price as you have plenty of hours to enjoy and can come back to it with the new Rogue mode that randomizes things. Support these amazing developers so we can get more content added and the sequel released! When this game was removed from the iOS App Store, it was truly regrettable. Many people love this game, and with the new content with the Steam port, I believe that those who loved this game previously will be appreciative of the new content to sink their teeth into. A true mobile classic ported to Steam. 

In summary, I recommend this game because of the way it forces strategy and quick thinking to collide with its quick, strategic gameplay. The new mode ""Roguevenge"" appears nearly endlessly replayable, providing new challenge to both those who are new to the game and those who have played it before. If you have a tendency to like both roguelikes, tower-defense games, or puzzlers, I would strongly recommend picking up this game. just got all achievements, had fun Great game, and a fun take on TD games, with an inverted Twist. I loved the game when it was on mobile and got fairly high on the leaderboards. So it's great to get back at it with the new Roguevengeance mode, and to see all the new tools and traps. Just 100%ed it and Llooking forward to the next updates. Recommend you give the game a shot if you're a fan of tower defense games! hi i play this game for 8 years now, and im thriled to see this in pc! And this was my all time favourite phone game

And, i just wanna give some suggestions.(my english aren't so good, sorry about that)

my suggestion is mainly about pc transplantation. the main point is, could you make the game more convenient on pc?
here's some of my thoughts:
1. please all mouse wheel to move up and down, it would make the game waaaaay better.

After two hours of playing a bunch of 2v2 with a friend and some 5v5 with randoms THAT ALL USED COMS (not so comon in other games) I'm amazed of good this game is, can't wait for it to keep growing.
I got a more strategic feeling compared to how Rainbow SIx Siege is being played lately.  Hope I can keep having the same experience in the future. I really like the concept of this game. But the community is very small. good game

It'd be nice if the woman didn't walk so far away that you have to loop around multiple times to find her again, but other than that it's a good game. Hope to see more ore types added. This game was fun....I enjoyed grinding to get all the ores and coins and those earth things, not sure what else to call them. I escaped in just over 8 hours. But I was seeing how fast I could escape. This game has hours upon hours of play ability. So, this feels more like a tech demo for a complex forging system than it does a full game.

That said, this is a very fun and in depth forging system that ends up giving each sword you make a unique feel.

For what's here, I'd say this game is worth the price, doubly so if it's on sale. And I'm certainly interested to see what sort of games the developer can make in the future with this forging system. i cant figure out how to make different types of swords and the door is impossible to break even with an s tier diamond rapier I was honestly very excited to play the game but than, i got the ""DirectX 12 is not supported on your system. Try running without the -dx12 or -d3d12 command line argument."" message and ive done so much to try and fix it but i cant get it to work i do the dsdiag and my game supports directx 12, tryed the dx12 tried the d3d12 even dx11. im not bummed about the money to buy it, im more bummed out not to play the d*mn game Fun little game.

Final score: 8 This game is not worth $8.50 but suit yourself! While I appreciate the message this game is trying to portray, to treat all living beings especially animals with kindness, I do not agree with the agenda. Consuming meat does not make you a bad person, and just because someone chooses to be vegan, does not make them a good person. I do not agree with animal cruelty.  Just because someone decides to consume meat, does not make them an abusive and horrible human being. I did like the message similar to the man looking in the mirror with the camera option. We can choose to be better people, but choosing not to eat meat doesn't make you a better person. Overall I'd give this game a 5/5 for the graphics, 0/5 for the vegan agenda. It is hard to make a recommendation of this game. I mean it's a short fetch questing walking sim with no added bloat, but the underlying message seems vague. For a game that somewhat censures animal cruelty, you are given an option to actually inflict animal cruelty with no punishment whatsoever lol. Not to mention the game's visuals, main character (why is he walking like that?) and NPC sprites are looking adorable (despite some of them being morbidly misconfigured). I think the juxtaposing is cute, funny even, and made the tone of the endings creepier. I guess I'll give it a thumbs up. It's short and interesting, the Dev is trying to make some pretty big statements in a pretty small game. Straight to some of the points. I think that it was worth buying and playing. It's maybe an hour of your time depending on your pace and the Dev is generous with replay options once you finish.

The various endings gave a variety of closure and each creature's personality was tailored to their theme.

I may have only caught part of the Dev's message. If there was more, or if it were more balanced than I understood, then they might think about how they convey that in future games. 

A few issues for them to spiffy up:
1. Autosave isn't super great. I got to different points of progress and sometimes it saved up until that and other times it didn't. -- however, it is such a short game that this isn't too much of an issue. -- One way that the Dev is forgiving is that, for some things that you might have to run back for if you forgot, instead of having to go back (for those specific things) there's a dialog that lets you stay and ""bring the thing to you"". I thought that this was a really nice touch.

2. A crucial item for progression didn't end up in my inventory and I spent half an hour trying everything before realizing that it was a glitch and I would have to reset the game, which leads to issue 3:

3. It is VERY UNCLEAR how to start a new game. You can't even uninstall and reinstall, because it reloads your progress, even if you delete the local files manually. TO RESET THE GAME:

3a. Go into the game settings

3b. Click on the bug icon in the top right corner

3c. Now you can click on resetting the game.

I think that this last part should be a top menu item. Most other games have ""New Game"" or ""Reset"" along with the continue button in the main menu. The fact that I had to search for it was frustrating. At least it existed.

All in All, this is an entertaining and thoughtful game and absolutely worth your time! Firstly, I just want to warn everyone that this game has a sad story and some of the images may be traumatizing. 

The game is really beautiful and the story makes a lot of sense. You will see circumstances through the eyes of a human as well as the animals and you need to make friends wherever you go. 

I personally would not buy this game at the price it is listed for, however I do recommend getting the game on a special. This game is so bad it's good. I get the message it was trying to get across, but if it wasn't that condescending maybe more would've taken this seriously.

Buy this when it's on sale the controls are pretty wonky. I bought this game because it was really cheap and it seemed weird.  I've only done one playthrough, which took about an hour, and I was not disappointed.  I'm definitely going to play it a few more times and see how making different choices might affect the story.

If you're a fan of strange or dark games this will probably be right up your alley. Gives you something to think about",0.011533032185206099

Has a total of [b]5[/b] trading cards. This mini game is satisfactory; however, there are several aspects that require improvement. The title of the game indicates that it serves as a brief diversion, typically lasting between five to ten minutes, after which it tends to become somewhat monotonous. It is important to acknowledge that this is an indie game. Nonetheless, it provides an enjoyable way to pass the time.

The graphics are straightforward, the controls are user-friendly, and it offers a significant amount of amusement along with a touch of competitiveness. The gameplay fundamentally depends on one's reaction speed, strategic thinking, and timing. As a more seasoned gamer, I find that my reaction speed has diminished since my younger days, which limited my progress. However, I genuinely enjoyed the experience, especially while playing with my children, who took turns sitting on my lap.

[b]Personal Comment[/b] $1 Ride is a fun and affordable game that‚Äôs easy to pick up and play. The high score challenge and easy controls make it enjoyable for quick gaming sessions.

However, the limited content and basic graphics can make it feel repetitive after a while. Occasional bugs and the lack of multiplayer options are also notable drawbacks.

Overall, $1 Ride is a good choice for anyone looking for a cheap and cheerful game to pass the time. If you enjoy simple, high score-based games, it‚Äôs worth giving it a try.
 i loved this game so much and its cheap and recommend it I am 32 years old.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you. [h1]1$ Ride[/h1]

Hope you enjoyed my review, god bless you I love this game:
-Clean graphics and snappy animation
-Awesome ""feel"", every car is different
-The tracks wear-in with more rubber and grip along the racing line as laps go by
-Tire wear and fuel consumption change the cars dynamics, and both require planning for pit stops
-Good variety of AI competition for all skill levels

This is the best little indie game I've bought in a while, I've recommended it to all of my gaming friends. I've played a long list of automotive sims, and this somehow feels as good as many of them, but packaged in an exciting, fun, quick-pick-up-and-put-down game. Super well done, great work OFG!

877550,Digital Jigsaw Puzzle,game,False,"3 Aug, 2018","Casual, Indie",A jigsaw puzzle game with 150+ puzzles with sizes up to 576 pieces. You can even load your custom image as a puzzle!,"bought a bunch of different jigsaw puzzle games to see which would be best for my SO to use. she loves puzzles. this one is easy to use and has four custom slots for creating puzzles using any image the player has available. she's loves using it to make custom puzzles of her pet pics. i'm loving it for creating custom puzzles of memes from Discord channels

even if you don't like that feature, it does have a lot of built in content. much more then all the others ones i got. plus, as i said earlier, it is extremely easy to set up and use This game is quite relaxing and enjoyable, though the UI feels a little unpolished. A tip is to hit ESC to get the close menu since I don't see any other way to close out the game while playing. This is great if you like jigsaw puzzles; and I really, really enjoy them. The pics are hard enough to be challenging, but if they are too hard for you on any one of them, just use your mouse to make the puzzle smaller or larger, and choose more or less pieces to suit your taste.  Really fun! I enjoy this one! Pieces are clunky and dull. I bought this to make my own puzzles, on sale, barely worth it but not really. Pieces are stretched to fit screen but only cover 1/4 of the screen for the small puzzle (8x8). The are a variety of options but they seem to just try to make the puzzle more frustrating to complete, not more complex. If they boosted the quality and fixed the size issues it would be a $10 program. The only reason I am posting this review as a negative is in order to try and get the developer's attention on something. I actually really like this game, it's a ton of fun especially since you can add your own custom images as puzzles. The idea that I have is for multi monitor support. The play area feels very congested on one monitor. It would be AMAZING if we can have the pieces on one monitor and the play area on the other. I will definitely change my review, even if I just get a quick response from them :) I like the clack sounds Arguably the best value jigsaw puzzle game I've seen on Steam. Hours of entertainment using the provided puzzles, and the underappreciated feature to add your own images to generate new ones provides a virtually unlimited number of puzzles to try.  The only negative I observed is that the aspect ratio is slightly off for the puzzles and they always seemed slightly squished. Unfortunately at this time the achievements don't count on Steam's totals. Perfectly servicable puzzle game.  I can't say I've ever used any of the included images - so I can't comment on them, I have enough of my own images that I don't need to rely on theirs.  That one item alone recommends this puzzle game.
Things I would like to see:  
1)  Puzzles that don't rely on resizing the image to fit the puzzle dimensions.  I won't ding them too hard on this - I fully realize the difficulty of generating a puzzle from what could be essentially a random sized image.  This game didn't cost 300 bucks or something, so the author deserves credit for what was delivered - but it would be nice to see a wider range of image sizes accommodated.
2)  Sounds.  This is an easy fix to implement so I'll be less forgiving.  The sound of pieces when let go gets SOOO annoying.  The ability to either change the sound or turn it off completely would be a welcome addition Aspect ratio is off on majority of the puzzles. Puzzle images can only be square, 1:1 aspect. Most stock images appear squished. Does not have 150 puzzles as it claims. Only has 50.

Not worth the price, even as cheap as it is. This was a great purchase. It sounds simple, but no other puzzle game/software on steam makes custom puzzles so easy. Not everything about this product is smooth or user-intuitive, but it lets you import your own pictures and create puzzles out of them! To do so, you'll need to go directly to the game files and add copies of the pictures. If you love puzzles and want to do virtual puzzles with your own pictures, grab this when it's on sale. You won't be disappointed.",0.13372018052869114

Would work better as a straightforward puzzler... with better difficulty progression a well put together puzzle game that can be frustrating (in a good way) but very rewarding when you solve a puzzle Perfect Angle is a short but very nice game. You have to move around objects in order to find a shadow on the wall. Something like we did when we were young: make a butterfly with your hands. Or you have to turn around objects in order to find a new shape. Not really hard, most of the time. So it's an relaxing game. The story and the narrating gets bored after a while. As for me, it doesn't have any added value. But that's me. Perhaps it gives you more depth in the story. Rating: 8 out of 10. Very good game. Works perfect even on old hardware. Relaxing play and many things that you can think about. Excellent Game! Very thought provoking with a good story, alot of bad reviews cause it offers you to buy hints, But hints are given if your still having a problem after around 4 min. I think the developer just wanted people to try and solve the puzzles and if your lazy then buy some hints so you can zoom through the game if you want. But really you don't need to buy anything solving the puzzles is fun and this game is worth 2.50. Absolutely not the game I was waiting for. Boring and incoherent. About 25% of the puzzles are cool but the others...annoying. Didn't worth the EUR2 I've paying for it. If you can get it for free, take it but don't pay. Especially not for the ingame clues.... TL:DR at bottom above the *

I feel that a puzzle game should be challenging but intuitive.  Ultimately the player needs to understand more than the mechanic of the game/level.  They also should understand the goal of each level and game.  Now in no way do I think this means giving the player the answer*.  The player should be able to deduce what it is they are looking for.  The game is broken into these ""series"" and (I feel) these seires should have puzzles that flow together to form a ""theme"".... And they sort of almost acomplish this.  But I am still at a loss in each puzzle what I am looking for.

For example.  In one puzzle I end up making what appears to be a ""Chess Pawn"" and the next level I ended up with a comb.  Now it turns out that the ""Chess pawn"" was supposed to be hand soap on the guys Bathroom Sink.  But this idea and theme was not communicated till all the objects had been found. 

Ways to fix this.  The backgrounds instead of being used as advertisment space** should be used to help descibe the theme.  For the scenario above the backgrounds could have taken place in a large bathroom(s) with the broken pieces scattered in different bathroom looking backgrounds.  This makes me think What might I find in a bathroom and work from there. 

This allows the player to feel acomplished and know what they are looking for.  There were several puzzles (Especially the seahorse one) where I had no idea what I was looking for until the game said (unexptedly) I had the solution and showed me what I got.

TLDR: In short A player in a puzzle game should never be surprized that they got an answer.  This does not leed to a feeling of acomplishment but stupidity and shame. 

That being said Nice Graphics
Nice Controls

*(You can BUY ""hints"" to do tell you what you are looking for 'Cough microtransactions on a paid game Cough' but this isn't what my complaint is about)
** Oh Yea that too Very philisophical game which makes you see the beauty in the everyday, the light in that darkness, the clarity in the unknown. Follow someone through the different stages of his life as he tries to find the solutions to all his problems, only to find that they were around him the whole time. Amazing thought provoking game which can be slightly frustrating when you dont know what to look for, but dont worry, the game will give you hints.",0.04833111667449011

Shoot your way through retro-futuristic levels filled with enemies, iconic over the top bosses and never ending bullets. Insert coin to play! ü§ñ","Get rid of the annoying teleporter, or at least include a way to disable it, and  this becomes a thumbs up [h1]A TRON-like Bullet-Hell VR Shooter That Is Extremely Fun![/h1]

If you're a fan of stylish, high-octane bullet-hell arcade VR shooters, ARK & ADE is a must-play. The game impressed me right from the start with its TRON-like visual style, delivering a neon-drenched aesthetic that is both modern and nostalgic. The way you get sucked into the arcade cabinet from the basement, was just super cool to see in VR. The vibrant colors and simplistic graphics perfectly complement the fast-paced arcade gameplay and looks very pleasing in VR.

[b]Shooting Mechanics & Enemies[/b]

The arcade-style shooting mechanics are very satisfying in this game that give nods to various arcade games from the 80s and 90s. Weapons are given to you like Metal Slug, shoot the upgrade powerup in the air and you will receive the new weapon with limited ammo. Once the ammo is depleted, you get your main pistol blaster back. The difficulty is fair, striking a perfect balance between challenge and enjoyment. There are lots of enemies to shoot and enemy types have quite a lot of variance ranging from normal humanoid beings armed with laser pistols and shotguns to drones that shoot rockets at you. The game keeps you on your toes without feeling too overwhelming.

[b]Boss Fights[/b]

There are boss fights in ARK & ADE which are a highlight of the game, providing some of the most engaging and fun moments. Each boss encounter is uniquely designed for that particular level that give good variety to the gameplay and visuals. Boss fights are well designed and feel satisfying when you complete them.

[b]Gamemode Variety[/b]

The game offers a rich variety of content. With numerous levels to conquer, an endless mode that plays like Pistol Whip, and a survival mode where you battle waves of enemies in an arena, there's plenty to keep you engaged. Each mode adds its own unique twist, ensuring the gameplay remains fresh and exciting.

[b]bHaptics Integration[/b]

ARK & ADE has one of the best utilization of bHaptics I have encountered. Right from the moment when you select a level and you get sucked into the machine, the vibration of the vest and what is happening is VERY cool and gives a sensation that you are actually getting sucked into the machine. The vest vibrates as if your clothing is fluttering in the wind as you travel quickly forward into the machine. This alone is extremely cool and causes a bit of a thrill.

[b]Overall[/b]

Overall, ARK & ADE stands out as a top-tier arcade VR shooter. Its stylish visuals, fair difficulty, and diverse modes make it a game that keeps me coming back to. Highly recommended for anyone looking to immerse themselves in a visually striking and action-packed experience. Works on Reverb G2 with minor issue.

Retro arcade VR shooter with minimalistic visuals and frantic gameplay. It's quite short, but every second is filled with non-stop action.

Every shot is projectile based, both shooting and dodging feels satisfying. Strafing speed is slow enough to encourage real life side stepping to avoid damage from time to time. Enemies are surprisingly varied for such a small game, and there is a unique boss for every level, that will quickly turn the game into a bullet-hell. There is almost no down-time for action, feels like the game was initially designed as a on-rail shooter in the best way possible. 
The campaign can be beaten in less than an hour, but the game is good enough to stick around for replaying on higher difficulty and trying endless modes. Although, bosses become a bit too bullet-spongy on Highfor my taste.

Stylized minimalistic visuals look timeless in VR and perform well. And some effects(like bullet collisions and transition between main menu and levels) are quite beautiful.

Works on Reverb G2, but in-game hands are misaligned. Thankfully, it is barely noticeable when aiming with laser pointer Wow! By far the best arcade shooter in VR yet. I am a sucker for the style but really the levels, the musical score and the game play loop is really just so well designed. Each campaign level is an ode to a popular type of media of the time and the difficulty really emulates the challenge of games from the 80's. The game can get really physically demanding on harder modes, or you can play the game casually on normal. There is ton of replay value, trying to accomplish all the achievements (some which I swear may be darn near impossible) and the arena modes are the icing on the cake. There are leaderboards, a campaign, and the gameplay loop is just plane addictive. My only thought is that as far as I know, there is no pause button mid level, which may be a welcome addition for those that may need to pause mid level. Highly recommend. For the price you wont be disappointed. I am 5 hours through, only played the arena modes 4 times and just part way through the campaign on hard after beating the game on normal. Worth every penny! Fun game play, just a bit too short. The game only takes you about 2-3 hours to beat and the final boss was honestly the easiest boss in the game due to it being so easy to cheese. If you want the game to be longer, play on the hardest difficulty. The game could also use a better soundtrack, default music is fine but something like what is in Hotline Miami would fit the game very well. I also think some higher render distance would be nice on PC, but I understand this might not be possible on quest. If you enjoy Arcade style gameplay and a wide enemy variety, then this game is for you. If you come in here expecting a 20 hour campaign with a deep story line then you will be disappointed (But you probably already know that from the trailer). It's an alright game. Pretty sure I nabbed it on a sale but for the cheap price, it was worth! Just a fun game if you want something to shoot. LITERALLY AN ARCADE SHOOTER, BUT IN VR (this is a good thing) Do I like this Game .....No, I f****g LOVE it!
You tube review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG9aLX3NKAc

I've been waiting for Vr since ""The Lawnmower Man"" - and ive played a few games, but this, at just over ¬£7 is a masterpiece really. 
Its proper arcade shooter of the past In virtual reality. A lot of love had thought has gone into this, the bosses are great - the level design is great and the synth wave soundtrack is rocking! 
Replay value is high, why? Because it goes back to the roots of gaming. High score leaderboards! You have to get to the top of the world leaderboard - become the best. I'd like to see tournaments  in the future!  

 This game is terribly boring to myself, simply because it's just a game where you point and shoot, there's nothing to really move your body about in here, just standing still and pointing your pewpew gun at people. You can't sprint, no choice for manual reloading, you can't hold the gun with two hands for some added immersion fun either, since your off-hand is used for other abilities.

It's poorly optimized for such a pixelated game too. I'm not on a top-tier PC, but running on an i9-9900k with a 3060 Ti, NVMe SSD, and 32 GB of RAM isn't an issue for any other VR game I own. The kicker is then that they didn't add any graphics settings in the game, so you have no options for fixing it for yourself by downgrading a few things.

I'm not even gonna be able to fully review it, as I couldn't even make it past 6 minutes with the poor optimization and no fix for it. Returning it and will see if it ever improves later on for a potential repurchase. Hope anyone else has had fun, but if you have worse specs than me, then you're gonna struggle to play this game when it loads new chunks of the level. $3 for this one, tops.

Yeah... it was ok. I got this on sale for $9 and I don't think it was worth it. I don't really care/want to replay this. The replay mechanics don't really appeal to me.

The 'great soundtrack' tag got me, but I don't think that's the case. Repetitive enemies. Secrets that (for a first time player) may as well be totally random. Locked paths is annoying. Some cool weapons, some cool bosses, but I've played a lot of RPGs that have that, and also a compelling binding narrative and/or expansive beautiful environments. ArKAde has neither. It was just kind of a shooting gallery that you're supposed to be able to get through in about 5 minutes per level.

It's not that I disliked it, I just know my gaming time would've been better spent elsewhere.",0.10928282828282837

If you look at this more like an animated horror film with about a half hour running time, it's well worth the asking price. I'm not sure why the husband never runs for it though. The first few things that happen could be written off, but seriously, most people, including me would have booked it. 

The clown doll was unique and the story line could be read several different ways. But where and why does someone get creepy life-sized dolls? How would a realtor sell a home with those assets to anyone who has seen even one horror movie? Still it's a clear tribute to at least one horror film and not half bad for its age.

 [h1]Played On: [b]HTC Vive[/b][/h1]

The Night the Carsons Disappeared is a horror ""movie"" that lasts about half an hour. Without spoiling the experience and giving too much away, it explores the mysterious and still unexplained 2009 disappearance of Katie Carson's husband, Michael, and her two children in Richmond, Ontario Canada. All in all, it takes elements from horror classics such as The Amityville Horror, Paranormal Activity, and The Strangers.

Since you, the viewer, are playing as Michael Carson, you will be seated in the living room of the family home. Keep in mind that this is the non-interactive version of the game, and therefore you will just be observing your surroundings. Around you, strange and disturbing events slowly unfold in both audio and visual form. Depending on how easily you scare, there's a good chance that you may quit before the entire duration is up. Thankfully, there are no heart attack inducing jumpscares, but rather a combination of subtle and in-your-face moments of terror.

There are a few downsides to The Night the Carsons Disappeared, and most of them are pretty major immersion breakers. Many times throughout the experience the audio plays through the wrong speaker channel; for instance, a door opens to the right of you but the sound of it opening comes through the left speaker. There are also many situations where it seems to take minutes for the next event to start happening. Additionally, the graphics are really, really terrible even by low standards, [spoiler]especially where the character and dog models are concerned[/spoiler].

For a buck, The Night the Carsons Disappeared isn't awful by any means. It has a lot of potential and room to grow, and hopefully the developer can iron out some of the aformentioned issues prior to the release of the interactive version. The set up for the story is highly believable, and I actually searched to see if it was based off a true story. For what it is, and for the price, grab it if you enjoy some mild scares.

The VR Network [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33182845-The-VR-Network/]Curator[/url] | [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/thevrnetwork]Group[/url] Click for More Good story, good concept but the lack of quality animations for the ""main character"" and the dog ruined it for me. It turned out better than I thought that I have to sit around and wait for events to happen, was like a interactive ""movie"" but like I say the character work should have been much better. Not bad, not great.  It was kind of like those scare house rides some theme parks have, except you aren't in a moving tram thing.  Game was about 25 mins long which isn't terrible since I only paid like 2 dollars.  The scale was way off for me, and I was floating way above the chair (I started the game sitting down as suggested), but it was still enjoyable enough. This game could be a lot more than what it is.

Unfortunately it simply ended up as one of the most boring ""games"" where you can't do anything and nothing really happens. Also, those spaced out 'scary' parts are just not enough to keep anyone away from falling asleep.

The voices are great tho. very spoopy A real must for anyone who likes VR Horror!  Great experience for anyone new to VR as the experience is very comfortable (except for the horror parts ofcourse ;) )  Dev is very receptive and listens to feedback and ideas and acts on them which is very refreshing.

Plays way too many visual tricks on you at times. The larger shapes mechanic is something so obvious I'm surprised it took this long to get added to this style of puzzle game. I think my main issue is that they start out with a lot of novel and creative setups involving these larger shapes, but then kinda just... stop, once the other mechanics get reintroduced in later sections of the world. It does start to feel a bit stale by the end, and this is a fairly easy pack once you get the hang of the new mechanics, too, but it's a pretty fun one all the same. Fun new mechanic has been introduced! Absolutely love puzzly minesweeper-like games, and this one scratches just the right spot for my brain. This expansion introduces tiles that are shaped differently. The confusing part is that the number is displayed multiple times on those tiles.

Score: 4/10

Created with <3 Man, I want to love this game - but I hit a wall every time I play it. Not because the game is bad, but because of performance issues. It appears to do most work on a single CPU core and, as soon as you have a ""medium"" station, you start getting stuttering that makes the game unplayable. I came back to give it a go with my Ryzen 3600.. it didn't fair much better than my previous Intel 3770k. Performance issues were also seen on Steam Deck.

I love this sort of game, and I am just sad that with 70+ hours played, I have never been able to build a full station. Had a lot of fun playing this colony sim several years ago.  Very much enjoyed the amount of content and the different mechanics at play, though in some cases half the fun was figuring out how it all worked.

If you're into colony sims and don't mind a bit of combat and are capable of braving the unknowns of space, it's certainly a game worth playing (especially at a price point below $15!). The game isn't too bad, but it feels like you have to learn a lot through trial and error. There isn't much in the way of information either inside the game or on the web. I played for 10 hours and I've still barely escaped the initial systems, and mistakes slow things down even further.

As an example- every time you recruit someone the next recruit costs more. So if you have a bad mission, or invasion, and lose a bunch of a staff you are now in a position where replacing each experienced staff member costs increasingly more, and you're replacing fully geared experienced staff with inferior unequipped, untrained versions. This forces even more conservative play as you slowly crawl back up. Game is fun to play even though it feels like early access. I would recommend however to buy the original.
The balance and bugs make the game a bit of a struggle but it remains fun for the most part. What is not fun is the game breaking bugs like resources no longer collecting properly. Great game! no I have to personally say no, so far.",0.04569824383654171

1408070,Midnight Manor,game,False,"30 Sep, 2022","Action, Adventure, Indie","A short, spooky pick-em-up platformer.","It's a fun little game that I knew nothing about going in. It has a eerie/spooky vibe that I liked.

Maybe it's a bit too short? You can replay for multiple endings, but it's a little repetitive because it doesn't really branch a lot and the first part is really the same, I still haven't found one of them.

I just have a few minor criticisms:
- Controls can't be changed? The default keyboard controls are spread out with arrows+tab/q+w+e+space, I usually remap to wasd+hjkl(and/or surrounding keys) layout. I even looked and there's a save.json file, but nothing about keys, unless I'm missing it.
- The platforming has a lot of jump-through platforms that you drop down from with down+jump, and holding them doesn't seem to work so you gotta tap jump, and there doesn't seem to be any (or little if there is) forgiveness for early presses, which can be done by buffering the input.
- The music in one area loops often and it doesn't fade well, sound like it stops and starts over, I think it's the upper level.
 I do like this game. It's affordable and It is short but can be replayed. This is def a speed runner game (not a speed runner myself) so if you're someone who is an achievement collector, buy with caution. You may get frustrated or put hours of replay into it. There are no save points since the game is intended to be played in one sitting and there are no guides or walkthroughs to the under 8 minutes achievements, which is frustrating. I do think with practice it can be achieved. I am not sure if the timer starts again after the first stage even though the timer does continue it's count. It feels impossible to get the under 8 minutes achievement but again I am not a speed runner, this may be different for those who are. Small, but lovely game with some secrets

I enjoyed this game, this is the type where you can fing all endings (and a secret scene?) just doing exploring and trying some ideas. Controls are nice, 2d retro atmosphere, a lot of achievements.
Game is short, but it is making easier to find all endings. ENG:
This pretty good, has a bit of platforming and puzzle, but with very little difficulty, the pixel art looks nice and the music although somewhat repetitive gives good atmosphere, the negative point is that it does not have to save the game so you have to pass it in one attempt, and this for each final, so you have to pass it 4 times.

ESP:
Esta bastante bueno, tiene un poco de plataformeo y puzzle, pero con muy poca dificultad, el pixel art se ve lindo y la m√∫sica aunque algo repetitiva acompa√±a bien la ambientacion, el punto negativo es que no tiene para guardar la partida por lo que hay que pasarlo de un intento, y esto para cada , por lo que hay que pasarlo 4 veces. A nice little game with excellent pixel graphics and polished gameplay. For a price low as 2 EUR, I can only recommend it!",-0.02119949494949493
3547310,Smell like a puddle,game,False,"23 Apr, 2025","Adventure, Indie","‚Äî Each of us fell into a puddle. And everyone knows that you can find yourself after that... in a strange place from which there is no escape. Didn't it happen?.. Well, it's nothing ‚Äî it's going to happen soon! You will have to explore your new home... and become a part of it. ^-^","Whenever there is an indie game that gets very popular, it almost feels like it creates its own subgenre in a bubble, in this case we have these psychological visual novels, but more specifically games with a sense of existentialism, and maybe a touch of melancholy. Sometimes they can come across as cheap imitation or clones, sometimes they put enough of a spin on it to make something different. I still have not played the progenitor game so I don't know how they compare, I just thought this game was okay for $2, at least compared to other similar games.

It's only about 30-minutes, seems to have 2 endings, one of them being abrupt, if there is another one I am not sure, I got 3/3 achievements so I assume I am done. There are a few small things that can be missed if you don't take the opportunity to click on everything, but beyond that it does not seem like the dialogue choices were that important (outside of that one abrupt ending)

The story has a relatively common theme, you find yourself in a place from which you can't get out, a world in the puddle, or I suppose a mental block, something these games tend to explore a lot. I don't think it's a particularly creative idea, too many games do it, but overall I think the writing wasn't too bad, somewhat playful and a little though-provoking, especially if it's translated from Russian which does not always work that well. On a personal level I wish you added a few other elements to the story beyond its metaphor for a mental state, because like I said, I think too many games go for it, and I wish you had something else going for it.

The art panels were not too bad actually, considering the game is only $2, there was some effort to create a few unique effects and scenes, I actually didn't even think it would go that far after playing a certain Bread game. It still feels like you are going for a similar presentation, but overall not too bad, I think the pacing and the narrative of the game works well enough.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

(+) For $2 I thought the art panels were decent, I like that you trying to add some weird effects and interactions (not all games do it), and the writing actually wasn't too bad, similar to other games for sure, but it still works for what it is

[h1]Feedback:[/h1]

- Did you intentionally not translate the last part of the game, it's Russian in English and English in Russian

- I was playing with the headphones and I actually found the analog text effects and music a bit painful, I was able to just lower it and work around that way, but just something to keep in mind, that ambient tone you going for isn't bad, just be mindful of it being potentially hard on the ears 

- It's okay to take inspiration from the games you like, but I personally would advice you to separate yourself even further, the games don't seem that similar on a surface, but I personally wish you had a few more angles to the story, something outside of the metaphor for being in a hole

[b]Overall Thoughts: 6/10[/b]

Obviously there is a touch of imitation somewhere there, many games do it, but I still see some nice things, the writing is interesting but I would recommend detaching yourself further from those Milk adjacent games, do something that is fully yours, and that thing you do with interactions and mini games, keep that going, most games won't do it. Also I think adding a few more characters probably would help a lot, I think that interaction with the person at the end was probably the better part of the game.

500190,Firefight,game,False,"11 Jul, 2016",Strategy,"Firefight is a World War II real-time simulation game similar in style to the old Close Combat series but brought up to date with better AI, individual soldier modelling, a faster frame rate to give more intense and realistic combat and an easy to use command interface.","Great game here. Hard but very fun and has some surprising layers to it. this game is great the dev is still adding and fixing stuff I grew up loving Close Combat, this is better! Much revamped version of the old Sean O'Connor game very much in the vein of the classic ""Close Combat"" series, but without the same campaign structure and instead offering a series of individual battles and custom battles. Easy breezy controls but with a bunch of mechanical depth and some neat (for a top down, 2D game) ballistic physics. 

There's admittedly some things I miss from the original Firefight, like the generated, linked campaigns, but I understand that it's probably not something that can be so easily done with this engine and higher fidelity maps. Plus the original is still out there, if you know where to look. Coming from Close Combat, I had some difficulty getting used to the different camera system. But now I've put more hours in this game I definitely think this has the potential to be the better game.

I really like the blue indicator to move your infantry troops, it works so well to quickly spread them out. When you zoom in you can really notice how they look for good cover positions.

My favorite moments are when an enemy team is holed up in a house. I pin them with 1 unit and storm the house on their flank with another infantry unit. It all works so well and the firefights are pretty damn cool. Unlike CC, your units can move pretty fast in hurry mode, I really like that.
Often you see a few enemy soldiers panicking and retreating and they get shot as they run away. The AI can be impressive at times.

Definitely worth it for it's price. worth every cent, perfect game and developer is always adding something new very good Very fun and easy to learn but also difficult and requires strategy to do well. Huge amount of content with 27 maps and 8 scenarios for each. Lots of vehicles and different units. This is a great game in principle and ha some really nice attention to detail, but the pathfinding and unit logic leaves a LOT to be desired. This makes matches significantly more difficult because your units die needlessly. For a game of this price, especially one that has been around this long, I really expected it to be more polished and honestly think I'll be refunding unfortunately. 

- Units default to 'careful' movement logic. Commanding a unit to move somewhere doesn't result in them moving there if there's even the slightest amount of action near to them. The only way to make them move is with the 'hurry' command. However if they take too long to move away from the action, the 'hurry' action times-out and they're again stuck there. If I tell a unit to move somewhere, I expect them to do so. This is a game where you are commanding the units but they seem to ignore your commands the vast majority of the time which is incredibly infuriating. 

- Enemy units should at very least ALL be highlighted once engaged. Instead they go invisible and show up and disappear again completely randomly making it very hard to strategise what to do when you have no idea the enemy force size or where they are. Ideally you'd be able to see where the enemy are at all times because currently the first round requires you to send a bunch of infantry out to be ambushed so figure out where the starting locations of enemy are - otherwise your tanks will all be destroyed by the hidden tanks and AT teams - then you restart the match and play normally.

- Mortar teams fire absurdly slow and take multiple rounds to get even remotely close to the designated target. By the time they start getting accurate (5+ minutes of firing at a rate of around 1 round a minute) the targets have moved already. Yet the enemy mortar teams are able to fire off 5 rounds at one time with amazing accuracy. Of course they're invisible though so you'll end up half your infantry destroyed before you can deal with them since they start mortaring you from across the entire map and your own infantry keep ignoring your move commands or moving only when it pleases them, at a snail's pace. 

- Same deal with artillery, takes an age for it to get accurate and the strike itself is not very accurate. 

- Tanks constantly favour targeting infantry even when there is a much bigger threat of another tank right in front of them. This results in you losing a lot of a tanks completely unnecessarily. For some reason they always travel with the turret facing the complete random direction to where the action is as well...why?

- If you slightly adjust your tank's position, it might move, it might not, or it might do a 20-point turn, reverse and drive all over the place to readjust, depends on how random it wants to be. 

- You have zero idea of a unit's effective range. If you command an 'open fire' order at a particular target, you have no idea if the LOS is blocked, or it's out of range etc. Yet enemy infantry manage to snipe you from all the way across the map when your own infantry can't seem to see anything unless it 10 metres in front of them.

- This game has no built-in guide or tutorial other than a brief overview of the controls. When an infantryman gets injured, can he be treated? Is he out of action? Why do tank crews bail out but are then completely uncontrollable? What does the house icon mean on some infantrymen? The tanks constantly fire at enemy infantry in buildings - can they actually cause damage or are they just wasting ammo? Sometime you get reinforcements in the middle of the game, is that because the crews made it back or because they were scheduled? No idea...and the game doesn't tell you....

Ironic considering she wears bladed fighting gauntlets. (Which deceives you into the wrongful assumption she is more of a boxer-type instead. Then you notice the additional blades protruding from her boots. By then it is probably too late!) 

Overall

+Cute and ""hawt"".
+Humble nurturing personality.
+Apologetic and kindhearted.
+ Comes with a really sexy ""beast girl outfit"" and a few other alternate fashion choices so if you are happy with that there's no need to buy the more expensive expanded wardrobe bundle.
+ Holds up well with the rest of the roster. (Is not over-powered nor under-powered.)

Got her during a lunar sale for $3.20 with tax. She's a worthwhile addition but obviously being the OG I am I would have preferred it if she was an in-game unlockable. There's historical context connected to her origins and she made her debut in Samurai Warriors 4.

Oh,and Tecmo Koei? I wish we could make female characters look this beautiful in games like Nioh 2. Have the more realistic character customization for those whom want it but also throw in just a few in-game ""sexy"" options as well. You know and I know a Nioh 3 with expanded ""hawt husbando/hawt waifu"" avatar choices would sell like hot-cakes. Look into the pre-orders of Stellar Blade if you need further confirmation!

It is built around a strong central mechanic and utilizes its limited toolset to its full advantage. Very strong recommendation. This game is charming, fun, casual, and just the right amount of challenge.

There's your gun, and your torch. You can throw your torch and use it to light torches. You can upgrade both and use as multi-purpose items as the game progresses. You go through a mini-platforming game where you solve mild puzzles using your tools.

It's balanced, it's broken up into mini-areas with checkpoints which makes it great for short sessions if you prefer. The mechanics gradually expand as you go, and it's paced well. The sounds, graphics and animations are well-done and cool and appropriate. New monster types and hazards appear as you proceed.

It is a small game, limited in scope. But it also knows it's limits, is crafted with a delicate touch, and nothing overstays it's welcome. It was a refreshing experience. Check out the free game this dev made - it is lovely as well.

This one is worth asking price. Personally I want this dev to have my money. Seems to have received a lot of updates since release, but as of June 12, 2024, Lulu's Temple has received its final update! This makes it a quick and fun ride, lasting about an hour of high-tension exploration and platforming. Using both a gun (that you can charge for a burst of bullets) and a torch (that you can charge to throw at your enemies or to light distant wall-mounted torches) is more fun that you might expect, since you have to juggle between the two to illuminate your surroundings, kill enemies and toggle traps from afar. Having only one life point is a bit rough, but checkpoints are frequent enough that it's never too much of a problem - except for those ninja mummies which can and will get you every single time!

Absolutely recommend getting it, Agelvik does some great short games and deserves more support. It's frequently on sale too :) my game I grew quite fond of the little games of ""Agelvik"", and ""Lulu's Temple"" is a solid and somewhat visceral package of a fairly challenging pixel-action-adventure that can be beaten in 1-2 hours.
The darkness-mechanic and the constant use of light sources really sets the tone and the gameplay and works really well. 
Worth some bucks and an easy and short recommendation for genre-fans!
[spoiler] And the derpy face of the archeologist at the ending screen is priceless! [/spoiler] This is a really solid game.  Nice bite-sized levels, very good music, and a fantastic aesthetic.  Well done to the authors.  Looking forward to the next one. short but enjoyable platformer with some combat. Keeps up a good pace and ends in about 2 hours. works great on Deck
 A fun and short adventure that anyone can complete in 1-2 hours and is absolutely worth the $5 asking price. I was pleasantly surprised with the game! fun enough and brief, but incredibly weird tonally. 

game culminates in an offensive last boss which is impossible to overlook in how gross it was. It's neat, short and sweet so not too much to expect. The whole lighting gimmick is neat, though starts to feel more annoying towards the end. Since it's so short it finishes before being a real frustration luckily.

Fun game I've lost count of how many times this game's progress has vanished and I need to start from the beginning again. 
Really destroys the fun out of it. IT HAD MY BRAN EXPLODE Angry Birds VR: Isle of Pigs is one of the best mobile to VR conversions that I've played. Putting Angry Birds in 3D does so much for the gameplay, and the level editor is a completely unnecessary but fantastic edition. Resolution Games genuinely cooked with this. It's baffling that I'm saying this about an Angry Birds game, but this might be one of my favourite VR games. I had a few of the Jenga licensed Angry Birds Star Wars sets when I was younger, and Isle of Pigs feels a lot like playing with those did.

The third dimension adds a lot more variables to collisions and physics than the original Angry Birds, which does make some levels feel a little bit like RNG, but this is basically my only issue with the gameplay. I didn't aim for 3 stars on every level, so this didn't bother me as much as it might've otherwise.

Technically, the game runs great. I played it at 220% res on my RTX 3060 (because why not) and maintained a consistent 90FPS throughout. It's an incredibly simplistic game visually, but the art style is really nice.

My only technical gripe with the game is that the level editor floor appears somewhat hazy, because an effect applied to this floor isn't mirrored correctly between both eyes. This doesn't massively detract from the experience though, and isn't present in the main game at all. The level editor is really impressive and intuitive regardless.

Isle of Pigs is somewhat pricey for its length, but every VR game seems to be now. I think it's worth the price that it often goes on sale for, but I got it even cheaper than this due to the fact I had Acron: Attack of the Squirrels from a Humble Bundle. it doesn't matter how many times you play angry birds,you always play with a smile on your face and chuckle to yourself. One of the all time great games, so simple yet sometimes so hard. Good for when you have a spare ten minutes. 10 out of ten You have a slingshot and you shoot birds with it at green pigs that live in forts. Not much else to the game as far as I can tell. My only complaint is that the birds don't seem very angry. They wave at you kindly before you smash them against various building materials. The pigs are the angry ones since you're firing high velocity birds at them. It should be called Angry Pigs.

 I've gotten this game awhile ago, but still love to come back to it once in a while. This game works great with the minimum requirements (GTX 970), and had a blast! Would recommend. ITS A DREAM COME TRUE!!!!!!!",0.03550472255017709

374010,Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective: The Case of the Mummy's Curse,game,False,"8 Jun, 2015",Adventure,"The London Times started it all ‚Äì calling the murders the work of an ancient Egyptian curse. I accused the tabloid of capitalizing on the superstitions of the populace. Yet, three men were dead, with the wrappings of a 4000-year old mummy binding their fates together.","great game! loved it. I wanted to like this game, as I'm a fan of anything Holmes and enjoy old FMV games, but there really isn't much of a game here. It's an odd game that rewards you for playing as little of it as possible. You get a better score the less ""clues"" you need to solve the case, which functionally equates to you NOT following every lead or interviewing every suspect / expert. This might work well for the board game, but makes you feel like you are skipping most of the video game to get the best score (and the associated achievements).

If you can get past this, many of the FMV scenes are charming and the costuming is nice. But you can easily finish this ""game"" (more of an interactive movie, really) in well under an hour. I would only recommend picking it up on sale or as part of a bundle if you're curious, but it's a pretty shallow experience overall. Not much here, but for a Sherlock completionist, might be worth a couple dollars just to see what it's about. really enjoyed the FMV scenes, and found it overall very charming! but the game itself leaves a lot to be desired, very short and the solution is obvious. 
 Check it out if you enjoy Sherlock Holmes or cheesy FMV games but i wouldn't really recommend it for anyone outside of that demographic  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø I have to give it a negative review, because of the subtitles not working and some other bugs. In this game you have to pay good attention to what is being said by eyewitnesses and suspects. The sound quality isn't good enough to hear exactly what names are being mentioned; so subtitles are really needed to find the next person you want to interview. There also seems to be quite a lot of side stories that are ignored by the game and where you don't get any satisfying answer to what was going on. I really appreciate having these episodes of early 90s FMV available on a modern platform and wish I'd played them earlier.
Are they perfect games? Not at all. Without the achivements popping up when you find the required clues, figuring out the optimal solution would be very tiresome. Typical 90s extending the gameplay through trial and error.

But it is worth it to explore the different performances and cute little side stories. I give the games a lot of credit for letting you follow useless clues way further than you need.
Tho I see no real reason to split it up into 3 games, and thus will review them as one.

[b][u]The Case of the Mystified Murderess[/u][/b] - 
By far the strongest of the offerings, even if the solution is very silly.
It has more complex storytelling and avenues to explore, and the actors you talk with in this one are some of the strongest performances. You also get to solve both crimes related to the case.

[b][u]The Mummy's Curse[/u][/b] - 
In the middle, it has the least requirements to solve the case, and leaves out one of the biggest clues from the required scenes.
It also keeps bringing up a side-plot that goes nowhere and has no resolution (tho we can assume who the culprit is). But it relies on context clues and reading the newspaper more like a puzzle, and the murderer is pretty fun.

[b][u]Tin Soldier[/u][/b] - 
I find this the weakest of the 3 cases for 2 main reasons - we solve it not through dialogue but through exploring an empty room, and getting to that clue is a massive reach. Second we just completely ignore a 2nd murder that is directly related to the first. I guess it is not technically required to solve the case, but it is unforgivable that even if Holmes does visit both [spoiler]Matin[/spoiler] and [spoiler]the Count [/spoiler] and is told straight up [spoiler]Vladimir killed Matin to get the ruby back[/spoiler] he never reports it to anyone.
I do appreciate that we are allowed to visit all the surviving lottery ticket holders, and will give it credit for having probably the most grounded motive of the 3.

I reccommend these 3 episodes to anyone interested in FMV games and schlock, and wants to play just to experience all the different performances and actors. It is not worth it at all if you want to play just to get a good score. Everything plays out well in this game except the scoring system. Recommended overall not my kind of game style First of all - remember this is a 6 year old game, utilises videos and text instead of animation, and covers a single case!

Now that's out of the way... it's short, but not bad for a single session of gaming.  If you enjoy the board game (221B Baker Street, etc) or the interactive movie version of Clue, then you'll enjoy this one.  It's a lot of reading, picking out the relevant names and following up only on those.  As it's 'demerit point' based, you want to have as low a score as possible - so visiting the cheese shop is really unnecessary (yes, I went to the cheese shop!).

Is it as good as the other SH games?  No - I liked animations and various dialogue options.  But that's not to say that it's not worth playing in its own right, as long as you think of it as a board game with videos (which are coming back in vogue, I  hear...) Great fun, more complex than I expected. You just need to not worry about your score.
They have made real effort re mastering thre video. No. Just no. I have hard times calling this a game, but whatever. Flaws in it are multifold, lets just go down a list.
First, there is no handling of physical evidence. Everything is done by dialogues.
Second, there is no hint of action. Be it chase, escape from locked room or trap, fight with perpetrator... These are part of Holmes universe! Yes, I know, the whole budget was consumed by shooting FMV sequences with live actors, I have no problem with that. But that leads to most catastrophic flaw: The goal of this game, inasmuch there is one, is to solve the crime with least possible amount of actual investigating! If you go around and interrogate people in your directory, you are presented with extremely condescending end, calling you ""armchair detective"". Which is EXACT OPPOSITE of what it should mean!
A.C.Doyle created Sherlock Holmes as tireless investigator, going around days and weeks, investigating, interrogatin and staking out suspects and witnesses, and closing cases with severe sleep deficiency and physical exhaustion. Here, the ""correct"" end is closing case without any work done!  Speedrun of this game would take literary seconds! I believe the game can be finished with maybe dozen mouseclicks (did not try). 
I am sucker for all things Sherlock and this has NOTHING to do with this character. I am going back to games from Frogware.",0.06395021070578392

Her relationship with him heats up, becoming more and more intimate with each phone call and private chat.","I don't think it lives up to its own potential, but I still appreciate it for what it is. Another reviewer remarked on the game making them reflect on their own experiences growing up with online gaming, and I felt the same way. It can't be denied that it is at least somewhat compelling, but I feel that it could have done more.

This is less of a ""game"" and more of a ""minimally interactive movie"" / ""short story told through the medium of 'video game.'""

It's worth checking out, but don't let expectations drag your experience. It's an artistic expression of a very real and vulnerable experience which its composer brings her full Self forward to perform and express, and this takes far more courage to perform than any courage it takes to drag it all down in an anonymous review. not good It's important to know what you're getting into here. This is a very different sort of game. I had wanted to to play Cibele for quite a while after writing an essay on 'Tacoma' in college which Nina was also involved in. Quite simply, Nina Freeman has made an absolute work of art in 'Cibele'. While short, it is sublime. I think she has a lot to be proud of in this title. A marvellous game and I hope to find many more like it. If you are open to becoming immersed in a story of great quality, go for it. Nice little indie game. this is a very special game. it's awkward in all of the right ways to really show what falling in love for the first time in your life looks like at this point. play it if you enjoy vignette style narrative design. voice acting is a little one note though :/ It's more of a short story told through an interactive format. You play as Nina who wants to [spoiler]be in a relationship with some internet loser who has sex with her and then dumps her[/spoiler]. There is minimal gameplay which consists of playing a game within a game which is really just clicking. The entire game consists of clicking and looking at things to let the story unfold. I will not speak to whether or not I recommend this game because it depends what the user is looking for in terms of expectations. It is a pretty odd experience, but I do appreciate that video and photographic elements are incorporated into the piece as it adds an element of authenticity and vulnerability in a unique way. It's not really a ""game"" but more of a ""short movie"" with minimally interactive parts. The story does not branch, so the interactive part doesn't change anything because there are no real choices to make. It's a single, linear story that takes about an hour to complete.

I bought it on sale for $4.49 and I felt that was still a little high for what I got. meh I love that indies make such *weird* stuff. This game is definitely unusual.

It's a walking simulator, except, instead of walking setting the pace, beating up grindy mobs in an MMO sets the pace. So, as the pacing mechanic, each act has you control your character to team up with your romantic interest to kill multiple small mobs, in order to be able to attack a boss, which you have to fight three times in each act to kill it. While fighting, you also hear the audio of voice chatting with them as you play together.

Interspersed with this are text messages, emails, and images sent to you by friends. Through this multimedia approach, the story is told. It's not a great or deep story. It's just the story of someone's first online relationship, banal as that might seem.

There are reviews saying this is the worst game people have ever played... and I can totally see that, if they were expecting a game. It's not a game, really, any more than any other walking simulator. So as a game, it's utterly lousy.

But, as a story, it's also a genuinely lousy, tedious, bland, banal story. 

The plus side?
1) It's relatively short, maybe a couple of hours of clicky grind at worst.
2) It's an interesting approach to storytelling by an indie game dev, and I love how out of the box the thinking was with it, even if the implementation was pretty awful; bland, tedious and buggy. There's no ""save"" option, and when it crashed in the middle of the third act, and I restarted it, it had be restart from the beginning of that act.
3) It's allegedly a ""based on real life"", and I felt that believable. The art, photos, dialog, etc feel ""real"" (because they are without exception utterly crap, as real life typically is), as if the developer just took images from that time from their hard drive, and used them as the game's graphical assets. That makes the game feel somewhat voyeuristic, like poking around someone's hard drive or email. That, the ""slice of real life"" aspect, is what just barely redeems it.

So, it's a terrible game, used to deliver a terrible story, with terrible assets (apart from the music, which is not my thing, but at least not technically awful). A lot of its sales are probably from the ""nudity"" tag (there's no significant nudity: a little cleavage but no nipples or genitalia). It's about as devoid of eroticism as a soap opera, and I don't mean the fun Latin-American kind, I mean EastEnders on its most boring days.

AND YET... I don't regret the time I spent playing/watching this, because from a game design point of view, it was a really interesting idea, and because it felt like someone telling a simple story about their own life, in a heartfelt way. Sure, it's not a ""five stars, 95%, must play"" game. But it's also not a ""700 hour commitment"" game. It's a casual, indie narrative game, and within that niche, it's more ""okay"" than ""bad"".

So, cautiously, I recommend the game. I have mixed feelings about this game. On the one hand, I'm glad it exists. It's cool to see different kinds of games, different stories. I'm always in favor of pushing on the boundaries of what games are and what kinds of stories they can tell. As others have mentioned, it's a very cringey game, but that's sort of the point. It feels very real in that way.  

On the other hand, there's not much here. It's a very *small* story, and one that at times lacks depth. It feels like a first draft in many ways. Some interesting ideas, well-delivered, but incomplete. 

I'll tenatively recommend Cibele as a game that tries something different. Is it ultimately successful? I'm not sure that it is, but I think this is a place where it's worth rewarding points for trying.",-0.023571208112874803

2835480,Vectored Armada,game,False,"1 Apr, 2024","Action, Early Access","Architect autonomous battleships. Send them on a campaign against deadly opponents. Watch and cheer as they dominate, or cry as they explode. Obliterate dreadnoughts. Configure intelligences. Master weaponry. Free the Great Skies. THE OPPRESSOR MUST FALL.","Pretty fun ship building/fighting game reminiscent of Reassembly, could use some finer AI tuning/more specific behaviors but I'm liking it so far. Vectored Armada is a game that has a ton of building options and allows you to build things far more complex and beautiful in structure compared to games like reassembly and nimbatus. the only real complaint i have is that the game is slower-paced than the previously mentioned games. if you wanted reassembly but more strategic and more focused on fleet play, this is the game for you - i personally like it and would recommend, but its not for everyone Proud of you Luke! Very fun even at this early stage and seems perfect for future development I've only played a little bit of VA, but it's pretty alright so far. My biggest complaint are simple UI/control issues. They're the sorts of things that can be fixed easily, and I've already passed my feedback on to the developers in their discord.

Games in this little niche genre are vanishingly rare. I really like the ability to attach custom UI to the ships, and watch them battle it out auto-battler style. So far, this game has a lot of promise and I look forward to seeing what it becomes. tl;dr: It's inexpensive, sandbox-y, and fun. Do recommend.

Vectored Armada is, on the surface, a relatively simple and straightforward sandbox shipbuilder and combat game. The blend of free-form building (comparable to similar games Cosmoteer and Reassembly) combined with the campaign intended to give a variety of challenges (not unlike Gratuitous Space Battles) place this game in a comfortable niche where low mental investment is required to play and have fun, but at the same time ruthlessly maximizing combat efficacy of ships is a plenty-valid way to approach the game.

But one of the ways where this game really knocks it out of the park is 'freedom'. The game hands the reigns almost completely to the player to allow them to customize the aesthetics of their fleet. From coloring individual blocks of the ship to mounting weapons on hardpoints placed on blocks that normally wouldn't allow it, the game lets you, the player, have the final say. Honestly, for an early access game that follows Reassembly quite nicely yet with a different tone and I like the hands off nature of the combat, seeing it as it is now makes me very excited for the future of the game, I hope others find it as enjoyable as I have so far! Fun game. Harder than initially expected. 
Watching one of your fleets finally defeat an opponent who's slaughtered your past 15 fleets feels good. I put 100+ hours into Reassembly, and I loved what it almost was. But the tournament mode didn't quite satisfy after I'd gotten bored with the endless mode, and the balance was broken once I let the AI take the reins. I picked up Cosmoteer to scratch that itch, and it's a good game, but it wasn't really what I was looking for. I think this is it. It's like Gratuitous Space battles in that you put together fleets based on a point cap and let them duke it out based on preset orders, but with Reassembly-style ship design and 2D physics. Already in a playable state and gets frequent updates. If you enjoy Reassembly or Cosmoteer, give this game a run. It's simple and straight-forward, which honestly is just what this genre needs. Don't let them simple graphic designs put you off, it's a fun builder and it plays well. It is early release at the time of my writing this and it does have some rough edges, but a lot less than many EA games I've played. 

The freedom of design and the ability play around with designs till you get what you want to work the way you want is a nice bit of freedom from games that demand you do it X way or no way. And while the dev has stated that a slim roster of weapons and utilities is better than an overwhelming amount, there's still a ton to work with.

Speaking of the dev, props there for being responsive and friendly. I'd found and posted a bug in the discord and got a reply within minutes both acknowledging the issue and that it was being worked on, on top of being friendly about it. It's hard to ask for more from a dev with a game just released. And the fact that that's the only bug I've run into so far speaks well of the state of the game currently.

I hope this game gets the attention it deserves and continues to grow. Want to build ships and blow them up? Welcome aboard!",0.06338588588588588

Aboard your truck, travel to the far north, meet colorful characters, and face the creatures inhabiting these sacred lands.","When I found out about this game I was impressed by hand drawn visuals that the game uses which told me that I had to buy this game as fast as possible. I was introduced to amazing story with your choices impacting the story with gameplay which revolves around choosing the right path and managing your truck while accompanied by great soundtrack driving through expanses of Russia. When It comes to characters They are well written and designed there are characters you will like but some you will hate but there are even characters you won't feel anything towards them.

Over the positive things there is also one negative and that's the Photo Mode. Every time I press P It won't stay that way when I press for example f12 to take the screenshot, so when I tried to take any screenshots of the visuals that the game presents I always had like bunch of screenshots with Bubbles and UI. 

But overall the game was perfection to the last bit. Firebird will lead you through a mystical journey in the ever snow part of Russia.
The art is amazing, the music mesmerizing and the writing inspiring.
The author could write touching characters, blending elements and symbols or the Russian folklore into a nowadays story.
The artist vibrant style really gives life to the characters and the beautiful landscape.

I also really the ""truck management"" part of the gameplay.  I was looking for a light story driven game and when I spotted Firebird the art style drew me right then and there. The vibe it was emitting was so enticing. Story was quite unique too. I think it was inspired by some kind of Russian folklore. That being said, the only minor issue of the game is that English translations have one or two mistakes, but it‚Äôs not something to fret. You can totally tell what the sentence means.
 Gameplay design was also very lenient, including the difficulty. You could also experience different story development depending on your choices. üôÇ Has everything one can ask for in a visual novel. The game is a full package, with a hint of strategy throughout to keep the stakes grounded, enthralling visuals, and a well written story. Would highly recommend for a blind play through! Nice take on a Russian tale. Paths were just rewarding enough to be worth it. Give it a try. An enjoyable choose your own adventure with mild branching elements. Like the excellent Black Book and the not so good The Sin, this is about the overlap between the modern and the ancient in the far north of Russia. The game art by professional illustrator Quentin Vijoux owes more to Quentin Blake than generic anime, which makes a nice change for a visual novel. The coldwave interludes are also very good. There are many interesting places to visit, which would require restarting the game several times to see them all, which I will save for the future. Delightful little VN based on old Russian fairy tales. You play as a woman trying to pay off her debt to a gangster by taking jobs with her truck, the Firebird. When a mysterious girl shows up one day offering a job in exchange for rare goods enough to pay your debt, you start out on a strange adventure through history and myth.  

As a fan of old Russian tales, I was already sold on this game, which is sort of like a Russian [i]The Flame in the Flood[/i] without the survival mechanics. But on top of the engaging and well-translated narrative, the art style has a special charm despite some truly dark subject matter, and the soundtrack is a bop! Dying just takes you back one stop to your last crossroads. No bugs to speak of. I finished it in about a hour and a half without rushing. Well worth the time if it sounds like your kind of game. Lovely game - atmospheric, illuminating and beautifully-designed. It starts slowly with some traversing back and forth between locations, but I was soon gripped and desperate to see where Mariska's journey took her next. The hand-drawn art is absolutely spectacular. I took so many screenshots, especially after discovering you can hide the user interface at any time. There's enough alternate choices and paths (and bad endings, some more prosaic than others) to merit at least a second playthrough. Really charming game!! You can finish it in one sit, took me three hours to get through, had a great time playing it. Lovely art style and story, nice to dive into a folk culture and mythology I don't know much about.",0.13559006627590695
501970,Phantasmagoria 2: A Puzzle of Flesh,game,False,"29 Aug, 2016",Adventure,"All Curtis wants is to live a normal, happy life, but something seems to have other plans...","1000/10 curtis rules and bi blob rules treavor is hot we love blob and that's about it Boobs and gore 10/10 When FMV games first became a thing there was night trap ,sewer shark etc. Those types of game continuously played...not only did you often miss the story (especially with night trap as youre looking in different rooms), but it made them very limited with very small choices, basically just creating a different video playing. The first Phantasmagoria was a step forward where you controlled the player, Phantasmagoria 2 went further still. Although you still have premade videos (just like cutscenes in any game), you have MUCH more choice in the game , and it does make a difference to the ending......this was rare in the late 90s.

There is a genuine mystery here, all you know when the game starts is that you were in a strait jacket in hospital, and you begin the game with very little else as to who you are. The unravelling of the mystery is really well done. The characters are good and , for a first, some of the acting isnt bad at all (a rarity at the time). For me though, the excellent sets and ambiance steal the show. The videos are really close to the gameplay graphics in look and feel (the videos are real video and gameplay is kind of green screen super imposed people on photo like computer drawn scenes....its pretty seamless and very well done. The interaction with objects including the computer on your desk is also well done. A lot of thought went into making this an engrossing and interesting game.
         
The game is also quite long which surprised me. Ok the video is grainy and has greatly reduced quality and colour by todays standards, but it still does the job of drawing you into the game.

I wont spoil the game, but it has many characters, not all make it to the end , this increases interest, when people keep dying it just adds more mystery. I love that you can change the path of your character too.

This is , for me, the most interactive FMV game I have played......and Ive played most. Whilst there are others which are excellent too, nothing quite catches the depth and horror of a Puzzle of Flesh : Phantasmagoria 2.

I first got the game when it was released in the late 1990s back in the days of Pentium 2 computers and slow  hard drives.....its a joy to play with an ssd today. 

If you love a great horror like scifi story with a number of clever twists, great sets and quite often decent acting, you will love this game.
An easy recommend and one of the best of the genre.

Please give us a remaster GREAT GAME! 
Takes me back to my teen years. But sadly the game locks up and crashes WAY too often. 
They're relying too much on DOSbox, which hasnt been updated in years..... and is obsolete. 
I can't even save my game easily..... which super sucks. *Played via SCUMMVM

As someone with a decent grasp on the adventure game and point and click genres, I found this game to be quite good, despite the playstyle being something I‚Äôm generally not a fan of. It‚Äôs a click and watch kind of game without any real puzzle-based mechanics or deep problem solving. Actual ‚Äúpuzzles‚Äù are few and far between and the ones you do get are either stupid easy or wtf. Given this major flaw for me personally, I still enjoyed this game for what it did give me. A story that kept me engaged despite not knowing what was happening towards the end, good characters/writing, upmost entertaining acting and cutscenes, and good pacing. People seem to argue over the quality, some because the game's progressive themes make them mad. This game is certainly worth playing and better than the first entry. Huh, that was weird Curtis... You're such a pretty girl, Blob. The lady in the first game did porn. 6/10 Absolutely Horrific! I LOVE 90's & early 2000's games. I played the 1st one and loads of FMV games. While I know they're supposed to be kind of campy and this game is old, that's not the issue. The problem is NEVER knowing what to do next! You finish a conversation, and you can't talk to that character anymore. Then you go around and come back and then you can suddenly talk with them again. And missing that tiny detail bottlenecks the entire progression of the game! Then missing other small details which seem to have no meaning to the story - only in the developers mind did make any sense - but if you miss it, you just end up going around in circles. I appreciate the production value. I am also grateful they are even making old classic games, many of which I love. It's better than them not making it. But this one is just a total clunker. Completely boring. But the WORST PART OF ALL is the ""Myst"" Navigation syndrome. The Navigation is beyond atrocious!! There are arrows going everywhere in all directions including diaganally.  And it gets super confusing where we're coming from and where we're going. I even checked the walk-through including a video walk-throught. But after a couple of hours, I just wasn't enjoying myself anymore.Farts!",0.061369880119880066

2530420,Fatermyth,game,False,"23 Apr, 2024","Adventure, Indie, RPG","&quot;Fatermyth&quot; is an RPG game that combines tabletop role-playing and adventure. The storylines of seven characters from different eras intertwine, depicting an epic of human heroes. The strategic battles with dice + skills add more challenges to the adventure.","I using a Minisforum V3, this game does not support touch screen and the stylus pen.
Still recommend it for the content, but i prefer touch screen game play. Super fun game with great story as well as art and game play, highly recomend! Fatermyth is a great game if you know what you're getting into. 

This includes:
‚Ä¢ Interesting, but rarely challenging dice TTRPG gameplay (Every character has a cheese strat- there are few fights that challenge or circumvent it)
‚Ä¢ A story that splits between seven protagonists. You go through everyone once, then go through 4 of them twice, then go back to the start to finish it off
‚Ä¢ Said protagonists barely meeting up in their own stories. 5 of those images up there ^ on the page only happen in the last ~4 hours of the game, and this includes the art and gameplay of the protags interacting with each other.
‚Ä¢ Stiff and passive English translation 
‚Ä¢ You (as a playable character) having to beat and charm a man in combat to have an ""intimate"" scene with him

I really don't think this is a bad game, hence the positive review, but it's certainly rough around the edges. There are still some untranslated ""pages"" of the story here and there (thankfully you usually don't lose much), and the overall English translation is written in a way I (personally) found severely unengaging and detached. There are exceptions to this- and the game is wonderfully written when it drops this, but it's not very often. I can tell there's a good story here, with every individual protag and overall, but it was hard to connect to. So, in a way, it's kind of a perfect representation of sitting on a boat while a guy tells you why you should care about all of these people. 

I would best describe this game as a severely railroaded D&D campaign with simpler mechanics. There are choices in this game for sure, but they barely ever matter. If you don't pick what the game wants, it tends to just kill you instantly. There are some situations in which this makes sense, but I got sort of sick of getting fail-states for menial decisions after awhile. The game wants to tell its story, and all you need to do is play the right moves and press the right buttons. 

My biggest active criticism of the game lies with my last bulletpoint. If you don't want to do that (and you have to play through that incident twice on both sides, same result), I wouldn't recommend the game. That incident [spoiler] becomes the basis of Teal Guy and Fox's (using simpler names for identification) relationship, and their second-half stories are about their blooming romance and fated destiny together. The game likes to call their initial incident passionate impulse, but the fact that Teal Guy had to be charmed and defeated for it to happen is... certainly something. I tried to avoid Fox throughout the entire rest of the game for this, to no avail. Gifting her the skinned corpse of her kin gives me a fail-state, and you can't progress to the last section of the game without grabbing her spirit... I just need my boy Bai Chi to find a better girl... [/spoiler] A real hidden gem. Anyone who is a little bit interested in a good story and simple yet quite unique card battle system should try this game.
It has its unique charm not many other game had, and I've played a lot of them. 

Story is split into different characters and you experience their journey one by one. 
And each and every one of them are powerful enough to make your heart beat faster. You can feel how much passion went into this small project

Just give it a try. If you can enjoy the battle system, you will absolutely love this game I honestly didn't expect too much from this game, the whole play dice on cards intrigued me but then I played the demo and what actually grabbed my real attention is that the story is amazing which more or less plays out as a visual novel with choices, deaths and failure states.
I haven't really played (or consumed much Chinese media) to begin with, but all this mythology I have never heard about just makes everything so interesting to me. The commentary from the Fisherman (the DM in the background) is also quite funny.

Also do have to say the story itself gets quite brutal (Ch.2 spoiler) 
[spoiler]R.I.P. Ji Yun, Ji Yu and Ji Feng :'([/spoiler] made me cry for an hour and also has quite some other dark moments but that definetly just adds to the fascination of wanting to see what's next. The failure states are also really intricate and detailed sometimes. Not just ""you died"" but several paragraphs of horrible things playing out.
The English translation - even though it's noted Alpha in the menu - is absolutely good, some obscure choices of words sometimes, but perfectly understandable.

The card art looks beautiful, and there is so many of it, even scenery you only see for like two paragraphs or so. I also haven't checked the artbook yet due to risk of spoilers.

The game itself does feel a bit janky with some effects, saving inside dungeons seems to run into issues and some of the effect text is really tiny but like those are the biggest issues I've came across.

Completion Edit: I have finished the game at this point, Dungeon saving no longer has issues. Missing text is barely a problem anymore.
The story was stunningly emotional, invoked feelings of happiness, grief, anger, so many tears and a desire to see everything through. Thank you so much for translating this and sharing your culture and mythology. The art is stunning and going into my wallpaper rotation. I learned so many new things too! ([spoiler]Metal[/spoiler] is an element!?)

Bai Chi <3 A card game rpg, with the genshin TCG dice system, which is cool. The interface is a bit weird, but intuitive. The translation is ok. ÂæàÂ•ΩÁöÑÊ∏∏ÊàèÔºåÂ∞±ÊòØËÅå‰∏öÂ§™‰∏çÂπ≥Ë°°‰∫ÜÔºåÈæôÂ•≥Êó†ËÑë2tk Only just started but all around loving it. The dice as your mana/points per turn is cool as heck and not to hard to pick up on. The translation is good so far. The subtitles cut off a bit on the screen when the pretty white haired man speaks to you, but other than that the game explains the mechs pretty well. You are told you can always go back to settings to find the help/tips again. The art work is so amazing!!!! Cool gameplay, never seen using dice as stamina before. The story is pretty good so far. It feels a bit like Hand of Fate. Worth a try. First of all the big question: Is the translation good? Yes it is.

The game is simple yet beautiful. Don't be deceived by how it looks like yet another Slay The Spire clone. The gameplay is very different and engaging. The dice system adds randomness, some of which you can mitigate by your skill choices and equipment. The start feels railroady because it is essentially a tutorial baked into the first run don't be alarmed.

The story seems good. As explained on the store page it is based on Ancient Chinese mythology/history with the creator's interpretation and imagination thrown in.

Gameplay Loop:
1 - On the main map you chose which location to go. This part is linear.
2 - In each location there are story elements, which you access by clicking on their cards.
3 - Each Story Element(which can be a person, a location with people/shops/questgivers, enemy etc...) has its own small story. This part actually is reminiscent of Erannorth Games.
4 - Each Story Element can be solved by making choices, making skill checks, or combat.
5 - After completing a Story Element you gain experience, sometimes you also gain some loot. You gain skill points as you level up.
6 - You can spend these skill points on your character screen to create your own build. My favourite part: You can actually completely change the initial skills, don't like one? Just set it to 0 and regain its point investment. As you spend skill points your passive abilities also get unlocked(Don't be like me and wait 3 levels so that you can buy that +1 dice)

Skill Checks: In this game skill checks are done via throwing dice. There are 6 faces on dice: Yin, Yang, Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise. Yang Dices can be used as substitutes for any other dice except Yin. You have 1 chance to match the required dice type to pass the check. Basically Yin is 1, Yang is 6. Yin is normally unusable but the skills that can use Yin are usually very strong.

Combat: At the start of combat rounds you roll your dice. Each round you also have 3 reroll options and you can use/lock the dices you like before rerolling. You have all your skills available to you. However to use them you must pay their dice cost. This part is similar to Immortal Way of Life's combat. As you level up(or equip related items) you gain extra dice throws or dices of one type so that tutorial episode dice starvation will soon be going away don't worry.

For 5$ this game is a 10/10 buy. 

Note: The game sometimes feels like it is stuck during the start but after a minute or so the menu appears. They probably forgot adding a loading bar at the very start. Don't let this discourage you. It might also simply a me problem but just writing it here in case someone else encounters it.",0.07117179044913416

It's a race against the clock as you completely destroy luxurious apartments in an attempt to make as much money as you can, and buy the biggest arsenal of tools to do the job!","Crash !! at elevator good idea, could be fun - but unfinished prototype with a lot of bugs and undeveloped game haptics (with using valve index controlers). Too bad! i would have loved it! Abandoned early access game with a pricetag that feels fair...
 
I think hotel rnr is a much better game in terms of game but I won't lie that I do think there is fun to be had here. The levels are packed with detail and look nice, especially the glass and as comments mentioned I experienced no crashes. I had to use virtual desktops boot option to get sound working (directly opened from steam had issues) and the teleport only control feels very early VR.

But for $5 there is a lot of weapons and a lot to destroy that I feel would justify the pricetag if you can handle the jank... and honestly that's the biggest issue for me, it feels so creepy despite not supposed to feeling that way like the sound effects and atmosphere, it doesn't feel like a relaxing place it feels like the hotel in the shinning, speaking of which I never saw the ghosts but I did avoid the attic in the second level as it looked like serial killer den from what I could see.

So while I would say fixing the controls would be nice I think the developer likely realised the project just wasn't working. My advice, find or unlock guns and shoot everything and just try to have fun for $5 or so its hard to ask for more. lemme smash Got a refund coz it wouldnt load up a single stage without crashing, and it aint my high end computers problem. What i saw everything looks way to big, like im a small person who climb up Jacks bean stalk and live in a world of giants, everything is over sized or under, had a hard time finding a middle ground, but dnt take away from the game coz it didnt even load a single stage for me in the time i played. Doesnt mean the game is bad. Cant recommend something that didnt work. This game would easily be in my top 3 if it didn't crash ALL THE TIME. I've tried reinstalling it. I have a 1080 graphics card. This is the game I would show all my friends if it wasn't broken. We allow our two young sons to vent their destructive urges in this game.
Leaves them both tired and smiling.

Catch it on sale, game is fun but content is short for the current $15, unless you have a need to vent by breaking things

Requests: additional levels and weapons, perhaps some challenges or storyline. I LIKE IT! SUPER FUN! heres a link to me playing it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irg6_9D9DFI Fun frolic of destructive mayhem at the moment - knew what i was getting from the store video so hard to be disappointed!  At this very early access stage you have access to a very large apartment - complete with its own bowling alley!  I've seen flat out virtual spaces that offer less than that so its already a win for me.  The game promises some massive updates and a lot of additional content to come and the Devs seem eager to listen to feedback so everything positive for the future. 

OH WAIT i forgot the game!  So yeah you just absolutely TRASH the place :P  Everything you destroy earns money for your savings which you can then spend in the apartment complex elevator on bigger badder weapons each of which have their own damage level to cause more chaos :P  
***TIP: just click/tap on the weapon to equip it - don't get distracted by the sign that says grip it - if you hold down the button you dont equip the weapon and will just get frustrated - my first two playthroughs were barehanded because i hadn't figured this out...though that did mean i got to trash the place with a washing machine i picked up so theres pros to that too!  ^_^ ***

The whole things tied up with a neat little bow of a Tony Hawks style mission objective screen where theres hidden things to find and do around the level to clear those objectives off your checklist within a very small window of time (ie. hit Steve Jobs picture with an Apple :D) <-- this alone adds a lot of replayability and a good sense of humor to the game. so bought it and played bout 30 mins of it so far theres only 1 room and i dont know how you get other weapons besides the hammer ... theres tons of weapons but not available i wanted to use the guns so i thought u had to save money to unlock well i made up to 900$ and still had to use hammer..... as of right now this game is not worth the price and still has bugs going on elevator is jittery and when u teleport too close to somthing it automactically breaks it without you trying to use the hammer to break things so in conclusion this game as of right now with little content is worth 7$ in my eyes... i can see it being fun and challaging once they add more rooms and more weapon unlocks and fix the bugs out then it will be a pretty decent game.... i hope the devs get a move on and are fast like some of these other devs on there games .. until then i cannot recommend this game but i wont ask for a refund cuz i have hopes this will be all fixed",0.02952447196363128

[b] Horror/Surrealist centered Curator: [url=store.steampowered.com/curator/43071910/] KuriKuration[/url] [/b] game of the year (44 B.C) This was awesome, QIUTAIXU STUDIO is quickly becoming one of my favourite devs, cant wait to see what they do next :D 
Âú®ÂºóÈõ∑Ëø™ÁöÑ‰∫î‰∏™Êôö‰∏ä !!! Silver souls is legitimately one of the worst games I‚Äôve ever played it‚Äôs so bad it defies reason. It‚Äôs baffling how anyone in their right mind could make such a complicated series of bad design choices in a single product without their brain prolapsing out if their head.

First of all I‚Äôd like to say the game advertises English translation; which is half correct the entire menu is in what I imagine to be Korean. Wow, great, I love navigating a menu with 7 different tabs on the starting screen in a completely foreign language! I can forgive that though with enough trial and error you can beat anything! ;) anyway all the voice acting is subtitled in Englis! Too bad the story is completely nonsensical. I cannot tell you anything that happens after multiple hours playing your character just kind of exists in different worlds. Which by the way I forgot to mention there‚Äôs a level select. In a horror game. The battlefields of jackson pollucks abstract veitnam, In the basement of some dudes house, and a super market. Okay whatever I can deal with errant scenery changing re8 has plenty of that. So in the battlefield you just hear gunshots wizzing and screamin while the most generic score you‚Äôve ever heard rambles on in the background. I would mention the graphics here but it kind of looks like cat vomit. Anyway once you are done you are greeted to a dusty basement with an old disembodied man talking to you. He says some moronic shit about deities or something,‚Äù you don‚Äôt care‚Äù your protagonist suggests getting a flashlight. Press E to pick up. Okay, so you press E. Oh wait that doesn‚Äôt work. Okay so you press shift followed by right click followed by enter and after slamming your head into the keyboard for an hour you discover, shockers, the dev didn‚Äôt even program a way to pock up the flashlight. Amazing, truly astonishing. Whatever back out go to next level. Super market. Admittedly, this is the best section in the game watching the cars go back and forth is one of the funniest things I‚Äôve ever seen in a video game. You try to walk in but the gates are locked by turnstiles wow! Great design. So you have to go around the back of the super market. Wherein, you learn there‚Äôs a demon lady your protagonist wants to get with meat style. Then, you get boxed into a room while loud sounds play, the demon lady flies around, red lights flash. Then you stop playing because you‚Äôve already waisted enough time on this pos, and now you‚Äôve doubled that waisted time by reading this review, and I‚Äôve waisted triple that time writing this. Anyway this game sucks and should never be played by anyone. It will only let me pick yes or no in terms of recommendations, but if I could I would like a board of public officials to do an investigation and give whoever made it a restraining order from ever being allowed in the same room with a computer ( or me) ever again really good game please make more like this one please. i really enjoyed this.

Highly recommend for strategy fans. 10/10 would recommend!"" interesting RPG with a non-linear storyline. Choices matter, but some elements feel a bit repetitive. Still worth trying out ""The path to domination"" is yet another construction kit template copy+paste from serial shovelware pushers, Seaborgium Entertainment/khukhrovr.  These guys do nothing but copy premade game templates and game tutorials, fill out a few things/stamp out basic levels using the construction kit templates, slap on an asset flipped set of sprites/assets, and dump them on Steam and into cheap nasty shovelware game bundles as cash grabs.  Trying to get paid for someone else's game templates, assets... at best, this is shovelware, at worst, it's a scam/cash grab.

This time the Russians behind khukhrovr made a low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flip, one of literally hundreds spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, ""Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.""  Like all RPG Maker ""games"", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.

The only notable point of interest with this asset flip is the ""developer"" asset flipped a different asset pack from the usual stock RPG Maker asset flips to make it look more western.  It's still garbage, but check out this asset flip scammers rap sheet below. 

As with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for ""professional"" game development.

Like most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.

khukhrovr/Seaborgium Entertainment have shown a repeat pattern of unethically dumping other people's work onto Steam as a cheap, nasty cash grab, through this account or through closely linked/alt accounts.  Here's some examples so you can see for yourself:

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 3 players, and the worst part is these weren't genuine players, these were the Russian fake review accounts that the developer paid to make the fake reviews.  Since the fake reviews are all done, now the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

It's also important to note the ""developer"" here has connections to a number of shady Russian asset flippers and review manipulators who show an organised pattern to scam and defraud gamers with fake reviews and asset flipping the work of others for profit.  While reviews are about the games, gamers should be informed when developers act unethically.   Whether these connections are the same developer using multiple accounts, or just working closely with other unethical developers, gamers should be warned about the harm to gamers by this developer and their associates.  Buying games from unethical developers puts your money at risk.

The ""Positive"" review score on this game should be disregarded due to this blatant, unethical review manipulation.  This is done to deceive and scam gamers into paying for a bad product.

""The path to domination"" is relatively cheap at $1 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, and the questionable ethical nature of the developer and/or their associates (as outlined above), this is impossible to recommend.  Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.

[b][quote][url=https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile]Profile Features Limited![/url][/quote][/b]Valve have marked this game as ""Profile Features Limited"" at the time of this review.  This is usually caused by poor sales figures and low community acceptance for the game (to date).  Until this status changes, this game will not give you +1 to your Game Collector badge count, appear in profile achievements or any other Steam meta-accomplishments, nor can it be displayed in some profile showcases.  If these factors are important to you, it may be worth holding off before buying this game.
 Cheap RPG, worth its price. Lots of quests, some with humor. A couple of nights to play will do.

821500,Ria's Hook,game,False,"4 Apr, 2018","Action, Adventure, Indie",Ria's journey to the strange storm...,"Ria's Hook is yet another of literally thousands of 2D retro platformers infesting Steam and lowering the average quality of all video games everywhere.  This one eschews the garbage pixel ""art"" that goes hand in hand with the thousands of amateur made platformers infesting Steam for some hand drawn art, and it's true anything is better than pixelcrap, but it's still not a winner there.

Since the graphics are a fail, that leaves gameplay to try make up the difference, and it doesn't.  This Korean made platformer focuses on a hook swing mechanism, and hook swing mechanisms are not what was needed to revive the old, dead, obsolete platformer genre.  I'd just like to point out 3D graphics hit mainstream in the late 1990's and 2D graphics never, ever had a comeback, so it's unclear why amateur developers haven't gotten the memo.  Anyway, deficient graphics, deficient gameplay.  Let's go into a bit more depth on the technical defects. 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

The game is comprised of somewhat mediocre hand drawn 2D illustrations instead of professional looking 3D game assets.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget to arrange someone who can create graphical assets properly, or lack of talent.  Regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is very low, beneath what PC gamers have come to expect in this era of cutting edge photorealistic 3D graphics.  At least it's not pixel ""art"", but if you're looking for contemporary, immersive visuals, this game is a fail.

While there are options to change the resolution for the game, all this does is scale up the simplistic 2D art assets used to make the game, which makes little or no difference to the graphics quality.  Without any other substantial graphics tweaks, it's not possible for gamers to improve the lacklustre 2D visuals.

The controls and game handling are notably very floaty and imprecise.  It's janky and unsatisfying to play... and any experienced gamer will tell you, the handling, responsiveness and general gameplay feel of the control scheme must be well polished for this kind of game to succeed.  Unfortunately, this is something the developer seems to have phoned in, with little to no apparent gameplay testing or polish done.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, left handed gamers or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

This looks a lot like it was designed for consoles, but released on Steam instead by mistake.  While this is on PC, it has all the hallmarks and deficiencies of a console game, from the clunkier than needed control scheme to the less than cutting edge graphics.  There's 10's of thousands of PC games on Steam, and PC gamers deserve only the best.  This might not appeal to many gamers due to the lack of PC-centric design.  It's unclear why this never made it to the video game console appliances it seems to have been designed for.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The game never really caught on with the millions of gamers on Steam, with a very low peak player count close to launch, and then just a handful of players launching this game every couple of days.  This is undoubtedly caused by factors such as those raised in this review.  It's always helpful with buying decisions to consider how popular and successful the product is, and unfortunately while this did accumulate a few participation trophy reviews, overall, people just aren't using it.

So, should you buy this game?  Is this one of the best of the 100,000+ games on Steam?

Ria's Hook is relatively cheap at $3 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  This is also competing with over 11,000 free games available on Steam, many of them far better than this paid product. Within minutes it had me screaming and swearing and biting my hands.

2376740,200 DAYS Zombie Apocalypse,game,False,"4 May, 2023",Indie,You must survive a Zombie-infested world.,"Trailer fails to convey how much repetitive clicking is involved with playing this. It's actually not something you can play for too long at a time. The game looks nice, but reeks of free mobile game design. Those diamonds are a premium currency which you unlock through quests, but supply seems limited. Even though there don't appear to be any microtransactions, it feels like they were meant to be there at some point.

Generally, one of the bigger issues is that the game basically forces you to reset it every once in a while to progress. You get a reset at day 20, then 25, 30 and so forth. You get incremental stats bonuses for doing so resetting as soon as you can is the strategy to get further. After a couple of hours, it really doesn't feel worth repeating the same thing. This is an ordinary clicker ported from mobile phones. 
Nice pixel graphics, acceptable translation, addictive gameplay.
I recommend it, because there is no neutral rating.

Also can't save any loadouts, so you have to fill out the skill tree and gems before every fight... Really poorly made. 64 hours, completed (109%) the game and noticed many achievements I didn't have. 0 Game crashes. Great game.

Oh, it has DLC. Oh, it says I can use this to get the achievements from bosses I missed, like beating [name] without using Arrows! Sweet. Beat the boss multiple times, on Hard, even unbound the arrow key, didn't get hit (didn't use bubble either) did not unlock the achievement.

DLC Crashed multiple times loading the boss fight (after screen goes black to load from pressing ""B"" at the mirror to start, after selecting perks and gems, so you have to do that all over again. To add insult to injury, when you load back into the game, it will be sure to tell you, Challenge Failed :))

Don't buy this DLC if you're hoping to get achievements from the main game, even though it straight up says that it can be used that way. Very frustrating. My personal bewilderment at the fact that this is a DLC pack in the first place aside, Virtuoso is a very, very well made boss rush mode that is generous enough to go the extra mile and even offers up extra boss movesets like it's no big thing (which it is) 
Even just the fact that this DLC allows you to practice bosses without hassle and earn those challenge achievements alone would be worth it in my mind. 

At this price point I definitely recommend this to anyone that enjoyed the base game.",-0.028379629629629637

Angelo ‚Äì a young lazy bum-a-holic, oh sorry - a blogger, powered only by his blogging skills, must turn on ‚Äúpoint-n-click adventure‚Äù mode, go around the inferno, meet the locals, and somehow get back home. Enjoy Hell! We made it just for you.","Appealing art style but disappointing point-and-click adventure. Lacking English translation obviously not done by a native speaker. Some nonsensical and/or very far-fetched puzzles I would never have passed without a guide. Annoying characters, especially Angelo. Not enough hotspots and object descriptions. Very little music and it's mediocre. Way too short and the riddles were bloody easy unlike they've promised in their description! Heck, they didn't even mention that this was just the first chapter of their game! The graphics were great though. I really enjoyed this game.  Is it the best game ever made? No, but it is reminiscent of older point a click games that are not usually played any longer due to needing the old hardware to make them work.  I was disappointed that it ended in an unfinished sort of way, but that's just the way it goes. On an everlasting quest to find the perfect PnC games, I found this game on sale and decided, why not? I was a bit dissapointed with the outcome, I really wanted to like this game. It has been 2 days that I finished this game and I kind of forgot what the story was again. I forced myself to finish this game through the cringe. 

The story is about Angelo, this has-been youtuber desperate for views, being mistakenly taken to the afterlife by the Grim Reaper. He then realises that this is his chance to create a once in an ""afterlifetime"" :3 vlog that will reanimate his dying channel or blog or wtv. Soon after he meets Deemon, a former gangster turned demon after death and the two of them embark on a journey to.... well I actually don't know. Moving on to pros and cons I guess.

Pros:
- The animation is pretty cool.
- Some jokes are funny.
- Some puzzles are pretty witty.
- Cool pop culture references.

Cons:
- A lack of storyline, I don't know what anyone's motivation is in the story.
- Unlikeable characters (Overly edgy, outdated racial stereotypes and so on)
- PnC games are known for its nonsensical puzzles but these puzzles were TOOOOO nonsensical. 
- Walking back and forth between locations was poorly designed.

SPOILERS!
[spoiler]A lot of puzzles had me like... really? At one point I needed to get a balloon from this clown and the only way to do it was put TNT in his brain and blow his brains out? There is no clue or indication as to why I had to do that. [/spoiler]

A lot of puzzles didn't really guide me towards how to solve them. In most point and click games there are subtle hints. but in this game you are just smashing things together and hoping it works. As a PnC superfan, I kept getting distracted and delayed a lot to finish because I kept getting bored. 


Pros
 Just mediocre! It pains me to give a negative review to an indie studio, but there are just too many issues with this game for me to give a positive review. The graphics are fantastic -- kudos devs on the great art. But unfortunately that's pretty much the only part of the game I liked. The story is interesting in theory but kind of falls flat in practice. The puzzles are often nonsensical and poorly designed such that it's hard to know what you're supposed to do. 

But the worst part is Angelo. I hated Angelo so much that I didn't even want to get him out of hell. I understand that he's SUPPOSED to be a bad person, but anti-heroes have to have SOME redeemable qualities to work as good characters. Angelo is just obnoxious and insufferable, with too many cringy, forced jokes, and makes the game a pain to play EVEN AS a form of social commentary.

Also, the insertion of a Trumpian character is cringy and annoying. Give me abstract political concepts all you want, but inserting real-life politics in non-political games is usually just cringy. It's a nice adventure game. Not too long and not too difficult (although I used a walkthrough a few times, but that was also due to me being impatient).
The graphics are nice, the voicing is ok, the story is so so.
Too many 'jokes' about copyright to my liking, only once would have been more then enough.
Looking forward to a sequel (it does end, but it also doesn't, it's more like half way through).

I can't remember if I got it in a bundle or on sale. I see the regular price is 7,49 euro's at the time of writing. As I never buy games above 5 euro's I cannot really comment if the 7,49 is a good price. Personally I would wait until it's on sale below 5 euro's (as I still have such a large backlog anyway). I guess you'd call this the B-movie equivalent of a point and click game.  I thought the demo was humorous enough to try out the game on sale, but not sure about going full price with this one.

On the plus side is the artwork, which is colorful and very striking (thank you for not going pixel art!)

The English translation though is just wacky in spots, with many conversations and responses just not making much sense, although some of them come off as entertainingly wacky.  Voice acting is not too bad under the circumstances.

The puzzles are hit and miss, again not sure how they come up with some of these solutions.  Why do I have to give an item to the doorway that an NPC is guarding rather than the character itself?

Despite the shortcomings, it does seem to have a bonkers kind of charm that is memorable. the game gets stuck on the pc part but the demo works , whats with this ? It's short and funny. I did not expect something more from that, so I am fully satisfied with the expirience.",0.02094216873352212
1092050,Fire On Fight : Online Multiplayer Shooter,game,False,"15 Mar, 2022","Action, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, Early Access",&quot;Fire On Fight : Online Multiplayer Shooter&quot; is an old-school PvP and Player vs bot online multiplayer first person modern shooter game with stunning 3D graphics and captivating gameplay.,"I love this game. People still play it and if you to play offline there are bots to play against. if you play it on the steam deck make sure to change controller settings in the game by pressing the select button This is a game that really gets a grip on you... love this game... Steam's 2 hour Refund policy allows little time to really experience a game to give a ""fair"" review, but as somebody who has played and owned thousands of games since the 80s, I can often [i]feel[/i] when a game isn't worth my time.

There was a point where I've stopped playing newer Call of Duty games years ago. There's a myriad of reasons why I did, which I won't waste time and space explaining here, but ultimately, I sometimes like to find alternatives out there.

With Fire On Fight being barely over $1 on sale, I didn't expect much, but even then, I wanted my money back. What I will say is there will be a small handful of people that will enjoy this game - one player with map knowledge and a clearly better weapon was wiping out the whole room, which is an awful experience ESPECIALLY when a starting player only has one gun selection and you need thousands of points before you can buy another. Players with little money and a lower expectation of game quality might ""have fun"" in this, but even as somebody who has enjoyed a few low budget, poor quality Military shooter clones.

Most menus are scrolling, and don't properly use the giant wasted space it could, especially when choosing a map for Bot Match, which only shows small Thumbnail images in the scroll menu while leaving a giant empty space on the screen.. The resolution settings in the option didn't seem to have a resolution selected, but when i chose one, a dot did appear on it (It's possible I scrolled past the one it selected by default). The controls puts weapon swap on a single button (the 1 Key), including knife, so in my limited experience, melee is never used, and secondaries are only used if the player is out of ammo. Extra ammo seems relegated to magazine count instead of total bullets, so reloading then gun seems to throwaway the magazine completely, even if it has 60 bullets left. The AUG LMG not only has worse recoil than the standard AKM, but seemingly less damage, resulting in many deaths against bots and players alike due to just having a bad gun. Lobbed grenades might thrown too high, causing them to totally miss where you might expect them to go. Your own grenades also don't hurt you, in which I guess is a good thing, but an unexpected mechanic. Walking and running movement feels clunky and sluggish, but I suppose not terrible...just not good. I can feel the gunplay trying to emulate modern COD Games, down to the hit marker sound, but not quite getting there [i]feelwise[/i]. While I didn't see exactly how many points I got to unlock more weapons, it didn't feel like it was enough to unlock another weapon quickly, meaning somebody (or a bot) that has better weapons will outgun new players easily. The game also begs you to review it for a reward of currencies to unlock weapons and cosmetics - so some of these Steam reviews could very well be misleading. Ironically, just pressing the OK button to go to the review page does eventually give you the points for free, regardless of whether or not you gave the game a review - don't spend you credits on the AUG, its awful.....in fact the same can be said for the game. Don't buy it.

Truthfully, by only spending roughly $1 on Fire On Fight (due to a Steam Sale), most players won't ""miss"" the money they'll spend on this - so I'm sure someplayers are willing to put up with it's faults to have a CoD clone to run around maps and shoot people with guns - there are worse games out there despite this one being kinda bad. But in terms of these Sh**ty but fun, cheap FPSs, I'd much rather play Warmode or Combat Master personally. good fast easy fps as this game stands right now its superrrr jank, but i think with enough support for the devs they could make this work. great game Someting new :-) reason why i dont like the game is because the audio is bad and i was unable to  set my sensitivity and the graphics and frame rate was awful for the gameplay is good just need to put a bit more effort on gameplay type instead of free for all and team vs  team.The graphic is somehow is nice.And this will be much more fun if the put lotsa battlefield element such as warcry.

The irony is perfect: you play as a power-hungry mage while the developers play as power-hungry merchants extracting your resources piece by piece. You're not the warlock‚Äîyou're the sacrificial offering. Fun. solid Heroes of Might and Magic like I give this game a 4.5 out of 5. 5 out of 5 for value. I bought it on sale and then played it for 183 hours over the last month.
It is like Civ II meets Fantasy General. The different units are very fun to play with. It definitely has that ""one more turn"" addictive quality. There are a few minor bugs but they didn't interfere with enjoying the game. If you like turn based games and 4x4 strategy games in a fantasy setting, I think you'll like this. Units gain experience and you can also buy them upgrades as you acquire resources on the map. The AI is kind of dumb and there are limited diplomatic options but regardless of these facts, the AI's actions can keep you on your toes. I found this game very enjoyable. I have enjoyed playing this game for quite some time and I can tell you that you will enjoy it too. Have fun. UP FRONT NEED TO KNOW INFO:

It is like Sid Meier's Civilization and Majesty (Ardania world setting) got together, this was the result.  If you ever had an urge for a civ game that was high fantasy, this is the game for you.  Robust set of spells, bestiary, heroes, artifacts, and themes to immerse you in hours of role-playing as a magical emperor.

Pros:
-There are 4 races, doesn't matter what you start with, b/c as you conquer other races, you can use their cities to add to your growing horde/empire
-Learn spells that you can use all throughout the game, the land altering spells are my favorites, I can not describe to you the feeling of being able to raise land from the ocean and building a civ on it
-Units are unique and fun, the addition of the four heroes you can have with artifacts was a nice touch, I recommend the bunny rabbit if you have the gold to spare, he works great as a guardian of an interdimensional gate
-You will without a doubt have your favorite hero choices, mine are the Black Mages, they are cheap at first, but give them time to grow (give em better artifacts and grind them until they lvl up), they become basically walking/talking weapons of mass destruction, I got mine to a point where they are conquering whole nations by themselves w/o assistance
-Speaking of artifacts, one of the spells you unlock is a two-tier crafting session for new artifacts if you are having trouble getting any, you can make some gnarly stuff
-The interdimensional gateways was a nice touch, a very stargate sort of feel to them, you have not only your main world of Ardania but you can go to a couple other (albeit smaller) worlds, i gave one of them to my favorite black mage as a gift for centuries of loyal service to his shadow emperor (me)
-Again, the races are fun, you think you only have 4 options (that is true in terms of theme), but each ""race"" or faction has a plethora of sub-races, depending on your building options, I got a soft spot for the goblins and the ratmen are fun as well (they are basically pirates)
-game is affordable
-stays true to the Ardania lore, spells, and bestiary, i missed hearing that narrators voice

Cons:
-the only cons are have, i wouldn't really call cons, b/c these are things that can't be helped right now
-the graphics are a bit dated (but it is a 2012 game), every so often there will be a glitch where random strings of light pop up on the map (thankfully so far it has been rare, and not sure what causes it)
-i am upset that i never knew this game existed before randomly stumbling around for another 4X style game, b/c this was exactly the type of game i have been looking for a very long time
-ships are interesting, but a bit too weak at times if you ask me, that includes the bad-a flying ships you can get
-this is a personal preference, but this game would have knocked it out of the park with some steampunk (more airship) and gunpowder options as a late game thing, but that is a personal preference, all-in-all this game stayed very true to the creators vision of a high fantasy realm and game

Summation:
-this is a must have for your library, especially at the price it is going for This game is older now, but it still holds up really well. It has a feel of ""Civilization"" but with spells and magic thrown in. Easy to learn, and fun to play. An interesting 4X game with powerful terraforming abilities (you can create seas, remove mountains) and heroes who become invincible after buffs (like the invisible flying Granny Weatherwax killing a dragon with a single strike). The drawbacks are typical: the AI is dumb and aggressive, and the controls are poor, unfortunately lacking any gamepad(Steam Deck) support.

This is a fine expansion with an accelerated leveling and collection system that change up enough to make it fresh. The Yetis and in general the reskinned enemies are not threatening, which is a shame because they look cool in this spooky tribal aesthetic. Characters in the story are completely forgettable and there are no cutscenes or NPCs beyond a tied up person or two, so it feels like a fan mod than an official release.

This is the only DLC needed for 100% achievements. The survival element of this DLC is awesome and it is very nice that this is more than just new location. It is also very atmospheric. Unless you REALLY like the main game, and want the same guns, don't get this DLC. There's not much to do in the open world, the yeti's aren't very interesting or challenging, the missions are both boring and easy, and the base defense is incredibly mindless, losing it's appeal after the first time. At the very least they don't stretch everything too thin like in FC6, as the DLC is only about 3-4 hours long. If you still want to try it, wait for it to go on sale for $3 or so like I did. You'll see what I mean. This is just not fun.  Everything does so much damage and staggers you until you die.  The missions are all the same.  There is  way too much unnecessary rope parkour that is actually dreadful. Pleasantly surprised by this DLC, it's very well executed.

Short, concise and has a good flow.

Interesting story, very fun gameplay mechanics.

Ending is a bit ""wtf"" = as if devs ran out of time to wrap it up properly (again).

Overall, great DLC, very nice! A dull and repetitive dlc that is barely connected together with a needle's thread of a ""story."" Go do a random mission Ubisoft cooked up to pad time, come back defend outpost. Repeat ad nauseam. Very disappointing after the fun that was FC4. That was fun! Pretty solid DLC if picked up on sale.

Starting from nothing in a new map you have to build up dilapidated base and protect it for 5 nights. Do a couple of missions and it goes to free roam and you can go do mini missions to help gather resources  to upradd your base. These might be liberating supplies, finding/destroying weapons emplacement in the mountains or protecting Yak.  This allows you to fit mine fields, mounted guns or more fortifications/funnel points.   Then you can do the 6 or so main missions ending each night with base defending from 4 waves of attackers from different sides.

It‚Äôs fairly easy to die, so recommended to arse about doing the upgrade quests before the main stuff.  Map is big enough to be interesting without too much repetition . No fast travel, but plenty of snow Mobiles to get around rapidly. You can find weapons and rare guns here and there and upgrade them to suit your playstyle . Initially I found it too hard, until I realised I‚Äôd acquired loads of skill points and money and resources to beef myself up with more health/syringes and holsters. (Hadn‚Äôt played the main game for a few years and bought DLC now achievements added so forgot mechanics). Once you get a load out you like it‚Äôs quite satisfying.

Story is short and to the point. Bit more grapple and climbing than I‚Äôd like but it‚Äôs set in the mountains so expected. Nicely self contained and nothing missable.   Worth ¬£3 and doable in a couple of evenings or one big monster energy/pizza session. great dlc Great DLC, lot's of fun and I would recommend to buy it on sale. It's like a separate mini campaign.",0.0758180206318504

[b]Note:[/b]
All signs point to this game being abandoned. Purchase at your own risk.
What's there is serviceable, albeit flawed.


[b]Adult:[/b]
The main flavor of this game is father/daughter incest. With some player choices pointing toward future content about pregnancy, exhibitionism and MFF threesomes.


[b]Visual:[/b]
Sprites are used a lot, where characters are shown on top of backgrounds, instead of posed and rendered. This causes obvious issues with perspective, where characters seem unnaturally tall or small, or otherwise out of sync with their environment.
The animations aren't great.  Lots of clipping of hair and body parts. They also have robotic movements, mostly in the early game. It's clear the dev improved their skills considerably while creating this AVN.
Mandatory pauses are used during animations, blocking players from clicking to skip/continue.
Some textures are very low resolution, most noticeably the ground of the park.
There is some variety in body-shapes, though all LI have (very) large chests.  Estefania is built like an amazonian warrior, which fits her personality nicely. Fernanda is short and thicc. 


[b]Sound:[/b]
‚ÄúMeeting Her‚Äù has music and sound effects.  The music is fairly generic, but not too repetitive or distracting.
The music's volume isn't well-balanced, some tracks are much louder than others.


[b]Novel:[/b]
Albeit marred by its English translation, the writing isn't bad.  In the sense that it isn't perfect, but I've seen much worse.
Two main plots intertwine. One is the main character reconnecting with his long-lost daughter. The other has him investigate money laundering at his place of work.
The only mandatory LI in this story is Fernanda, the daughter. The MC's current girlfriend (Estefania) can be dumped at the start of chapter 3. 
Each LI has their distinct personality, hopes and dreams, and player choice determines how they act toward the MC.
Sadly, the MC is a bit of a mixed bag. He can appear juvenile and creepy, even if the player doesn't make creepy choices.  If the player decides to go after multiple LI's, the relationships will be based on lying and cheating.


[b]Conclusion:[/b]
I would've loved to see this game get finished, but all signs point to it being abandoned.  This isn't just a porn game, but a story about characters navigating their circumstances and history with each other.

Or, follow our [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/44944816-Lewd-Review/]Curator page[/url]. Buyer beware - this game is an abandoned Steam project. The developer has gone radio silent and that's usually an indication that the game is DOA. Its been my experience that most developers (with abandoned projects) use Patreon for making money. They then release an EA game on Steam usually with promise of grandiose updates / future content to milk some extra money. And then nothing happens. The latter happened here. Sadly as with many of these abandoned Steam projects, you get invested in the story and then...poof ""that's all folks."" Save your money (and time) on ""completed games"" or on others that actually get regular updates / feedback from the developer. Spanish AVNs:  Come for the girls, stay for the misogyny. its a good game for the price i'm looking forward to the next episode Fernanda is very pretty.
 What is it with AVNs that give you a character that is suppose to be the main character's friend, who is so stupid and such a scum bucket?  I guess stupid people hang out with stupid people, but I sure don't, so I don't want a character like that in the story unless I have a choice to have the main character completly avoid him.  Anyway, after 118 minutes I quit reading as I found the whole story to be stupid and poorly written and story boarded.  If you are looking for a good AVN on Steam, I would recommend the following:  Acting Lessons, Depraved Awakenings, Leap of Faith, Love Season, and Sisterly Lust. It's good and interesting story!  I'm excited to see where the story goes from what is in the game so far.  I've enjoyed the game and waiting for more of the story.  The game has really good renders and animations.  I recommend the game but keep in mind that it is EA so it's not finished yet. a bit boring imo..",0.004160266257040455
3010480,Shadow Trick,game,False,"11 Sep, 2024","Action, Adventure, Indie",Turn into a shadow and clear all the levels. Shadow Trick is a cute platformer game starring a wizard able to switch between the real world and the shadow realm. Keep an eye on your shadow and don't let your eyes trick you!,"I would say this game is pretty good all things considered, but the graphics feel a little difficult to look at. The displacement between the non-shadow parts of the level and the shadow parts of the level kind of make it a little difficult to sometimes judge where things truly are, but at the very least the game isn't too difficult. But I would say the displacement between the two can be a little annoying, I'm just saying. Overall a fun game, but not without issues. Mainly two.

1. If you're holding a direction and then take damage, you get ""stuck""? You can't just keep holding left/right after getting hit, you have to re-press it, which has gotten me killed on multiple occasions.

2. Snowflakes. Snowflakes, snowflakes, snowflakes. It's a cute novelty, but ultimately a bad mechanic. Any snow level that has them effectively traps you until the randomly generated snowfall allows you to leave [spoiler](which is annoying for the final boss since it uses them.)[/spoiler]

Apart from that, this is a cute little pixelated adventure with a simple but fun gimmick that you can kill an afternoon with.
Overall Rating: Good! I really like this game, but there are a few issues:

- I think the game needs cloud save data like other games. If you play on one device then play another you have to start over.

- If you change into a shadow, then climb onto a ladder, the character falls and gets stuck (I broke the game). Some type of glitch.

- I think there needs to be a UI for the moon objects so you know how many you have on each level (I keep forgetting how many I have after I grab them). But the moons aren't hidden so most of the time you won't miss them.

Audio
There is a weird glitch with the sound:
- If you start the game with your computers speakers, then sound will not come through on headphones.
- If you start the game with your headphones, then sound will not come through on computers speakers.
You have to close the game use the sound that you want, then start the game again. A short, casual platformer with a swap mechanic that's alright. Each level has 3 moon fragments to collect with all of them needing to be obtained to get the ending. Beating each boss without taking damage is needed to get all the fragments but none of them are particularly difficult. Good game, fun levels, great art style, just good all throughout. The game does get a bit frustrating though, especially in the boss levels. It's not even like a ""challenging"" frustrating, more of just annoying to try and get, especially with the boss levels. Though that it largely just a skill issue. If you want 100% but suck at platformers I would look elsewhere very charming and fun! definitely worth picking up This was an absolutely great game! some parts are kind of hard but you can get through after some while! I would recomend!! This is an awesome little game! Collect moons, avoid enemies, and alternate between background and foreground to progress safely. Recommended. short and sweet platformer! the music and art are wonderful, and the level design is strong! everything is built around the central gimmick of switching to and from the shadow, and for the most part is very solid. the last two bosses are a bit of a pain to complete without getting hit, but all in all kind of just serve as a small challenge (they are all 3-hit jump on head bosses).

if you enjoy short platformers with great cohesion and sense-of-self then i would highly recommend you pick it up! Like other Neutronized games before it, Shadow Trick is short and sweet. You can beat it in about an hour, but that's by no means a bad thing.

The main idea of turning into a shadow to find secrets and sneak up on enemies is pretty fun! I like that the levels make you use the two forms judiciously at times, and aside from a few frustrating choke points, the game's overall a good time!",0.047386392351752

Do puzzle in a new way! Advanced puzzle layout and involving game play will help you to relax after a hard-working day. Paris: Jigsaw Puzzles is designed for adults and for kids.,"Instead of an in-game puzzle selection menu where you can preview and pick a picture, you have to select one of the 15 pictures through the Steam launch option menu, and then remember that ""the nice pic I may want to replay is launch option [i]Picture 8[/i]"". There are much better, free jigsaw games you can play in a browser.

On the plus side, the whole game is only 6 MB on disc, a rarity nowadays. I also liked the uneven puzzle piece sizes. Some are huge, some are tiny.

In the end, the pictures provided are not impressive enough to overcome the problem of a non-descriptive text-only selection menu.

 That's one seriously basic puzzle game This is like when Icarus made those wings out of wax and shit but then he flew too close to the sun. It's like Adam Sandler, a tragically misunderstood, genius crafter who suffers for his artwork. I love this game more than Dark Souls II, and that's saying a lot. Only buy this game if you're prepared to cream your pants every time you turn this masterpiece on. I cannot choose my puzzles, get a got 2 pictures and on the second one, that was it, it pops up every time I open the game and i have no icon to click to choose another puzzle!  Very dissappointing It's a fun game to try and complete multiple puzzles. Comes with a diverse set of issues that wont leave you bored from the lack thereof. You can't see what you're going to make beforehand so you're left guessing. You can't save your puzzle progress at all so it is best done in one sitting.

Maybe we can see some extensions in the following days, who knows, eh? Chilling surrealiality Pure eyegasm, but not much of a game.

If you want an artistic game that doesn't actually have much gameplay (all you do is walk around, talk to NPCs and collect cans) and is very short.

Some would say it's not worth those 3 bucks, and they're probably right, but it's good to support creative developers so they can buy themselves that frozen pizza for 3 bucks. If youre high and thinking about buying it, im here to tell you to do it. I could live here. Beautiful, creative, surreal. Songs of the Lost, Museum of Symmetry, and Fast Machine (PALGAL on itch.io) are also lovely and worth your time I completed it twice in the time I've played. Fun art and really quite interesting for a small amount of time. If it goes on sale for more then 50% off I would say buy it if you like super trippy games and fun art. That was intense, I was not ready for that. Great experience, the art is amazing. Short but very enjoyable. A really trippy experience...i wouldn't reccomend if you don't like minimalist art tho...the game is a bit short, (max 30min of gameplay) but mostly you have to enjoy the art and the animations of it.",0.23940988835725677

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you. [table]

1031570,Hookshot,game,False,"25 Feb, 2019","Casual, Indie",Hookshot is a fun and challenging arcade game in which you must shoot the player progressively up the puzzle area sticking to the walls as you rise. The aim of the game is to reach the end of the level without hitting any spikes or obstacles.,"It's a bit tough to decide whether I should recommend this game or not. The concept is simple, and it could be a good time-killer. The music is average, and if you're into Steam achievements, you'll enjoy that aspect. However, I find the price of 2‚Ç¨ a bit too high for what the game offers. There are similar games available for much cheaper. It's fun, but not worth the full price in my opinion. 100% completion clocking out at 12 minutes is laughably low when the levels are so primitive you could probably crank out a couple of them in one evening with ease. It's functional, but not worth $3, as much as I want to support newrounds based devs being able to be paid for their work and people who are, from the looks of their libray, learning and experimenting, I felt a bit ripped off even only paying $2 on sale. so my rec is only under signifigant sale. this is a great game. it's short and simple, but it does *A LOT* right given that. the person who made it should be proud Very good game. Had fun to play it. Big Thanks to the developer for creating this game. I'd like to say yes, but the caveat is too great.

[h1]Puzzle game with a simple, neat idea[/h1]

You auto-rotate and can ""hook"" yourself to the wall being pointed at. If you hit a spike you die, and once you reach exit you win the level.

There are no time limits and the levels are fairly easy, so it's a rather casual game. I only wish the rotating speed was a bit faster.

As you complete levels (each of which grants an achievement), new features are introduced, like moving or disappearing platforms, timed doors and auto-rotating level. It's fine and cool so far.

[h1]But then it ends[/h1]

It lasted less than 15 minutes.

Twenty-four (24) levels sounds like a reasonable number, but they are short. Short is good for this sort of puzzles, but then I'd like there to be way more of them, something of the order of 100.

Therefore, it's [i]not[/i] worth the full price: I got it for ‚Ç¨0.50, which feels almost but not quite adequate to me.

There could be e.g. a challenge mode, say, with time limits or limited number of hookshots. Properly balanced, even the present content could be made worth it.

[h1]Conclusions: decent but not enough content[/h1]

Consider the length: less than 15 minutes. By all means, the levels are nice and puzzle design adequate for the bunch, but it's so short.

There's nothing else compelling about it. I mean, it's virtually bug-free (good) and the soft colorful choices of palette are cute (nice) and its music is okay but forgettable (oh well), but nothing is making me say ""woah"" for its 15 minutes of stage time.

Yet, if you get this for about ‚Ç¨0.50 or less and want a short achievement/puzzle fix, it may still be worth it.

If it were free, it would definitely be a recommendation. Incidentally, you can play it [url=https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/712242]free on Newgrounds[/url]. So maybe go there first and come back if you want to support the dev and/or get the Steam achievements.

[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9997062/]~Twistorian Curator~[/url] For this game I found it hard to decide if i should recommend or not. The game itself is a basic idea and it would be a good game to play, to kill sometime. The music is average. If you like steam achievements then this is the game for you. The price for this game I find way too expensive. You can find games similar to this far cheaper.

1357830,Arcana: Heat and Cold. Season 1,game,False,"6 Oct, 2020","Adventure, Casual",The misfortunes of the unskilled magician who just wanted to make some money and not get into any troubles.,"Wilx100% (Aug 23, 2022) - VERY nice game. The gameplay is just a visual novel but with a tinyyyy bit of puzzles in it, but the story is interesting and fun, and each character is unique. The art is beautiful, It goes from pixel art to full 2D when any dialogue happens and when the ""romance"" scenes happen. It's honestly a very well-drawn and story-rich game. I would rate this game 8/10. The game has a good style and a funny plot 10/10 Annoying interface with drag'n'drop without much reason for it to be there, nor any particular depth to the feature. Also, long and annoying expositional talking from NPCs. 
The graphics are OK though. Boring

STEAM is garbage, tries to control what we post. Story: You are a skilled man in the arts of the Arcana (magic) and you live a simple, yet chaotic, nomadic life traveling around aided people. There is a system that affects everyone, balancing hot and cold natures (kind of like Chakras) or the person will become sick. You come across different situations involving a few individuals that need your help. A couple of them are hot, beauties that eventually accompany you along the way and repay you for your help. There is a ton of conversations, friendly banter, and clowning around between the characters on the journey.

Content: MaleXFemale, FemaleXFemale, Female Creatures (a fox and a spider for example)
There are 8 scenes which are somewhat long sequences with still images and voice acting.

Audio/Visuals: The quality of the art is excellent and the game world is a nice, unique RPG of the past (think older Final Fantasy, Octopath Traveler, and RPG Maker games). The sounds and voices are fitting with the context of the game.

Bugs: None encountered.

Length: 3-5 hours, mainly depends on how fast you read and how long you ""spend"" in the scenes.

Overall, a great, short game with well drawn art for a small price. I wish Season 1 and 2 were one game, but I guess some people like to break things up like this for reasons unknown to me. I would recommend it at its current price and state. more of a reading simulator than an rpg, but the story is fine, worth $5 at least Good plot line,puzzles are bit annoying and music gets repetitive after a while.More like a visual novel then a game. a game which if you win, you actually lose

Choose from 20 of the baddest ballers around, each with unique special attacks and abilities, and do battle on a variety of hazard-filled courts.","The other positive reviews (which convinced me to buy this game in the first place) already said it better than I can. If you've ever been a fan of the 'EA Sports BIG' games then this one should be an automatic wishlist at the very least. slam dunk this in the refund basket, dawg Yes, I would like to recommend Dunk Lords for everybody. +1 üèÄ First are the positives: I love the soundtrack to this game. Immediately you are launched into a wonderful bouncy title screen, and the art is equally beautiful. The aesthetic to the game is fantastic and perfect for the type of game it wants to be. That said....

It's way too busy on such a small court. You're immediately inundated with a wide moveset (which is great! but) you have such a small court to maneuver it around on, and events on the court happen so fast that you need to be intimately familiar with the game before you can even think of utilising moves like faking a shot. You're expected to uppercut an opponent when they're about to dunk, but it happens in half a second, and when everyone is crowding in the same spot it's impossible to tell what is even happening, let alone know what move to use. I really want to like this game, because it's solid mechanically, but the way it delivers all these mechanics needs work. It's a soft no, but if it's on sale and you want to grind a hundred hours into becoming a Dunk LORD, go for it. 3 POINT BOOTS What is Dunk Lords ?

Well, what a disappointment, Im someone who really like to keep searching for a long time the steam catalog during a sale looking for some underrated indie I never heard about that is cheap and fun and that may provide something I may not get from an AAA game, Dunk Lords taking a fast look into the images and videos on the store page made it look like a simple basketball indie game and with its cartoony and colorful visuals I expected that I would get a fine sport game that would be fun and easy to get into, the sad thing is that this game just feels off, the controls are unresponsive and messy, the gameplay lacks a lot of polish and it feels way faster than it any right to be so every match becomes a confusing mess that is hard to keep focused into, the maps are too small for the chaotic gameplay they present here and as soon everyone get their upgrades and special moves it feels like a very unbalanced clusterfuck where every character can hit the ball multiple times without being able to stopped, even the moves responsible for taking the ball back from an opponent or blocking their launch feels useless and unresponsive, it all comes to the a rush to who can ""dunk"" faster so it feels like a half-assed indie basketball game, I didnt expect it to be a topnotch mario-like sports game with colorful visuals, powers or silly stuff happening like many other similar games does, it actually even does have that but doesnt put it into any good use, I just expected it to be fun and the game isnt, it just feels poorly designed, unbalanced, and messy, so I cant recommend it at all. Come for the NBA Jam / NFL Blitz warm nostalgia vibes, stay for the depth of strategy, achievements, and game modes. Really fun game! It's essentially NBA Jam with a Moba-style item system, characters with special powers, and the ability to beat the crap out of each other.

I had a lot of fun playing this game, but the lack of an online multiplayer mode is honestly quite a waste, especially considering the global situation. frank is a sentient strawberry whos the second coming of steven curry",0.016872727272727286
494780,MageWorks,game,False,"28 Mar, 2019",Casual,"Get ready to embark on an epic journey into the mystical world of MageWorks! Armed with your trusty spellbook and powerful staff, you'll conquer every magical obstacle in your path. Are you ready for the adventure of a lifetime?","Just finished (hopefully) the tutorial. As soon as you start, you're greeted by a big scroll with a wavy dragon head. It speaks to you for at least a full five minutes, where you aren't allowed to do ANYTHING besides stand and listen. This is continued further when you're told how to play by the bird familiar, with each individual step of doing one small thing being surrounded by about 5-10 minutes of talking and awkward, uncared for jokes. During this tutorial phase, there is NO free-roam, object interaction, or anything besides the tutorial. I spent the first full hour of gameplay listening to that bird talk, and lost all appetite for the game. I may try it again in the future, but for now the controls are terrible and the tutorial completely ruins the game. Okay so I just bought this game and when I start the game it crashes every times I restarted it I shut it down I uninstalled it and still it crashes So I'm giving it a thumbs up, because I don't think it's fair to downvote a game that is open about its issues from the get go.  Pretty much I knew what to expect when I bought it.

Overall in it's current state as of this review (8/5/2016) it's a neat little tech demo.  The spells load quickly and are kind of fun to play with.  

The graphics need some work.  Textures in specific. It's got a very colorful, cartoony, almost Fable look to it, but the textures are some of the lowest I've seen in VR so far.

I wouldn't mind an alternate navigation system to the teleport since I don't get the motion sickness issue, but I realize that I'm probably in the minority of players who can wrap their brain and stomach around moving without actually moving.

If I could throw the developer some suggestions it would be:

* In addition to the custom spellbook, it would be nice to have a carry slot to hold more than one spell book.  A belt slot for example like you can find in many other VR games.

* In your more aggressive monster levels, work on the AI a bit.  I never once felt threatened or at risk of being killed by the orcs that were in the village. 

* Tighten up the environment textures a bit.  They are pretty grainy.

Overall: This game was worth my $5 entry fee and I look forward to what the developer has coming next. 
 Currently lacking in content but certainly an enjoyable game.
Pretty casual as said in the description.
You teleport around your tower where you can choose different staffs a choose and elemental book for your spells
Each elemental book has a couple different spells, but most are locked.
There are 3 different spells you can choose from but you also find 2 more by traveling to different locations.
The third location I couldn't find a spell, but the mobs were more aggressive and numbered.

I am sure you will also be able to draw your own staff, but haven't figured out how to do that.

Also lacking tutorials, but that will probably be fixed in the future.
The current small tutorial is in form of a book, so it is easy to add more.


Seems like it could be a pleasant relaxed game in the future.
 I found the lack of instructions frustrating when I first played this game a few days back. But the new version released yesterday is a great improvement. I'm happy I contributed money to this game as the developer is clearly making progress. I look forward to seeing where it goes. This is still too rough for me, so I can't recommend it.

The concept is nice, and the ideas presented by the developer sound fun
but until it gets more fleshed out I don't see myself playing this any more.

It's also riddled with bugs and glitches.
Highlighted items staying highlighted forever, the pages of my book were
stuck far outside of the bindings for a while, switching books didn't work half the time
and the teleporting is very fiddly.
I'm also floating 2ft off the ground, which could probably be solved by a room calibration, but is
definetly a problem with the game itself since my floor is perfectly level in the SteamVR hub as
well as my other VR games.

I also disliked the mana mechanic since 99% of the fun is to just mess around with the spells.

Given more time and work this can turn into a decent little game,
and I'd be happy to come back to it if it does - but for now, it's a no. Ok, I visited the three locations now. I think it¬¥s a nice concept and it makes fun so far. You can¬¥t expect too much, but the dev is honest and wrote a good description what he is planing here on the store page. 
Actual status: ""Early Access will allow players to hop into the MageWorks world in its current form as a magic playground to casually test spells and explore environments.‚Äù 
If he is honest with one year of development until leaving the Early Access status and if he is using this time good it could get a really great game I think. I liked it more than A Legend of Luca because the environment is really nice and it has some hard to describe fun factor for me. 
But again, it¬¥s Early Access, you can¬¥t even fight atm with the enemies. The enemies direct outside of the castle are only targets for testing spells. The others in the first place also, in the second place they notice you but are shooting in a different direction and in the third one they come and beat you but they are not making damage. But the fight system is really nice and the spells are cool and well made. Made a lot of fun and I¬¥m really looking forward to play the finished game.

Pro 
-nice environment 
-nice spells and good targeting 
-cool concept 
-it¬¥s hard to descripe, I liked the way it is :-)

Contra 
-short and not much content atm 

Possible bugs 
-had some stuttering, but Steam VR was making problems half of the day, so maybe no problem for you 
-I fallen two times in the floor while teleporting back to castle

I will keep it and hope that the dev is nobody that is making cash and then doesn¬¥t deliver more content. If you want to play a game NOW don¬¥t buy it. If you want to support the dev and giving him the possibility to hopefully put more time on it you can give it a try if you ask me. Good starting foundation.  Enough fun with the spells and limited exploration to warrant the 4.99 buy in and support development price.

In my limited playtime so far, I'm a bit put off by the cartoony alien looking monsters. The rest of the game has such a good basic feel I'm not sure why you went with that - I'd much rather see a variety of traditional advasaries.

Combat has quite a bit of room to improve, everything is one shot dead - extremely basic combat mechanics.

If you are going to include the basic hunter/gatherer premise that would add some value, not sure what I'm supposed to be looking for beyond spells?

Overall in July this is a game that I feel is good fun at this price.  By December it will need to be expanded on greatly or like many other of these recent early releases I fear it could be lost in the sea of developed upcoming games.",0.12829481386858438

Some problems: The armrest for the captain covers the speedbrake lever i believe so you cant really use that. One time I logged into the plane and the screen that displays attitude, altitiude, ect was black. To fix it, you hover over it qith your mouse and either scroll up and down and it will get brighter. This has happened to me several times, where you log in and the heading map isnt working( it says in a red text). To fix it, i delete the add on from my computer and then i reinstall it and its fine. Overall a great add on and would recommend purchasing. Terrible!!! Don't waste your time and money. A good bit of the cockpit modes don't work and screens go blank. I can't believe i wasted my money on this crap This really is a shocking add-on and wish I could be refunded for this to put towards a better one.

This is an [b]amazing[/b] lolige, but you should buy „ÇÇ„ÅÆ„Åπ„ÅÆ ÂÖ®ÈÉ®ÂÖ•„Çä (Monobeno Complete Collection) on DLsite instead of getting it on Steam.
It's crazy expensive at full price (over $90), but it regularly goes on sale for dirt cheap (less than $5), and the amount of content you get with it is insane (Plus tons of H-scenes you'll never find on Steam)

Unfortunately, there is no English translation (official or otherwise), and it's highly unlikely one will ever exist, but that's not exactly a necessity for the H-scenes, and you could always leave it on as background noise in any case, I suppose (The music is really really good)

So in conclusion, get this on DLsite when it's on sale (which happens frequently) even if it's just for the H-scenes.

[h1]ADDITIONAL NOTE[/h1]
Tooru and his little sister, Natsuha, returned to the remote village of Monobeno. Just as they were getting used to living in Monobeno, it was time for the Shichi Seisai summer festival, dedicated to the local deity Himemiya. This was a story about humans and monsters, disease and haunting, and the past and the future.

The game has many different story route, you can choose some story as your wish. some of storyline will give impression according theme. so far, I wasn't found any bad ending occurs. the storyline is very long, might it take the times a lot.

You can customize their faces with your own style, the game has a feature to change the face. The features is for fun purpose only and you can save the image that you've already edited.

No achievements available, will be easier to savor every moments. There is Japanese audio only available. No English subtitles, although Japanese language is fair enough to read. somehow I wanna Indonesian language as it should be.

Only one thing may not satisfy all the gal-game players, the development of the plot is relatively slow, additionally those who want 18-R contents need to download the patch themselves. 
Well, I don't think the slow development is that bad, ^ ^More than the beginning of Monobeno meanders is not mysterious or intense, but intriguing.

I was driving it and having fun and then the music started and blue smoke started appearing and then... POOF!! Absolutely love this DLC and can totally appreciate the work put into it because I am a HUGE Back To The Future fan!!! Anybody who is a fan of Back To The Future would totally love this DLC!! And i have to give props to the game devs, well done Red Dot Games. Hopefully Car Mechanic Simulator 2018 on Xbox One will have this kind of love and care in it. I would like to ask, why are there headlights for the two different versions of the DeLorean? The design for the headlighst are the same on the cars. i cant load back in now ive got this car

The main role in the operation was assigned to the 16 and 92ArmBde units. Also, IRGC and militia units were brought to participate in the operation.","hands down the best DLC, Like always GTTs engine just flows like water with a modern combat setting. Not a lot of baby sitting necessary and you actually spend a good amount of time trying to hide your troops do to the landscape being a tankers wet dream, its flat and open and the gunners sights can see for MILES. Game has the typical pin point surgical AI arty and yes the 2 sand berms that you have to hide your infantry behind are zeroed in on and yes the boys in those apcs and ifvs take off running as soon as a shell lands near by. i recommend just pulling the infantry all the way back and letting the armor crack that Iranian walnut. Chieftains are peak The devs picked a very rare military theme for the game.
Pay respect to you guys for that!

P.S. for anyone interested in the ""Iran - Iraq war"" I recommend to read a great book ""The Iran-Iraq War"" by Pierre Razoux. Please create more modern warfare content like this. hasn't worked for me since i bought this dlc. crashes during the battle load screen, reported the crash, they fix it and put the fix in beta. They have yet to release the fix.

Bought it in November 2022, and Feb 21 2023 the fix has STILL not been released. And have still not been able to play this operation/DLC who will win?
an entire Chieftain Battalion vs some Iraqi guys with funni joystick missiles This is not a hard no, but atm I currently wouldn't recommend it on it's own or for the full price. There's just not a lot you're getting with this dlc currently: the map is quite small, there doesn't seem to be any Iraqi Republican Guard units, and both sides don't have the ability to call in fighter support from the air (at least in custom battles) which is odd considering Iran had a noteworthy air-force during the war. So on its own in it's current state, I would say wait until either they release another Iran-Iraq war dlc, or update this one to be worth $16~ hope you guys are ok. slava Ukraini ! Amazing, when the tanks are clashing and the jets are flying overhead dropping ordinance is just awesome to watch. Well, of course I picked this up.  But I had to wait until it was no longer on sale, in order to do the developer justice.

784160,NASCAR Heat 2 - 2018 Season Update,dlc,False,"9 Feb, 2018",Racing,"The Roval has arrived. Race on this one-of-a-kind track before anyone else. 2018 paint schemes, an updated driver roster and race schedule, and new drivers are also included for the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. Finally, compete in the all-new 2018 Chevrolet Camaro in the 2018 Season Update.","Honestly, this is a pretty sour note to end the game's support on; I would've preferred it be delayed rather than released in its current state. A whole lot of seemingly tiny technical issues pile up into just a frustrating, incomplete release that feels like too many corners were cut. In turn, you're paying $10 for a single track layout and 40 Cup cars, 1/3 of which are on a new car model.

You're also starting a new save file (and waiting through a hefty load time as it reloads all the assets from scratch once you click 2018) for the privilege of ever looking at these. Unlike Heat Evolution, the two playable years are kept completely separate, and you'll have to reselect your icon, start your speed rating from scratch, and even reconfigure your controls to begin using the 2018 expansion. After all that, you'll be able to play single-player or local quick races, championships, and career; as with Heat Evo, no missions, and no online multiplayer. As you can't use the Charlotte Roval with the 2017 season, it is completely inaccessible for online, as is the 2018 Camaro.

If you're playing the Truck Series or Xfinity Series, absolutely nothing is different. That's not an exaggeration; they're unaltered from the 2017 portion of the game.

If you're playing the Cup Series, you've got a new roster, and it's an interesting mishmash of Cup drivers and drivers from other series. Personally, I'm a sucker for that kind of thing; Hailie Deegan's Cup car here looks frickin' awesome and became my top choice, even with DiBenedetto being one button away. You've also got, of course, the Charlotte Roval added to the track list. Rather than being an alternate event to Charlotte, EA-style, it's listed as a completely separate track.

It was actually finally playing the Roval that made all the frustration not at all worth it. The AI puttered around somewhat cluelessly, the pre-race camera literally just had its animations from main Charlotte copied over (I expected at least one pan over anywhere in the infield, but the angles all focus on the oval and the actual circuit is barely seen), and after I clumsily flung my car through the tight, narrow circuit, slamming haphazardly into walls along the way, I was instantly rewarded with a perfect 105 speed rating I didn't at all earn and, in victory lane, the trophy for the 2017 Coca-Cola 600, which was not the event I was at or the entire year I was taking part.

If you're going for full NASCAR collection completionism, it's important to have this particular layout because, as it was changed just after this DLC was publically revealed, this layout is not actually what will be used at the 2018 Bank of America 400. The last two tight, twisty turns in the infield before you're released back onto the infield were removed in later drafts, but are present here. They're tough, so you might consider this a plus, but if you want accuracy, that's not what you're getting.

As with Heat Evolution's 2017 season expansion, driver photos are replaced with their numbers, but now on loading screens as well.

This really feels like the art department and track modelers did a good job and then absolutely everything gameplay-wise just fell right the hell apart. It's a nearly identical copy of the base game that bafflingly forces you to start from scratch, and the only things it adds aren't accurate enough to be a must-have for fans, crazy enough to be a must-have for novelty value, or really particularly complete.

(As the expansion didn't initially actually do anything on launch day on PC, I do wonder if consoles have a more complete version and this was more hastily ported. I doubt it, though.)

After two years in a row of extraneous bizarre half-measure expansions being slapped together for the start of the season, my patience is running thin. I can do better. You can do better. 704 Games can do better. You don't need this. I would really like to see what the DLC is going to look like. But I can't right now becuase it won't instal. The gtame still works, but the DLC won't instal. This is the worst DLC i ever brought. Cant use it.  If this gets fixed than i will update this review.  Just hold off buying this DLC.  As for now i will not recommend this DLC. Wish we could download it.... Pay'd for it but it will not install.

Update 6:20PM EST It downloaded :) After some panic as the game didnt want to download, when it did downloand it is well worth the money. The 2018 schedule for the Monster Energy series and the Camaro car. Only small grip I have iis that I cant havea  quick race on the Charlotte Roval. but otherwise its a worthwile update. Don't understand why I can't install it! People on xbox and playstation are already playing this but I have paid for this and wanna play it now but it wont download yet My biggest problem is that I can't install the DLC for some reason. Aside from that, I'm excited to drive in the 2018 paint schemes and schedule. I'm just hoping the Charlotte Roval layout gets corrected, and the ISM Raceway layout also gets corrected with its new location for the Start/Finish Line.",0.08632310261523743

10/10 app dev is very schizo but I love them

this app is incredibly scuffed, but worry not, that is a filter for the casuals

you may see reviews of people saying ""ooo waaaa i can't figure it out"" those people have the technological literacy of an 80 year old cambodian rice farmer.

the tutorials that come with the game, in fact, do not work... and I hope they never do :) More of a rant review but this app bothered me in so many ways. 

Even with the ""tutorial"", the program has a weird way instructing on how to use the app. Not intuitive without searching further in community tab or youtube which i eventually figured out how to use it. Sus or weird prompts. UI design is TERRIBLE. File locations and save directories are TERRIBLE. While I'm sure the app is safe, having to enter my steam credentials again into a text field is just weird. 

The worst thing I disliked is how to use workshop items. Never figured out how find them if you utilized the steam workshop page then searched the AnimaEngine folder workshop folder with it empty even after they downloaded and restarted app. 

You'll make the app more useful and fun if the UI especially was overhauled/refined. Take Wallpaper Engine as an example. [h1] Decent, But Needs Improvement [/h1]  

The Software is good, but it‚Äôs got some rough edges. The workshop loads [i]slowly as hell[/i] (in-app), and launching it takes around 5-7 minutes, which is honestly painful for me.

That said, there are some solid positives. The AI background remover works flawlessly, the tutorial is detailed, and most importantly‚ÄîI can have my lovely Carlotta Montelli dancing on my desktop.

325160,Bik - A Space Adventure,game,False,"14 Oct, 2014","Adventure, Indie","A point and click adventure. Bik and his newfound alien friends outsmart hijackers, (eat some brownies), accept a perilous mission, (make some sandwiches), foil a dastardly plot by an evil corporate empire, (argue with disgruntled robots), and save a planet on the brink of destruction.","I first played this game almost a decade ago, and I loved it. After thinking about it recently I decided to get it again, and it still sorta holds up to how I remember it. Since I've played this twice before, I do remember the solutions to most of the puzzles, so they're not as hard as I remembered them to be, but some of them can slow the game down. My biggest complaint is that the sounds effects that play can be pretty annoying at times.

Back in 2014/2015 when I first played and beat this game, I contacted the developers asking if they had any plans for a sequel, but sadly they didn't. If a Dev sees this, know that I would still LOVE to see a sequel to this game, or at least a spin-off set in the same universe. Wonderful game. The writing has a lot of charm. Fantastic soundtrack (I actually bought it separately). Overall very recommended!! [b]Imagine being a little boy going on a camping trip with your friends, 
but suddenly you wake up on a spaceship
and together with two aliens and your Gametron you are going to save the galaxy.[/b]

This adventure was so funny and charming. 
It has really great writing, (oldschool-)graphics and music. 
The puzzles are not too hard and there is a walkthrough guide in case you get stuck.
It can be played with a controller, but mouse-input is much more comfortable.
You should definetly give this game a try if you are a fan of the old Lucasarts adventures. Fun and cute humor that tickled me. The interesting, intertwining stories have nice pacing, and the puzzles have a decent difficulty level. Graphics had a couple nice surprise effects. Music and sound was passible. The game uses 285Mbs of diskspace and uses the Unity game engine. I played this game on an old Ubuntu desktop with the keyboard and mouse. I saw no technical issues. I try to avoid ""delightful"" as it seems like an adjective used by people on the receiving end of pity sex.  Bik is truly a delight however, and well worth your time.

Bik tells the story of the titular young scamp, abducted by a belligerent race that comes in second on the list of the galaxy's vilest gangs.  You're soon rescued by some kind-heated mercenaries whose loose tactical coordination and moral compunctions end with a galaxy-saving adventure.

Bik is simple, fun, well-written and full of surprises.  I almost never consulted a guide and the game presents an amusing variety of challenges.  Bold pastel colors give the pixel graphics a real zest.  The great strength of Bik is its likable characters.  It is perhaps the most anti-Hatred title on Steam, providing lovable characters doing the right thing for their friends.  There is absolutely a place for more cynical storytelling but seeing two scrappy underdogs become friends and save the galaxy is occasionally what we all need, especially when it involves achievements for eating baloney sandwiches.

Pick it up.  You won't be disappointed. A really good point-and-click! It seems criminally underrated, and that's a shame. It's a lovely hidden gem. 

The game's got great writing, story, and characters. There's a lot of good humor, adventure, and even drama (and sandwiches). I really like the worldbuilding this game establishes. Space is an interesting and colorful place with lots of things to discover and genuinely likable characters to meet. I had a lot of fun just clicking on different things and trying items in different combinations just to see what would happen. There's also a bunch of neat little references to classic sci-fi here and there without it being distracting. What I really found fascinating  is that you can use the ""examine"" button on the character you control, giving you some insight into their mental state; you learn something new about them whichever area you're in. It was an interesting mechanic that gave whichever character you control a little bit more depth. 

The graphics and soundtrack are simple, yet charming. It's got a great nostalgic/retro look going on that didn't strike me as lazy or cheap. The puzzles are logical, creative, and challenging without being overly frustrating. The non-story achievements are really silly and fun to get too (there's a lot of different hilarious ways to die). 

The game's length is relatively short, but it's a good length for the story the game is trying to tell. It doesn't feel rushed and it doesn't overstay its welcome. The price is fair for what the game has to offer. The only real downside is that there's a neat little sequel hook at the end of the game and there doesn't seem to be a sequel in sight. I would've loved to revisit this world again a little bit more. 

Recommended if you like sci-fi, point-and-clicks, solid writing, and fun. It's a delightful game that could use some more recognition. Tags: Adventure - P&C - Point&Click

TLDR: Homage to early adventure games. Too faithful to the source with cryptic hard puzzles, walkthrough required. Long and drawn out story without a solid early plot hook. Pixelated and ugly. What a great game! It reminds me of the Sierra games I played as a child and it has a nice soundtrack too. There is nothing really new or groundbreaking here but simple fun like in the older days of gaming. I highly recommend playing this! A wonderful game. 10/10, easy! A fun little game in the tradition of classic comedic adventure games such as Space Quest and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, although thankfully less difficult.

2290760,Neighbors,game,False,"1 Feb, 2025","Adventure, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",A folk noir detective horror game. An old time detective trying to find out the truth behind a missing girl in a mysterious place.,"With the nice creepy visuals and atmospheric sound, I was excited for this one. Unfortunately it's not currently playable for me.

The game is text only (even though the store page lists English audio), but the text is barely readable and doesn't look at all like the screenshots. It's translucent and appears to be overly pixelated and then scaled up into blurry shapes. There are no resolution or graphic options, so you're just stuck trying to decipher what is even happening.

Once you select a dialogue option, the selection pops back up to the first question so that you have to scroll down from the top for every single response. This is a small issue but got tedious very quickly.

When talking to the first character, I accidentally hit the left/right buttons, and the game switched back to the walking view. The player character's walk animation no longer played when moving, but instead his static image would glide along the screen. I tried to start a new game, but this time the conversation displayed options for things I hadn't yet asked, as well as blank lines between a few dialogue options.

I encountered the same issue on two separate computers, that have no problems running things like Until Dawn, so I don't think it's a resource issue. I hope this can get resolved, but I can't recommend the game in it's current state. The game is fairly interestin' from the get go. The story revolves around us as a detective tryin' to figure the truth behind a missing woman in an odd hotel. I like the stylized graphics here. I do, however, think the game could do with more sound effects, ambient music, voice over work, use of mouse etc. Even talkin' to the NPCs is not fluid since the cursors disappears most of the time when selecting a dialogue choice. As a result, you would have to escape the conversation then reengage. It gets rather annoyin'. Also the price point is a bit steep. It's askin' for too much at 18 bucks. Should be around 12 bucks max imo. With all that bein said, I am intrigued enough to continue the mystery. I'll give it a thumb up due to the premise. May wanna wait for sale otherwise.

A very fun and quirky lil game series about rebellion in a small sci fi setting. I enjoyed a lot of the background worldbuilding and the characters are very charming. Gameplay consist of straight forward fetch quest puzzles which is okay considering this is an RPGmaker game that costs very little. okey The conclusion of the 4 part-2016 story and it got pretty good at the end. Simple point-and-click adventure! awful You can check my review of the first episode for a more general review. Overall the Space Pilgrim saga is a pretty well done RPG (people debate that it's moreso a point and click than RPG since there's no combat) with some clever writing and endearing characters. I found there were some minor gripes with the pacing of the 3rd episode, but this final stretch of the Pilgrim Saga was worth the investment of the three previous installments. There's actually some choices to be made here that can affect the story, and multiple of the storylines wrap themselves up in a pretty satisfying conclusion. I thought the characterization of all the characters were pretty well done, nothing groundbreaking or extremely original in itself, but all of the elements come together for a charming little space adventure. The game I'd say will on average take ~10 hours to complete (episodes 1-4).

I think script is not good because somtimes character doing things without logic
but it`s not a big deal

531080,Minotaur's Maze,game,False,"12 Apr, 2017","Indie, RPG, Early Access",Minotaur's Maze is a tactical tabletop dungeon crawler brought to life in VR.,"LONG VERSION - So originally bought this game long ago, but couldn't get it to work with my Touch controllers on my Oculus Rift, despite the page showing that it supports Oculus.  The developer confirmed that he didn't know why his page showed this support (he'd never tested it) and didn't mean for his page to show it and said he couldn't remove it.   Could never get it to work, the game stopped being supported later and it disappeared into my list of VR games to be forgotten.   Until I got my Rift S.

Something told me to boot this back up and try to see if the Rift S controllers were any better with it.  You wouldn't figure it would be, but I got curious.  Turns out it worked much better, although clunky for some reason.  I found out on an old youtube comment that the controllers detect touch on the buttons in addition to pressing them, which complicates things.  So if you went into the Steam controller settings for this specific game (Steam VR options, Devices, Controller Settings, then pick the game from the list on the right) and DISABLED the touch feature on the A, B, X and Y buttons (I also did this for the triggers as well, just to be safe), then the game works!

It's a fun game, easy to learn, has some humor in it. and the ability to move around and change distance from the map in 3rd person gives it a cool atmosphere, almost like you're the character and the DM.  If you like D&D type dungeon crawlers I'd recommend it for the $10 if you have a Rift S or a Vive.   

TLDR (short) version - You can get this working with the controllers on Rift S with some minor adjustments in the settings and it's a fun dungeon crawler for ten bucks. No updates for over a year While I am not necessarily a fan of the rougelike, this has just enough of a Diablo feel to keep it interesting. Feels like a real time miniatures RPG game in VR. Pretty fun so far, easy to pickup and play. I picked this up because I just like the idea of ""tabletop perspective"" in VR games and I am impressed.

Minotaur's Maze does a lot of really cool things I would love to see in more VR games. The UI is fairly minimalistic but feels really good, and the VR controls are tight. The art assets themselves aren't going to amaze anyone in 2017, but they did a great job making everything coherent. With some solid lighting they give the game a pleasing aesthetic that is easy on the eyes in VR and just looks cool to be in. There is a VR tutorial built into the game which is also a big plus. Not related to VR, but I also appreciated the campy-yet-adorable voice acting.

That being said, the gameplay isn't likely to blow you out of the water, but I think the package as a whole is fun. There were a few annoyances - sometimes the menu spawns inside a wall and gets cut-off, and the in-game controls help shows the gamepad controls even if you are using the Vive controllers. It also took a while to figure out how to move the playspace which I don't think was mentioned in the tutorial. All in all, it's a solid take on a tabletop perspective game.  highly recommend this game. I have only played it for about 30 minutes so far, but I was completely enthralled.

The game is set at a 3/4 angle viewpoint and is a point and click diablo-style dungeon crawler game. Being in VR the left hand moves the screen around and has some light zoom in/out. You need to use the left hand as a candle to light your way as well which was neat. I actually sat down at one point to get a closer view. The way the graphics are everything looks like little toys. I actually felt like there were little action figures in front of me animating and fighting. It's a fairly simple game but I can see a lot of cool things being done. Early access so you know there's more to come. For $10 I highly enjoyed this experience so far
 Borderline 'Yes' recomendation ... The gameplay is unique for VR at the moment (similar in feel to Legend of Luca but tries to be more strategic) but a couple little irks bring it down

Starting as a Rogue you will enter the dungeon and immediately get overwhelmed and killed ... really?  

Trying to use your inventory via the floating hud or the controller will often result in moving your character...often to your death.

Those two things really diminish the game at the moment, fixing these will go a long way",0.08143909944930348

ÊàäÂØÖÂπ¥Áßã‰∫é‰π¶Êàø This is a fun little RPG maker title, with some actually decent storylines. Comparisons have been made to this being a tiny 2D version of the Witcher, which is true insofar you are a mercenary hunting down mysteries and dangerous monsters. The script was a bit better than the standard RPG maker fare, I even found myself laughing a few times and feeling very moved by the conclusion of the story. I found some spelling errors and the game's real-time combat hit detection to be slightly wonky, but never enough to affect my enjoyment. If you're on the fence and want a fun little RPG with interesting sidequests I'd grab this one, especially on sale!

Good game
Thorne - Death Merchants  6/10
Heisen <3 ‚†Ä Nice game, definitely a bit short, but i know how much work making even a short game like this requires. You can feel it's a labor of love. World is full of events and great to explore. Nice implement of MA Quest Journal. Maybe a little bit too much ""default"" RPGMaker stuff left in for my taste (like that annoying walking sound effect which doesn't sound like walking at all). But every part that was different than usual, like combat system or map of the area was a nice addition. [h3] Combat [/h3]
-------------------

Thorne - Death Merchants is a fun little RPGMaker game buried under bad combat. It is difficult, but not in a git gud kind of way. Combat just feels unrewarding. Enemies swarm you from all sides. They respawn when you return to an area, or sometimes just infinitely spawn in certain locations.

You can die pretty quickly, from bleeding damage, poison, or being molotov'd to death from a good distance away. A possible glitch(?) means even after using antidote or a tourniquet you can still lose HP to poison/bleeding damage. All this stuff isn't fun and detracts from the game. If you like a challenge, there are better games out there that will really test your mettle and reward your efforts. Thorne - Death Merchants isn't one of them.

If you want to find where your saves live so you edit them: [spoiler] you can search 'Thorne' and you'll find where the are, as they're not in the immediate local file where the game is installed. The rvdata2 files are your saves. There's also a backup Thorne folder so just check you're in the right one.

On Steam Deck the path for me was:
/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/451920/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Application Data/Thorne/Death Merchants/ [/spoiler]

But once you balance the combat, you'll have a decent time here. Some people will balk at this, but occasionally a bad game needs a little stat boosting from... external sources. Google is your friend and RPGMaker save editors exist is all I'll say. Whether you want to or not for a game that often costs $1 is up to you. But my beefed up Mr 'The Crow' demolished everything in his path and I had a great time doing it.

[h3] Controls [/h3]
-------------------

Thorne runs... ok? on Steam Deck via Proton. The game looks fine on the Steam Deck and isn't super squished out like it can be in full screen on regular desktop. The controls are a bit weird, controller will work but a mouse cursor will hang around. You can move it out the way with the right joystick, but the menu mainly uses mouse controls instead of controller. It made saving and loading a bit annoying but nothing unmanageable.

The Steam Deck's right track pad tends to click automatically in the main menu instead of scrolling properly too. This hasn't happened with any other games I've played on my Steam Deck recently or in the past, so I'm putting this issue down to weird Thorne tomfoolery.

If you want to mainly use a controller you may want to remap the healing and rage actions to a specific button. This is pretty easy to do on Steam Deck, but on regular pc press F1 to view and change controls. At one point I mapped the molotov attack to left trigger, but Thorne would only face right when attacking. It made the [spoiler] Goblin Cave [/spoiler] annoying because you have to [spoiler] destroy the circle spawn points by facing them directly then molotoving. [/spoiler] Remapping the button to X fixed this weird quirk and I'm not sure why.

[h3] Story [/h3]
-------------------

The game starts by asking if you want to play in English or Portuguese, I played in English. From this, I'm assuming English may not be the dev's first language and it does show. There are grammatical errors, typos and weird syntax abound. It isn't so bad that you have to sit there deciphering what the heck a sentence even means, but if you're precious about perfect grammar it will annoy you.

Once you beef up your merc the unofficial way, exploration becomes enjoyable because you're not getting ambushed constantly. Have a look around and see what you can find. If you get lost, there is an in game map item that I got from a chest near some bandits somewhere off to the right (or check the screenshots page here, I've added one of the map.)

The story in this game is actually decent, if short. A village needs your help and you're the mercenary in need of coin, give or take some other stuff in between of course. If you stray from the beaten path there are side quests here and there. Don't go to the McArthur Estate straight away, have a look around first. Maybe check the helpful achievements guides if you really don't want to miss anything. Check the cute little Encyclopedia in the menu to see a sentence or two on enemies or NPCs.

If you're stuck in the Estate section [spoiler]   interact with the angel statues and the gargoyle. Pick up wiggling items in the rooms and pull a curtain lever thing. After you've found some gems and put them in the marble statues, you'll need 3 key fragments to open the mansion doors to get to McArthur. I think you'll find them in the garden, the curtain lever and a bookcase lever from the room that opens up from the marble statue. [/spoiler]

When I finished the game (killing everything in my wake and somewhat rushing) it took me about 2.5 hours and I ended up missing half the achievements. I'd guess it would take maybe 3-6 hours depending on how thorough you are and whether or not you fudge your stats.

[h3] Final Thoughts [/h3]
-------------------

This might seem like a lot of effort for a random RPGMaker game, but there's something to this one. It feels like a 2D proto baby discount Witcher almost, it just needs balancing to get there. If you can be bothered to do that, give it a shot.

If you like the RPGMaker style, check out these games with some of the aspects I liked from Thorne:

Ara Fell - turn based RPG with good exploration.

The Deed series - dark storytelling where you need to execute the perfect murder.

2243670,Return to Grace,game,False,"30 May, 2023",Adventure,A daring space archaeologist has just unearthed the ancient resting place of a long lost A.I. god known as Grace. Adventure with various fractured A.I. personalities as you uncover the great mystery of why she was shut down all those years ago.,"This is a fun little interactive story/walking simulator - there's not much to do except follow along and uncover the mystery and do a few simple puzzles, but the story is interesting and the characters are fun (and there are some nice references and humour in there too). It's pretty short and sweet - maybe a little expensive for what it is so probably best worth getting in a sale, but it's definitely worth it if you like this sort of thing! Fairly simple, easy to play, good graphics and interesting storyline.  Enjoyable. Return to Grace is a captivating and beautifully crafted game that truly stands out in the indie scene. The storytelling is rich and immersive, with a narrative that draws you in from the start and keeps you hooked until the very end. The atmosphere is incredibly well-designed, with detailed environments that make you feel like you're really living in the world of the game. 

The mechanics are smooth and engaging, offering a great balance of challenge and enjoyment. The puzzles are well thought out and never feel frustrating, making each success feel rewarding. The character development is another highlight, with complex personalities that evolve in meaningful ways as the story progresses.

Overall, Return to Grace is an emotional journey that's hard to put down. It‚Äôs clear that a lot of passion and attention to detail went into its creation, and it‚Äôs a must-play for anyone who enjoys narrative-driven experiences. A very solid walking sim. A simple yet compelling story with enjoyable voice acting and visuals. There are choices sprinkled throughout that encourage a second playthrough for completionists. If you're looking for a breezy game you can complete in one night, this ones a good fit. This game looked promising but I had to refund it because the puzzles don't work. I got as far as the first door puzzle. When I enter the "" 9 light square"" in the center of the puzzle nothing happens and I can't progress. 

Would of liked to play more of it. I really liked this game! It's an adventure through several different environments, with a small gallery of constantly-changing narrators. I'd place it more in the ""walking simulator"" genre than the ""puzzle genre"".

Though it purports to be a story about AI on its surface, it's really more of a story about identity, reconciling the parts of ourselves through conflict and disagreement. What would it mean to banish the parts of yourself you don't like? What do you do when others want something from you that you're no longer able to provide to them? Watching the characters wrestle with these situations is part of the fun.

The architecture in the game is wonderfully evocative, with sprawling retro-futuristic art deco environments, imposing towers and caves to explore, giant abandoned hotel lobbies, etc. Highly recommend this for anyone who likes exploring. I got this game forever ago, forgot about it entirely. Saw it in my library and decided to give it a shot and boy! Was I pleasantly surprised! The depth of the narrative, the well played characters, the environmental obstacles - it all came together into a beautiful story that honestly the ending left me a bit breathless. A good story about the rise and fall of humanity's gilded age! 10/10 will play again! It's a very short game, but the story, exploration and aesthetics totally make up for it. If you enjoy short SciFi stories, this will definitely be something for you. It's been so long since I've gotten to enjoy a narrative exploration game like this!   GORGEOUS environments, intriguing story...   It's on the linear side, but there are branching decision moments as you go, if that means anything to you.   You can see from my playtime that it's not long, but almost the whole thing is bespoke and distinct and beautiful to look at, and the acting is excellent.   Why did it take me this long to hear about this?? Great graphics (yet performs well on the deck).

Puzzles aren't too difficult and don't get in the way of the narrative. Another solid, recent entry in the walking sim genre.

Hoping we'll see more content - it's a rich world with a complex future history that could easily be expanded on in additional discoverable narrative-related items or optional events.",0.19159409409409406
1087110,Football School,game,False,"9 Jan, 2020","Indie, Simulation, Strategy","Football School - Take control of a sports club in a small town. Train your team, compete and climb the world ranking. Management game made by the developers of Boxing School.","Not a very deep or interesting game. Just my type of mindless fun when other games get boring. The management is ok, the matches are absolute garbage (lost many a match because I made the winning goal and then during the ""you made a goal"" animation the ball randomly flew into my goal, tying the match, and then losing in OT). The progression is fast and hard mode is a piece of cake. Not much more to say It aint by far that good as the other games of the studio. The hud is filled with buttons but you alway just click on ""next day"" and sometimes you need to adjust sth with the training. And you have immense money problems and just may buy sth when you have 4 times the expenditures, at least no one cares how many credits you take. This game is not simulating a sport it is endles waiting for money and player development which is annoying to do. I would just love to have Steam achievements. Fun game I wish there was a third recommendation option like a ""sort of"" option.

It is fun to build up your team from having a stadium with rocks and tree stumps on it to a pristine condition stadium and winning tournaments to hopefully get to the international stage.

Losing is bad because it means you got to hit the road and play friendlies until the next cup and it will severely impact on your finances. 

It has been said in other reviews that tactics are useless, I'll give an example say you've got a goalkeeper and suddenly they decide to charge at a player at the other end of the pitch to tackle them and your goal is empty and so all the opposition has to do is nudge the ball down the pitch for a goal. 

This game can be great fun, it is just frustrating at times, that's why I said I sort of recommend it. ive purchased this fun game a while ago, but just recently started playing it alot.  Its pretty addicting.  Watch your football team grow or i mean soccer team lol.   Worth playing I paid 1‚Ç¨
You will get a few hours of content :)

It has a unique twist and low difficulty
Fun playthrough

What should be added:
- new transfer system
- more upgradeable infrastructure
- multiple nationalities
- tournaments for national teams (watchable - maybe coachable?) If there was neutral or ""maybe"" option for whether or not I recommend the game, I would have selected it.

What's the I.Q. of a June Bug? Subtract 10 points from that number and you'll have an idea of the types of players you'll be managing/watching. There might be a good game hidden in there somewhere, but I have to honestly say I am unable to find it. It is obvious that you need to create some momentum to get ahead of salary costs, training requirements, etc. but the game gives little to no feedback on how to adress formations.
This coupled with a complete randomness to games, where it just always seems scewed against you this becomes a VERY frustrating experience, where you do not understand why you are losing, OR how to fix it!
The game might pick up after a while, becoming more fun, but I found it to be a lot more frustrating than fun. beli waktu diskon 90% jadi ga terlalu banyak berharap kualitasnya. ternyata lumayan seru. alternatif lebih santai dari FM. Very fun and addicting football simulator. It is quite challenging, but still fun.
Good price, but I would love to see more character customization.

If you like jigsaws and don't mind shelling out some money for them (in the form of DLC) it is a really solid pick for a game and it has some free puzzles so you can test it out if you like it first before buying more.

Works without any issues on Linux with Proton (tested form 8.0-2 on). Enjoyable, fun way to occupie time. List of Cons First:

The game is poorly optimized when it comes to tabbing over to other tasks and tries to appear invisible on the desktop taskbar unless you specifically alt+tab over back to the game
The game also operates controls if you decide to run it while multitasking with alt+tab,
The worst thing this game has done was delete my local save data after it slowly went into my settings while i was in other tabs.

The Pros Now:

Luckily The game has online features such as making an online account with The Puzzle Club and linking your steam account to it, this feature has saved 52 of my puzzles from being absolutely completely destroyed, and as of the time writing this, 12,121 puzzle pieces placed, 347 hints owned and 40 hints used.
all of my puzzles now appear in game as such:

A Few Examples would be:
zero/640 university with completed puzzle badge
zero/455 lake with completed puzzle badge
zero/840 painting with completed puzzle badge

These 3 puzzles for example count as completed and count towards achievements with the badges still appearing on them.

However: any halfway done or partially done puzzles have bounced back to absolute zero with no completion towards them whatsoever. meaning i have to put at least twice the effort in to complete them.

In Conclusion: The games great regardless of what negative reviews say, So i say to the positive reviewers, DO NOT RELY ON LOCAL SAVE DATA. you will regret not making a puzzle club account and backing up your data to more than just local data. If you love Puzzles this a very nice Pack.
 Why can I play graphic intense games like Baldur's Gate 3 with 30-50% pf my GPU being occupied, but as soon as I start this jigsaw game, the GPU shoots up to 100% being used by this application only - and it stayed this way consistently for the 3 hours I played.
I don't think this is the cozy game to play with my Laptop on my lap like I hoped it would be. The GPU usages makes the laptop far too hot for that.",0.12621411483253586

This game does not have Slipknot and fire arms, just a fricked up arm you occasionally stab with a screwdriver.  
Its also not very good. what did i just played? Yeah, the game scares a little but the graphics is so bad even if its 2015 they could do better! [h2]Bleeding Border[/h2]

799840,Life and Debt: A Real Life Simulator,game,False,"28 Feb, 2018","Casual, Simulation, Strategy",Life &amp; Debt: A Real Life Simulator is a 2D pixel art game that challenges players to manage their finances and maintain their cashflow while navigating the challenges of new home ownership. Players must also overcome a shopping addiction and make decisions about how to furnish their home.,"If you want a real life simulator that's not like real life at all, this is the game for you.

Pros:
- Funny achievement names.
- Rent goes up over time, mimicking cost-of-living increases.
- Stock market can be lucrative (get in there early and watch it often!).
- Lotto scratch-off tickets are like in real life -- you're basically wasting your money. (Except they cost WAY more in the game than you'd spend in real life).

Cons:
- You're fired. Constantly. Doesn't matter if job security is high or low, or if you're working a job that requires education... expect to be fired anywhere between 7 and 30 days (more commonly between 14 and 30).
- If you're fired before payday, you get the pay you are owed. However, if you switch jobs before payday, it seems that you don't get the pay owed (or there was no pop-up stating as such, but it seemed to me that my cash didn't go up at all). So if you want to switch jobs but need the upcoming cash from the current job, time it well against paydays, and hope that the classifieds don't change before you switch.
- You can't take on debt to get education. Haven't they heard of student loans?
- The same events happen over and over. How many times can you ""overuse"" and ""break"" your TV, or fall down the stairs while on your phone? Apparently, quite a bit.
- Taxes are brutal, especially when you're busy getting fired a lot.
- The shop is buggy. It sometimes shows that you own things, other times it'll show a count of 0 until you buy it again, only to find out that you wasted your money.
- You can't pause the game. ""You can't pause real life!"" is what it tells you... but since this isn't anything like real life anyway, how about a pause button?
- There's a ""save and exit"" feature, but no autosave (which is a bummer... the game crashed on me in my first 30 minutes of playing so I completely lost that character). There's also no button to simply save without exiting; if you want to save, you're going to the main menu (thankfully it loads quickly).

Too much of the gameplay is unsatisfying, so I don't recommend wasting your time with this game. The game is cute, and it's nice that it gets updates. But it's wildly inaccurate and was clearly made by someone with a negative outlook on life. There are a lot of really random and completely unavoidable debts you incur (like your mom sending you a $10,000 medical debt to pay?!) and it's nearly impossible to hold any job for more than a couple weeks. Additionally, the stock market in this game doesn't perform nearly as well as any realistic market. Overall, this is a game that really makes things seem harder than they are in real life. This game is still buggy even after the recent updates. This game would b great if only they didn't break something  every time they fix something. The updates are far and few between and most of the breaks make it unplayable. So you are left waiting for a fix for half a year. And in the mean time you can't play. As of right now the stock market is broken. Scratch tickets are broken. Financeing items is broken. Don't buy until it becomes playable again. Very poor game.'This Grand Life' is MUCH better. If real life wasn't already enough to keep you in a constant state of anxiety fueled by debt, and never ending life events that come at the most inopportune times, then hold on to your socks cause Life and Debt is here!

It's a fun game, priced about the same as a good cup of coffee and blacker than the soul of the barista who served it to you. The developer did a great job on such a simple game and the updates over time have been good to see. LaD:ARLS is a good time waster and a funny comparison to the struggles of the daily grind. 

If you need to kill a few hours, this game's worth it. It really sucks First of all I would like to thank the developer for fixing the game as I had purchased prior to the latest update.
The game itself is what it says to be. It's a simulation game of ""adulthood"" the goal is to buy every piece of furniture (there are 35 pieces total) and pay down your dept. I love how you gain debt with quirky (yet somewhat believeable) scenarios. Such as, ""Your car has been blasted by a meteor and insurance does not pay for """"acts of space"""""". Also, there are quirky scenarios when you gain money such as: You got ""hurt"" at work and received workers comp. This gives you $10,000 dollars and it may be strange and funny to admit that being hurt on the job was the best thing to happen in this game. One thing however, is about my little bundles of joy (the children) I know this is realistic but, no child that I know has spent $10-20 thousand dollars on credit card purchases a more realistic number would probably be $1,000. Last complaint, When i become a surgeon, I can only keep the job for a payday! I understand you are trying to make the game hard but, Could the job security thing be improved? All in all though, if you are looking for a funny, realistic, light-hearted, challenging game, look no further. Timer/calendar goes forever (at one point it told me it was the 60th of August, and debt doesn't get paid off when I spend my money, but my money gets subtracted. Would be a really cool game if it worked. This game is so much fun to play! The life events keep the game interesting and it is difficult enough to keep you coming back again and again.

Playthrough 7 to 15 min ea.
Got it for 74 cents
 Too short, not enough characterisation or merit given to the romances. Don't really know why the main character is into the love interests or vice versa. Also the art style is overly cutesy and the boobs are just drawn horrible, they look like inflatable sex dolls when they're chests are bared. i think the artwork was great. nice music I have mixed feelings on this product. On one hand, it isn't offensively bad, but it isn't really good.

Firstly, the art is inconsistent, but not terrible. I'd say the sprites are a lot better than the illustrations, but the illustrations aren't too terrible. The music is fine, but it isn't especially memorable. I think the writing is the most disappointing aspect of this. The translation is pretty bad, there's a lot of spelling issues, but overall the writing is just boring. Boring writing doesn't help the already generic story either.

Honestly, if this game was free, I'd not be complaining as much. Get it during a sale. So fucking short..I thought I was in for some good yuri action but smh.Still its playable,not too boring... Super short, but worth the price.  Could've used some more fleshing out of the setting and stories, especially Freya's line. super nice anime pc game! I realy like it! you can play it!

949600,Intergalactic Fishing,game,False,"21 Apr, 2020","Indie, RPG, Simulation, Sports","Intergalactic Fishing is a fishing RPG that features procedurally generated content and graphics. Travel to lakes all over the universe and catch unique fish, explore uncharted lakes and sell data, complete quests, upgrade your gear, compete in fishing tournaments, design your own lures, and more!","Imagine if No Mans Sky was top down and only about fishing and you would have Intergalactic fishing. Don't let the simple graphics fool you, the ambiance and gameplay is great and the story is solid too. Well worth the current sale price of $3 A simple and cute little fishing game with plenty of side activities and things to do, attracting different kinds of fish with custom built lures and learning the ins and outs of the ecosystems is enjoyable and satisfying. best deal in the spring sale hands down, so much fun, one of those ""oh crap the sun is coming up..."" games... lol for better or for worse. Silly little fishing game, feels a little basic after a while but it's cheap and cozy. Would buy a sequel. absolute hidden gem Fishing games... I remember one of the first ones I ever played was at a friend‚Äôs house. Back then, full games were hard to find, but there were these magazines selling shareware compilations on CDs. One of those had a fishing game. Needless to say, the limitations were pretty clear, but I definitely made the most of it.

Years passed, and more fishing games came out, each with its own unique take. Some focused on graphics, others on mechanics, some on realism... But in the end, the goal is pretty much the same: Just kill time and relax (subjectively) while trying to catch a fish.

Intergalactic Fishing is a mix of fishing and space exploration. I mean, you don‚Äôt exactly hop into a spaceship and go exploring other planets, but you use a device that teleports your boat to random lakes across the universe.

The main story revolves around a lake where the fish are dying, and it‚Äôs up to the protagonist to figure out why. To do that, you need to travel to other lakes and complete missions, which helps move the plot forward. There‚Äôs a ton of different fish to catch, each with their own quirks and preferences. Because of this, item customization and combinations are pretty deep, even letting you craft your own bait. There are also upgrades that allow you to carry more bait and fish.

When it comes to graphics, music, and sound effects, I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre pretty basic, but honestly, that doesn‚Äôt really affect the fun factor. The gameplay itself can be frustrating for beginners since the randomness often pushes you into a trial-and-error loop that can get pretty tiring and annoying. However, once you get the hang of it, things get easier, though I still remember needing to take a deep breath every time I decided to explore a random lake in the cosmos.

That said, I thought this concept was amazing from the very first moment I saw it. This kind of creativity is something you typically find in indie games, and it‚Äôs a blessing that developers have the space to create these kinds of concepts. I really hope they refine this formula in the future for other titles in the genre. Oh wow, this is going to be a fun game to dive into. It's very simple on the cover but I can tell this is going to be a journey with lots of options and customization. Glad I purchased this game! it good I am very much a lover of fishing in games.

This game satisfies that itch perfectly. 
While graphically the game is very simple -- this imo works well for it. It's a fishing simulation game first and foremost. There's an indepth lure system,  procedural generated lakes, handcrafted lakes, and tons of different fish.

I played around 5 hours today, and man -- this game rules. 

This games been sitting on my wishlist for a long time -- and I'm glad I finally decided to pick it up.

I do think the game could use a demo on the store page as imo the first hour or so was enough to sell me -- and I wish I could have experienced it sooner. It's a perfect chill + watch something on a second monitor game. Best fishing game I played. Great campaign",0.1073199588477366

4. Not bad background music in an awful short loop.
5. BUGS GLITCHES and more BUGS. After reaching one of the chAckpoints and then dying, the game went crazy, removed floor tiles and binded the character with some invisible chains so the froggy couldn't move in any direction. Couldn't even kill itself.

Ocean Diver is, I think, the prettiest,  Space Detective is proving to be the hardest and Stampede is sort of in the middle. The three games are really all the same, they even use the same music, they are cheap and they are fun. 

There is a lot of criticism of the game for being short. I've played it and it does feel like that. All the games are short and timed and after completing, or failing, one the player is bounced back to the menu so there is no feeling of progression. However the more I play the bigger the population in my city gets and that's what unlocks Steam achievements .So if you want a quick shot of space based action this probably is not for you, if you want something that will give you  lot of quick achievements this probably is not for you.

Basically this is a cheap, fun game that is easy to pick up and put down and it is a bit different other games I've played. I find Space Detective to be quite challenging and it demands my full attention when I ply it as the differences between the ships are really minor. 

Since the three games are so similar I'd probably get either Space Detective because it's tougher or Ocean Diver because it's prettier. Cute little time-waster. For $1.50 (sale) you can't go too wrong.

It's basically Where's Waldo but with moving parts and a different target each time. It is the same thing over and over again with more of everything as the levels get harder. The backgrounds also switch from dark to light which can really mess with you depending on the ships you're assigned to look for. Even on Easy mode, I was alternating between finding my target instantly to staring at the screen for the entire time limit and never once seeing any of the ships I was looking for thanks to the background being a color that camouflaged the ONE little thing that would have made my targets stand out on a different background.

Hard mode really amps up the number of ships (from 400 to 800) scrolling across the screen and gives you more targets to keep an eye out for. Everything moves faster, too.

You get a score based on how much time you have left after shooting your last target but that score doesn't seem to do anything or unlock any fun new goodies. There are also VIP ships that show up randomly, but only in hard mode. The game could probably benefit from some power-ups or unlockables.

As for the other aspects of the game:

Music/sounds: Only able to turn off or on, no sliders.  Music is actually not too bad, even if it's the same tune forever and ever.
Resolution: I can't find any options in-game for resolution other than the + button in main menu that either makes it fullscreen or some preset windowed resolution that you don't get to choose.
Achievements: There are NOW achievements pertaining to shooting the VIP ships but there aren't any based on scores, so I have no idea what good scores are.

To wrap it up: as I opened with, it's a nice time-waster for the price. Simple, it works, and it's chill. Probably a good one for winding down before bed but once you've got all the achievements, there probably isn't much reason to keep going.",0.07198433611477091
2975030,Lust Shot,game,False,"6 Aug, 2024","Action, Indie, Strategy","Immerse yourself in the exciting world of &quot;Lust Shot&quot; - a visual novel with action elements, where each victory brings you closer to solving dark secrets.","TL;DR Don‚Äôt bother.

The premise is that you are a highschool student and you have died and gone to purgatory [spoiler]Actually you have not you are in a secret facility being kept as breeding stock and no I am not joking[/spoiler]. You must play Russian roulette with this annoying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so quirky‚Äù chick because she tells you if you win three times you will be ‚Äúisekaied‚Äù into a new life. When you win (the first two times at least) you get rewarded with a sex scene, of which you get what you paid for in terms of quality, low quality that is (honestly just look something up on the internet if you are that horny). I don't know what happens after you win for the third time I gave up.

Gameplay is you and the girl have 5 hitpoints each every time you shoot at each other RNG decides if you miss based on what is in the gun, i.e. 4 bullets and 2 blanks gives you a 67% chance of a hit. You can choose to shoot at the girl or yourself, if you miss the girl or take damage your turn ends. But wait there‚Äôs more there are cards you can play on your turn to shoot in the air, regain an HP, or deal 2 damage instead of 1. There also is a chance to dodge a bullet in which case the current turn ends. Does that sound fun? Because it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs a frustrating RNG fest that seems to favor the computer.

The visuals are amateurish and bad, but you can see that from the store page.

The sound/soundtrack gets grating after a few minutes the voice actress gets annoying and I cannot believe they actually read some of the lines without protesting that no human talks like that.

I lasted 1.5 hours in this game although the gameplay loop is only worth 15 minutes. I give this a 2 out of 10. Got it for 3 euros and it's worth it.
the story sucks, the bot cheats a lot but the gameplay is what I wanted and the music suprisingly slaps.
Just do yourself a favour and play without the dodge feature
 what the fuck Too little thing while bad game experience Lust Shot is a short but still alright game. It is simply just russian roulette but with the same mechanics as buckshot roulette. Although there was potential for some strategy, that was all thrown out the window with the dodge mechanic which just steals your turn after completely negating your shot. Of course you can turn the dodge mechanic off, but that just feels like a waste to not play with the original mechanic in the game. The dodge itself could have been a great addition to the game play if it were not so heavily rng dependent. Although it was frustrating spending most of the game not getting a turn I still had fun for how short the game is. The story is good for how short everything is, but nothing super amazing either. I enjoyed the character art for sure. 
Overall for the price I would say Lust Shot is worth it, and I look forward to seeing how the dev improves in the future. 4/10: beat it on the hardest difficulty, and it was incredibly frustrating and unfair, though winning felt good because of it. For the price, I would give it a 6.5/10.

You should only play this game if you have nothing to do for a couple hours and you're feeling a little horny.
Play this game on the hardest difficulty; the rush of victory combined with your need to bust a nut should make the H-Scenes worthwhile enough to complete the game.

Also, the story is shit and the ending is corny, But, again, the H-scenes are good enough to convince you to want to keep playing. [code]This game was [b]NOT[/b] provided by the publisher.

Having had your first date with Truck-kun while commuting to college, you find yourself in a room with boarded up windows where a beautiful girl in a sailor uniform asks you to play russian roulette with her for a chance at getting isekaied.

[h1]Review[/h1]
Well, this was a very short experience, about 20-30 minutes, and there isn't multiple endinge, which I would expect when the main story is this short. The price fits what you get though, so this is more me wanting more rather than anything else. Perfect for you if you want to kill about half an hour somewhere during your day. Game is about the price of a chocolate bar, and offers about as much enjoyment. Looking forward to future games by this dev.
[/code] I found 'Lust Shot' to be a fantastic short game that evokes the spirit of Danganronpa with its engaging narrative style. The story is both good and simple, striking a balance that keeps players intrigued without overwhelming them. The animations were great, adding a visually appealing layer to the experience, and the game mechanics felt refreshing and innovative. I would highly recommend 'Lust Shot' to anyone interested in trying out a Hentai game for the first time, as it‚Äôs approachable and enjoyable for newcomers In 40min i managed to beat this game twice in order to find a replayability (there is none).
Poor game design, developer doesn't understand the concept behind ""Russian roulette"" and how it works/should work, despite the fact that this is a core gameplay here.
Not recommend. 35 minutes game on the medium level. 2 H scenes, some insane plot. Crap",0.04844997594997594

For me it's just simply not finished game with good quality and idea, but somehow it doesn't impress me at all. Just don't. The game is completely unfinished. There are no instructions.

The GP40 was designed to haul tonnage, and with four axles and a robust 3,000 horsepower, the locomotive was ideally suited for intermodal and fast freight duty,...","On sale, sure. Not for full price, it's too old with too little to offer in the pack for full price to be justifiable. The overall model looks really nice, but the sounds are yet again recycled from every friggin american commuter pack that DTG pushes out. It literally sounds just like the NJT F40 CAT pack, which is so very wrong. The commuter cars are the same Comet cars we see in literally all of the NJT packs, nothing special there. Physics are not an existing feature lol. Fellow Railfans and Train simulator players,I recommend this fast girl to any of you. Probs one my favorite trains I ever purchased. Im sure theres others. :D This locomotive is fantastic one of the best DTG did a great job with this I give it 10 of 10. The loco looks nice, unique to TS.
Being used more extensively in real life, you can take it to most routes (Quick Drive). It can handle grades.
Also used by 3 scenarios in the additional packs if you fancy those.

Sounds are the usual F40 sounds, better than the stock SD40 but far from an EMD.
Safety systems also trigger the UK warning sounds, from the old Class 47. Loud, scary and inappropriate.
Comes with an old safety system device so you don't really know the aspect or speed limit.
The self-lapped brakes apply so quickly, stuttering is an actual problem.
Scenarios require you to ignore signaling and just race. Gets you fired IRL. Some timetable stops are impossible.
With number boards missing, it's a fair bet that these were ran exactly 0 times during design & testing.
Weather settings for the first scenario have been recently messed up.
Comes with the standard NJCL wagons, not even a matching cab car.

Somebody should fix it and then this would be a blast.

The F40 pack complements the route better with focusing on the diesel section. This is an amazing game for operating various trains across the globe. Its pretty easy to edit and customize your own trains and routes as well. Only downside is the DLC can be a bit expensive, but if you wait for a sale then thats not even an issue. Nevermind what I said before. I just found out that you have to look for the correct scripting for the cab car when making a train with this locomotive. (E.g. Look for the option called ""[GP40]Comet V Cab Car"" or [MT] Comet IV Cab Car (Diesel)."" 3D modelling is good, as are the textures. The sounds are average as usual.

Overall, I would say this is an average DLC for now (untill patched), as there is still an issue with the number lights: when lighted, the number boards will display nothing but bright light (alpha mask issue ?). its a classic that's be serving since NJT was formed. made even better now that the ALP46 pack released the multilevels. good sounds, decend bell ok horn. i just wish the horn didn't auto trigger the bell. it also has a differn't more classic breaking system than the rest of the NJT stock. The New Jersey Transit GP40PH-2B is not a bad DLC, but is lacking in some areas. Unlike the F40PH-2CAT, it does not have a toggleable HEP engine. Like all NJT DLC, it has the run-of-the-mill Comet IV coaches and Comet V cab car (Which is configured as an electric locomotive, rendering it inoperable on non-electified routes). I was massively disappointed with that as I would've loved to see DTG produce another model of NJT coach, such as a Comet V or IIM trailer coach, or even a Comet IV cab car (Atlantic City Line trains often ran with Comet IV cabs; Hoboken Division trains are typically straight Comet Vs) to go with this DLC. I was disappointed that this model lacked opening windows or doors akin to most recent DTG offerings.

The model quality is great as with most of DTG's offerings, and the sounds are generally of an acceptable standard (There are two payware sound packs for this engine). Physics are fine, but it would be best to download Fan Railer's physics mod. The included scenarios aren't the best, but the wintry Bay Head to Long Branch one should keep engineers on their toes.

Finally, I can primarily recommend this DLC to NJ Transit diehard fans such as me. Overall score for this DLC is a 7/10. Amazing DLC, i love the detail and the look, but doesnt come with great sounds though. 8/10",0.24904822029822024

RATING AT THE BOTTOM

I gotta be honest i've never said this before but this mf is walking simulator. Honestly the game could be so much better if we weren't so lost not knowing if we've done something or not by walking into the same room for the 9th time. The game was scary and definitely landed the atmosphere i was scared half the time but the other half i was so confused and lost. then out of nowhere someone pops up in front of me or runs at me and now all the sudden my underwear is brown. This game would be soooooo much better  if we didn't have to do soooooo much walking.

I'D RATE THIS GAME A 5.8 OUT OF 10 

I would rate it higher if it wasn't so much walking. I would also rate it lower if it wasn't as scary worst game ever walking simulator not a horror game we got a bug at the end of the game !! we couldn't find the Key and finish the game :(( MY FREIND TOLD ME TO PLAY IT ANDDD IT'S SOOOO BADDD I NEEDED TO WAIT 50 MIN FOR THE LAST JEY AND THERE IS NOTHING IN THAT TIME LAST KEY NEED 50 MIN TO SPWON YEAH IF U HAVE THE TIME TO WASTE JUST WALKING GO WALK IN REAL LIFE This game hits different when you Arab\Muslim, cuz the Quran phrases and everything is spot on , gave me a mini heart attack. but at the end the game glitched and got stuck on the quest before last and the escape key never spawned.",-0.0877124183006536

The successor to the Citybus O 305 was a very popular vehicle and is still in use today thanks to its robustness.,"I didn't get the DLC with the mod, for some reason, then I tried to reinstall it, BUT IT WANTS ME TO PAY AGAIN!!! WHY?!
 detailed and flawless usage

con is the o405g likes to move and glitch a bit when the doors are open at a station but it fixes after you close them Wow this is a absolute beauty of a bus! I love the O405G gangway. So nostalgic! I would say this a very easy bus to modify. it also have a sound mod for it to have ZF and Voith varients. Repainting is some of the easiest one i done and the layers really helps to make the bus look nicer. Even the prices arent that high. Furthermore, I do love how much setvars there are for this bus, IBIS Destination controller, Rollband numbers to LAWO Flipdot! However, repainting requires you to drop the main layer opacity to 5% or some texture error will occur. I will definetly reccomend this DLC to all OMSI Players out there

Pros: 
Easy to repaint
Have many configurations
Easy to mod
Bus is very neutral

Cons:
Bus repainting requires you to drop opacity.

Overall: I would give a 10/10 for this DLC! Best i have ever given!!! Good Job Pedro! Really nice bus, nice to drive.

The bus is customizable, you can change ticket machine, doors etc my only issue is some of the ticket/ibis machines are difficult to use.

7.5/10 its not repaintable no templates : ( i cant reccomend it for that reason alone The O405 started service in the late 1980s, and started to replace buses such as the O305 and MAN SL200. Overall, a very well executed add on with quite a few good points, and very little to be upset about, and possibly one of the best buses that can be bought for the sim. 

Pros:
+ Customization options including ticket printer type, doors, rollband/matrix displays, dashboard variations, and possibly more.

+Small details that can be opened, such as the boot lid in the back, showing the engine at work.

+Multiple Paint Jobs, with most made for the maps that can be bought for the sim, including 2 BVG paintjobs that would fit Spandau just well. Community also made multiple paintjobs, and there is also a O407 that needs this DLC to work. 

+Solo and Articulated versions. 

+Very well detailed. 

Cons:
Really, non. Possibly one of the greatest addons made for the Sim. Price is a little steep as of 2020, but thankfully it goes on sale, it's worth it. gtvfvftbcfbvfrc I love parts of this bus! We got cool rain and snow effects on the bus! 2 models does not stop the fun. We can customize the bus like the doors, destination sign, etc. and we can open different doors outside the bus like the engine door. You can even drive with the doors open! These buses are very enjoyable. They drive really smooth and I like the way the destination display is like the old Berlin MAN SD200 with separate parts per line digit and per letter. It's also nice that you can open a lot of hatchets at the outside of the bus when you simulate malfunction of the bus, that you can stop somewhere and open them for example. The style of the interior is also quite unique for the Oxxx series in my opinion. And with also having a roll band variant the complete nostalgic experience is complete. O405s in this DLC are way better than those in three generations DLC and Hamburg day and night DLC! 
Apart from every amazing deatil, the manual also told you how to change the type of display,hubcaps and so on,  brillaint!!! O(‚à©_‚à©)O",0.2348134853603604
645440,Tearstone,game,False,"19 Jun, 2017","Adventure, Casual, Indie","Embark on an exciting adventure helping the mysterious Professor with an incredible discovery in Tearstone. Explore magical locations, uncover priceless artefacts and discover an array of interesting characters.","While I enjoy HoGs, even ones that feel really old, I was determined to play to the finish until I reached the halfway point. I don't know if there's a bug in this chapter, but I missed one object in a scene I couldn't seem to find and another never showed up and then I couldn't go back to get the object I needed. After that, I've had it freeze several times in the middle of game play and I've had it freeze upon trying to load the game. I hate to abandon games, but this isn't the first one I've encountered with such issues.

I would not recommend this game at full price. Just another game I played recently with a game breaking bug and this is so disappointing because I was really enjoying this game. 
nice illustrations, pleasant atmosphere, cute story,  well no need to go on because I was on chapter 6 which is nearing the end so playing for a while ( note my recorded time is only because I don't play it all at once but keep it active since I tend to come back to games sometimes later on and just keep it active).

this is the bug .  [spoiler] While getting the cross for the monk, the game crashes when using lighter on the paper to reveal one of the rubies. [/spoiler]

so I will have to put a NO to getting the game because I want others to avoid the disappointment of playing nearly all the game only to have it crash and also not be able to continue because within the game this bug prevents you from obtaining the needed item.

disappointed! Graphics of 90's, bleak artwork, hint system virtually useless. Can't scale/crop for wide screen. Was it really designed in 2011? After playing for only 30 min this game froze on me.  Then it wouldn't even load to let me play!! Tearstone is a bit old, so the graphics could be more detailed and there is no HDR graphical effect to light up the dark areas.
However, it is less easy than the typical hidden object game, which for me is a good thing because recent HO games tend to be of the sort ""Click here, my dear child"" and/or ""go forward, go back, go forward, ..."".
The cursor is not always very helpful and a sharp eye is sometimes needed to locate items in half-darkness. What's more, and more interesting, a touch of creativity (some would say less logic...) is needed to get some of the objects or puzzles.
On the whole, we enjoyed it and, with a bit of patience, we didn't need any hints. This is a very old HO puzzle adventure story and would have been B grade even then.  Graphics are grainy and dark.  Objects very small.  Keyboard controls are very clunky and didn't react fast.  Story was ok, but nothing extraordinary.  There was a game stopping bug in the 6th chapter which stopped me playing.  I was glad to stop as I was getting bored.  I don't recommend it due to the bug and poor graphics.  Thumbs down from me. I didn't love this game. But I didn't hate it either. It had enough in it to keep me occupied...and because I'm not exactly the smartest nor the best of gamers: it probably took me longer than it should have. Some of the goals/puzzles were a tad vague (IMO) and left me scratching my head, but like I said--not the sharpest tack n the box here. Hooray for me that I managed to figure everything out. 

Tearstone is a hidden object game. It has a story that takes you on a quest to various locations where you have to find objects, talk to characters, complete goals, etc, etc... in order to fulfill your sacred destiny and make everything right with the world. The story is pretty simple. However, at times the puzzles can be frustrating. There are no clear instructions on some of them, which left me clicking on random things like an idiot 'til the solution just sort of fell into place. 

This is a nice, casual game. I honestly picture this more on something like a mobile phone or tablet, but I still enjoyed playing it.",-0.024532757547463414

After the previous keeper has gone missing, you need to take over his duties and watch after the light.","crap I really wanna like this game more, but its just not mechanically giving what it needs to. I haven't beat it, and I don't intend to. The vibes and visuals are immaculate, but the story just veers off in a whole different (bad) direction, and some of the scares feel a little flimsy. A third of the way through the game items are moved around and the light randomly goes off, it feels like the moth monster is just fucking with you and not in the spooky sadistic hunter way. The monster POV chase scenes are a cool concept but completely fall on their face, and the monster design is a bit underwhelming. The devs are clearly talented, and I hope they keep making stuff, and maybe even take a second crack at this story. But right now, I can't really recommend this game. This game gets lovecraftian horror! the entirety of the story felt like a lucid dream that just can't seem to stop, which is a common theme in lovecraftian fiction and other inspired works! it was beautiful... 8.5/10 This is easily going to be one of my all time favorite games that I will come back to. I paid for it, didn't receive for free. It's the perfect blend of cozy & creepy & calming & scary. The atmosphere is just right, great audio, & the ps1 style graphics enhance the sensations.

I haven't read the other reviews, so I don't know why it has ""mixed"" (as of this writing) but I'm glad to have found this game. This atmosphere is exactly what I'm hoping to find when searching for hidden gems & I do believe this is a hidden gem. To me this is a perfect example of why you should ""disobey"" recommendations & give some things a try.

No spoilers, don't worry, but basically I'm pretty on-the-fence about whether to recommend watching the movie ""The Lighthouse"" with Dafoe & Robinson (though it's probably unrelated.) Personally, it amplified the atmosphere for me since I have seen the movie. 

Once you beat the game, there are a few more things you can do, so don't miss out on that. shits crazy I keep lighthouse, something break lighthouse and i am not happy.
Please no break lighthouse or my sanity. A boring walking simulator that loves wasting your time. Got stuck behind a chair. The World's #1 PS1-themed A24 Simulator.
 Complete random things without any sense. You go there ‚Äì nothing, you go back ‚Äì nothing, you go back and something open. Glitchy stuff with dark black ugly pixel graphics.
Example: Day one was glitch for me, because I dont bring the suitcase from docks. I was stuck in endless loop of day two and suitcase was in house.
Creators knows that and some stages you can skip after a few deaths.
Dont recomend A short, narrative driven game with a lighthouse, but no scenes of Robert Pattinson jacking it.
Starts off interesting, however it quickly introduces 2nd person chase sequences which control horribly and will get you killed several times, as well as spoil the monster way too early. Then in the second half a bare bones plot becomes overly cryptic with Lovecraftian locations and constant perspective changes just to confuse you and seem to be more sophisticated than they actually are. Who am I playing as now? Are these memories? Is it the past, present, or future? What is even happening? I read other reviews and it seems that the Director's Cut added these sequences and I think it ruined a compact experience with unnecessary, generic bloat that doesn't know when to end.

832500,3 Minutes to Midnight¬Æ - A Comedy Graphic Adventure,game,False,"22 Aug, 2024","Adventure, Casual, Indie","In a race against time, Betty embarks on a thrilling, comedy-packed adventure to crack a conspiracy that starts with a bang and ends at 3 Minutes to Midnight.","excellent A wonderful point and click adventure game! Multiple solutions to each puzzles, great jokes and references to other games and movies, overall a fun time, and the game has multiple possible endings to get!

I enjoyed the unique looking art style they got going on for this (a point and click HAS to have a nice art style in my eyes, and this one does!).

I hope for a sequel and/or other point and click adventure games from this studio! 
 ‚Äã""3 Minutes to Midnight"" is a delightful throwback to the golden age of point-and-click adventure games. From the moment I stepped into Betty's shoes, I was captivated by the game's vibrant, hand-drawn visuals that exude a charming, cartoonish appeal. The attention to detail in each scene is remarkable, making exploration a genuine pleasure.‚Äã

The narrative is a rollercoaster of humor and intrigue, filled with quirky characters and unexpected twists. Betty's witty and sometimes mischievous personality adds depth to the story, and her interactions with the eccentric townsfolk often had me laughing out loud. The puzzles are cleverly designed, striking a balance between challenge and logic, and I appreciated the multiple solutions offered for various scenarios, which added a layer of replayability.‚Äã

The voice acting is top-notch, bringing each character to life and enhancing the overall immersion. The soundtrack complements the game's atmosphere perfectly, with tunes that evoke a sense of nostalgia while remaining fresh. While the game does have its moments of lengthy dialogue, I found that it contributed to the rich storytelling and character development.‚Äã

Overall, ""3 Minutes to Midnight"" is a charming and engaging adventure that successfully captures the essence of classic point-and-click games while introducing its own unique flair. It's a must-play for fans of the genre and newcomers alike. It's a really good point and click adventure, almost on par with the classics of the genre but slightly misses the mark (in my opinion). The story is unique and intriguing, even if at first it might not seem it. The characters are well written, dialogue well written and voice acting on point for the era and characters.

There is a lot of dialogue. A LOT. My only complaint is not being able to skip dialogue that involves playing any sort of animation. Or skipping certain, repeated animation sequences. This was a tedious part of the game for me, anxiety inducing, even!

If you enjoy a good point and click adventure with a focus on story then give it a try! Fun & Funny! I just started the game and I would totally recommend it, as point and click games fan I can say that this game is from the few Point and Click games that has sharp graphics. I just wish Broken Sword to learn how to make their games look better and sharp like this one. The game seems well put from the menu to the game play.

Update: I couldn't continue the game half way, story is bit long and boring with so much conversations, and the the environment is repetitive, same place and characters.  I really wanted to like this game. A classic style point and click adventure, with great graphics and animation. A mix of old Lucasarts and Sierra games, but unfortunately overshadowed by lengthy and uninteresting dialogue and automated scenes - a lot of which cannot be skipped. This makes it more a cartoon/interactive story on rails than a game. I suspect writers and voice actors were a lot cheaper than graphic artists and animators.

Pick up everyhing, talk to everybody and it is quite obvious when and where the items should be used - with a few exceptions. Repeat.

Betty is an annoying protagonist, and so is the voice acting. Her mother is a bit better. The story is meh, so is the humor. The most funny part was the death scenes. 

In-game achievements might seem as a good idea, but I don¬¥t believe anyone would replay the game to unlock all of these. 

The few puzzles in the game seem to have been added in hurry towards the end. The game is not very challenging, the most challenging is to endure all the meaningless dialogue and automated scenes. Amazing setting and story, reminds me a lot of the Deponia Game series in the style and humour.
10/10 would recommend! one of the best adventures i ever played. An ALL TIME CLASSIC Great game. I live these point and click adventure! This one is marvelous!",0.13683054883712772

Tiny Epic Quest on TTS is like having the board game itself. The ""system"" does a few ""auto"" features in the game but otherwise you move your meeples manually and your tracking tokens and your cards and the dice rolls.
The game looks to be fun. I own and have played several other Tiny games and like them all.  They are all different and all fun to play. 
Good games. 
Tabletop Simulator is a blessing to gamers who learn to use it ( a bit of a challenge but what gamer doesn't like a challenge?). Adorable little game with easy automatic setup and straightforward rules. Fun to play both with and without other people. Gonna grab a physical copy if only for the cute ITEMeeples and their equipables :) Super cool game concept, me and a friend had a blast playing it last night. i have one issue, where it was saying my friend had to also purchase the DLC, i looked and only i shouldve had to buy it.. if you can look into that or make sure that the host thing is working before you buy it, then its worth it Our library has the physical version, coworker told me about the Steam version and I had to have it. Very satisfied, game play went well, mechanics work great, resolution good, can see rule book no problem on zoom in. 

For beginners: Couldn't figure out how to start the game. Told by some helpful others that you click on your name in the upper right of the screen and choose a player color to ""sit"" down at the table. That lays out the board and starts the game. From there you mostly manually move your pieces, but some of it is automated like when you pull a quest you complete, it automatically draws another. 

Also, seems like you need to do part of the resolution first yourself before hitting the resolve round button. Return applicable meeples to their castle, pull any completed quest cards and goblin tokens before clicking the resolve round button as that will set/refill the board and quests for the next round. Awesome game, with very cool rulebook that you can actually flip through. The new item meeples are the future of gaming! Easily modifiable and so diverse. Table auto setupts very fast. Comes with singleplayer mode.. Highly recommended if you're a fan of Tiny Quest like me. Love it!",0.12805188891254463

Everything just feels generic here. Including the art style.

Had a bug with a box that stayed at my display, until I restarted the game. Happened after the first startup.. and never again.
Did you know, there is a """"""""""NEW"""""""""" versus mode? Well the game will remind you every time, before it lets you into the hub area!

Audio is pretty low, even though it is at 100%..

There is.... There is a fucking armory in the hideout... but you can't take anything into or out of the mission areas,...

The storm sorcerers... they cast the storm from far away, hidden behind some stuff and there is nothing that we can do... Until their first storm ends and another begins..

Escort missions... wow... Followed by lighting fires... WHERE YOU HAVE TO APPROACH THE THING YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO LIGHT ON FIRE, BEFORE YOU GET ANOTHER TORCH?! FUCK THIS GAME!!!!!

It also doesn't help, that most of the talents, besides the last 2 to be unlocked, are plain boring.

What is worse, is that he can talk to you in the DLC missions, making them worse than the standard campaign.

At least the Witch Hunter and Dwarf are good.

[b]There are some positives[/b]
-Level design - This is the highlight of the game for me, they have done a fantastic job on that front.
However.. You can't even enjoy something... because every few minutes a horde gets summoned... Like it's overkill!

-Chaos wastes
Especially after reaching lvl 30 with one of the characters. It's fun to have the extra abilities that.. to be honest, would have been great in the base game too. As well as have more than one talent in a given row.
This game mode, is one of the few times I had fun with the game.

-The AI of the bots feels DECENT/OKAYish.

-Lore accurate special and elite enemies
I can only speak for the skaven and those are accurate. Armored, with shield, warpstone thrower, assassin, etc. all make sense as special/elite enemies, lore wise.

Shout out to indie devs. Lotte is an excellent, short platformer that introduces some truly innovative gameplay mechanics.

It‚Äôs a wonderful example of what small indie developers can achieve with creativity and passion. I highly recommend supporting the developer by picking it up ‚Äî it‚Äôs definitely worth the small price!

Shame they're never where created... Lotte is more of an interactive art piece than a game. It is a puzzle platformer, but with interesting Indie game mechanics.

It should be free if anything. Nice It's a neat and short puzzle game. Maybe too short for how well designed the puzzles were but considering it was probably not its main focus but rather the memorial of a passed loved one I'd say it did its job quite well and I can respect that.

Immerse yourself in the virtual reality world, take the wheel and feel the thrill of the most realistic kart racing that you've ever seen!","Ok, so you're not in the drivers seat, but it is still fun.  You get a 3D perspective of what you would see if you were playing the game on a monitor. Still it gives a level of immersion that is very welcoming. Some people don't like the fact of taking a ""flat""
game and making it VR without first person perspective, but after playing games on a tv or monitor for most of my life this is refreshing. It's no game of the year, but throw it on and have a little cart fun for not that much money. If you like cart racers, it's worth it. seriously for me personally i love this game, i just like the fact that it is a Kart Racer game similar to other kart racer games i have played like mod nation racers, Mario Kart and Beach Buggy Racing but it is in VR and i swear playing this game in VR compared, say to just playing it on a normal screen montior is truly a better experience in my opinion if Mario Kart and the other Kart racing games i mentioned could also be in VR and i could purchase them here on STEAM i would buy them in a heart beat Control are clunky. Even the f1 car feel clunky. Soundtrack is meh. No actual playable characters. The challenge is  while unforgiving. also a joke.  The game also played w/o the use of VR Heatsets. and getting game's star can be dickish. no post game reward (is a farce). The races are (Mostly) 2-lap races with one 3-lap race. My verdic is on this game. try with caution. don't recommand to all hardcore (but few) gamers or Pro Mario Kart Gamers, EVER! Unless you kill your cat with couriousity. My Score: 65 of 100

Update: It has been 5 (Soon 6) Years since the release of Kart Chaser: The Boost. 
I recently tried it and have mixed feelings about it. As a casual kart racer, it has potential, but it falls short in some aspects.

First of all, the fact that it is a bootleg version of the popular game Kart Rider is a downside for me. While I understand that it was made by small Korean developers, I would have preferred a more original concept. However, I appreciate the effort put into the game by Lee Jeong Min and Kim Sung Kyum.

The gameplay is what you would expect from a kart racer ‚Äì boost, drift, and use items to win races. The boost and drift mechanics work well, but I found the boost to be a bit weak during my play session. This may be due to programming, but it could also be improved upon.

There are two game modes ‚Äì Item Rush and Time Trial. Item Rush is a standard race with AI opponents and power-ups. The use of items is similar to Mario Kart and even Kart Rider, with some being more effective than others. I liked the feature of having different tiers for items, making them more powerful. The Power Tackle move adds some strategy to the game, but it can be hard to execute properly.

The track roster is limited, with only 13 maps available, which can get repetitive after a while. The kart selection is also limited, with only 13 to choose from and only one driver option. This is a letdown, as diversity in drivers and karts could have added more depth to the game.

The controls of the karts are similar to Kart Rider, but they feel a bit clunky. However, I wouldn't say they are terrible, just not as smooth as I would have liked. The graphics and soundtrack are decent, but not outstanding compared to other kart racers.

One interesting feature of Kart Chaser is its optional VR support. I did not use this feature, but it's a nice addition for those who do have VR headsets.

Overall, Kart Chaser: The Boost is a decent casual kart racer, but it doesn't stand out in a market filled with similar games. The limited tracks and karts, along with the lack of diverse drivers, is a major drawback. However, for its price point and the fact that it was made by a small team, it's worth giving it a try. For those who have a windows mixed reality; this game runs perfectly on it. I used a lenovo explorer and an xbox one controller to play. it runs with no problems on my gtx 1060 (6GB).  

Gameplay wise its a 10/10 for me. its basically a knock off mario kart but with a little VR touch to it. I definitely recommend it for the price (I bought it on sale for like $5, but would still pay full price for it) This game is cheap and easy to learn. It plays like Mario Kart. The grinding for better cars isn't bad. I highly recommend if you're looking for a cart racing game. Just doesn't feel right.  It's VR but it's 3rd person.  On the time trials, I easily won each race with absolutely no difficulty (even with a non-upgraded car).  The tracks look different, but they almost all play the same. You don't really ever need to brake for any reason, just keep boosting as often as possible.  On the Item Rush races, it just felt like random luck on whether you got a good item or not or whether one was used against you.  No real strategy here, just plain luck.  I could easily get ahead, but if an item was used againt me, I'd be back to last place.  

I just didn't have much fun, most of the races I did were boring.  I'm glad there's unlockables and it felt nice to get a new kart.  But that just made the races even easier.  I got this on sale for $6.99 and I can't recommend it for a VR experience given the 3rd person view.  So without VR, it's just a below average kart racter.  It's not Mario Kart snd it's not Sonic All-stars either.  It's just a poor version of those with 3rd person VR.  There's no multi-player either.  The single player is just unlocking cars and unlocking tracks.  But with little motivation to do either because of the above problems.

Rate 4.5/10 at least the price is right for the content, but I still can't recommend ... needs some more work to be good, and it's almost there but not quite I really enjoy taking a few laps in Kart Chaser each weekend as a warm up for deeper VR.

And this is such a great experience I look foward to more in the future, so I'm taking my time unlocking all the cars and features.

If you love 3rd person racing and VR, this is where its at. why I cant play on my win7 computerÔºü
when I launch the game the screen show pink color OUTLAW here, Im first place in most of the time trial races.  This game is pretty fun.  Reminds me of Mario Kart a lot.  I can't wait till we can compete with other players online.   Worth the price, spent a lot of hours playing this. The only Negative I can think of is there isn't Multiplayer.

This game really doesn't like it when you do that. it's a mess of a port but there's a really interesting game somewhere in there. baffling systems like charms and metal extraction are glossed over by the charming writing and surprisingly engaging combat. making your way through each story is a lot of fun, the character customization pops off after a couple runs, and also I love having sex with men! Jet J makes great sushi burgers There is likely a way to open the game but didn't succeed yet,too bad tho,I really wanted to try this game out ; seemed really great. love it 
 Fun game until you have to do the minigames. The minigames are push the button when ""X"" happens but its not consistent at all. Would give this game a thumbs up, but in order to get the ""best"" ending you have to do t he minigames. And the minigames are the worst thing to happen in this world, even worst then whatever you can think of. It's a goofy game that's very campy. I love the series, and had fun going back at it again.

how-to's and GameFAQs are your friend here when making powerful custom weapons and knowing how to get different endings. The game was very fun when it still worked and when it worked, I was SO ADDICTED to this game that I would play nothing but this for days sometimes even weeks. I spent a lot more time on Way of the Samurai 3 than I ever did any of the other games but I still REALLY liked this one. when I saw it on steam, I was excited to dive in. several months to a year or so later, i find out that this game basically doesn't work anymore, tried everything I could possibly find online but nothing worked, i would get as far as the load character/save menu but then I crash as soon as I try to load in. I can't even go into the settings without the game crashing on me. I have basically given up at this point and as much as it pierces my heart, I cannot in good faith recommend this port of the game in the current state that it is in. if you are really feeling the itch to play this game, i recommend digging out the good ole PS3 or even get the PS Now subscription on PS4. it's how I played it originally and I hope it's still there and if not, well, you're SOL. nice game for me the quality of this game is worse than way of the samurai 3 in every way. the cutscenes feel like stage plays, the audio is all over the place volume wise, the combat feels like shit. probably one of the worst games i've ever played and decided I had enough of it after only 30 minutes or so. this game is garbage.",0.033913043478260886
1059240,Room 208,game,False,"8 Aug, 2019","Action, Adventure, Indie","Victor Rockford, a spiritual medium has been asked to use his otherworldly abilities to stop the EVIL that resides inside Room 208 of 'The Great Leaf Hotel'. Does he have what it takes to put a stop EVIL? Or will the EVIL claim yet another victim?","Way too glitchy, very frustrating.... it's too bad because looks like it would be fun Although there are a few issues with the game play, I'm working my way through it and enjoying it thoroughly. The graphics are superb and I'm having a lot of fun with the puzzles which I think are very cleverly thought out. Keeping the lighter fuelled long enough to do a complete search of the various areas in the game is a real challenge and has had me starting a new game on several occasions each time avoiding having to search unrewarding areas. All in all great fun though and I'd highly recommend this game. Too many bugs for this to be on sale. The game also requires you to keep replenishing consumable resources, which is kind of annoying if what you want is to solve the challenges and so on.

This one needs to be pulled from the shelves and subjected to a lot more play-testing. For the price point that this game is at there are far better experiences to be had. The graphics of this game are beautiful and the voice acting is great, but beyond that there's not much else good to say. The mechanics of it are clunky and the choice of having your sanity meter go down even with the lighter out is abysmally infuriating. Every few seconds into a puzzle you have to run back to a ball of light as it's your only true light source and the only thing that will make your sanity go back to normal. The dude you're playing as only lasts bare seconds in the dark even with his lighter despite being a psychic who's likely used to these things--at least, he never sounds fazed when he has his voice lines. While one scare got me, it was unsatisfying. All the noises are canned and repetitive, with no real danger and they only serve to irritate you. For the price asked of this game you could play two other indie horror games that have more scares and more satisfaction than this one has to offer. I reserve judgement as I've not played the whole game yet but so far so good.  Decent atmosphere and sounds.  Puzzles so far have been ok, nothing to strenuous. 

Something to entertain my Sunday while its raining outside :) Pretty much everything about this game is terrible, which is a great shame, since the first Initiate was almost decent with a few clever puzzles and some interesting design choices. The sequel had a fantastic idea of playing as several characters stuck in different but neighbouring rooms helping each other, but it was seriously let down by bland and unoriginal puzzles.
Well, in Room 208 the inspiration has completely left the developers. The story is nonsensical and doesn't explain anything, the voice acting is horrendous, the writing is atrocious and still ridden with spelling mistakes. The puzzles require no logical thinking whatsoever, only observation. Most of them have been blatantly taken from previous games (arranging candles, rotating pictures, taking out books from a bookcase and so on). 
The idea of using lighter and having to refill it in order not to die in the darkness is also lacklustre. Since you have no quick saves, you just have to carefully go through each location, use all your refilling liquid to study it, then load the game and do everything that's necessary but ten times faster. Obviously, the game doesn't reward exploration and constantly hurries you to an extent that even forgets about some puzzles, which you don't have to solve at all.
The jump scares are awful and take away everything from the alleged 'horror' atmosphere. Startling isn't how you make a creepy game.
If you want some good puzzles, play the first Initiate. If you already have, stay away from Room 208 by all means.
3/10 is quite generous for it. Not a bad attempt at mixing horror with puzzles.  The puzzles are decent, some can be difficult, which I prefer.  Hate having my hand held.  Jump scares are ""OK"" and wouldn't say they were predicable or anything but are nothing special however the atmosphere more than makes up for it.

Overall a decent attempt, solid 7/10.

Pros:
- Atmosphere is great.
- Sound.
- Puzzles.
- Mix of tension and puzzles.

Cons:
- Proof reading.
- NPC animations.

One of the core mechanics of the game is that you have to wipe bird shit off your face every minute. I'm not kidding. There aren't even any birds flying above you, but you still have to wipe bird shit to see anything on your screen. Great.",-0.15897435897435896
422860,Holodance,game,False,"28 Feb, 2020","Casual, Indie, Sports","Released into Early Access as one of the first two VR rhythm games April 5, 2016, Holodance constantly evolved and continues to evolve: Punch orbs with your hands, slice drops with laserblades, shoot drones with guns or dance with dragons, with lots of different kinds of beatmaps!","Coming from Audioshield which I still really like this game is amazing.  I can still use my own music and the maps are PHENOMENAL!  I've only been playing free mode and less than 10 songs but I know it'll be taking the top spot over Audioshield, which I'll still play for a less active session. GREAT game and can't recommend it enough. I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.  - The game beat saber wishes it was. Native support for osu! tracks and LIV, and the ability to use more than just your hands for catching notes. Not to mention, mods if you so fancy. Best general VR rhythm game I've played so far. I'll be coming back for more. Highly recommended. The user interface needs work. I do not like having to click on an option 5 times in rapid succession for it to register that I clicked it. Also the main menu is a little overwhelming with all the lights, sounds, and options. As a beginning player, keep the more advanced options hidden away until I have accrued enough points to unlock it. And maybe add a tutorial? like how to navigate the menu, and how to play a song. I went into the first song with no idea what I was supposed to do with certain things, like the spiral. I was honestly too confused to have fun, which sucks because this game does look fun. Very enjoyable, nice bright colours, happy music which reminds me of Amiga-days, good work out and hand-eye coordination which also requires you to move your feet, arch your legs and change the stance quite a lot. I enjoy it more than Beat Saber both in graphics and movements. Excellent for taking a break from the seated mouse and keyboard position and getting some much needed alternative muscle movements. Heartbeat around 100 which is not too much and also not too much perspiration. Price is well worth it, I absolutely recommend. Exactly what I was looking for!  I have been scouring all the VR dancing and rythm games looking for something similar to IIDX or Stepmania.  This game lets you download ranked osu! files in game and play them immediately.  You can download osu! and get unranked files for that, and the next time you start Holodance those songs will be added.  If the backgrounds could play videos and custom images it would be perfect. I can appreciate it for being one of the original VR dance/rhythm games, but it does not hold up to today when you have much better options. 

You have two options in the game, the original story mode, which is basically where dragons throw colored balls at you. The dragons are really pretty, but it all seems a bit random and out of place and I never really felt like I was ""dancing"".

The second option is a free mode, in which they don't seem to have any songs of their own (the UI is also a confusing mess to navigate). It's more all player made maps, which means you might find something you like if you dig far enough but there seems to be no ranking, so you will have no idea if the map you pick is actually *good* or not. 

Even with some of the expert and expert + maps I played, I didn't really get that dance feeling like you do in something like Audio Trip, Beat Saber, or Synth Riders, unfortunately. 

I appreciate the fact that apparently it supports LIV mixed reality and foot trackers, but unfortunately I could get neither working with this particular game. The avatar in LIV would work, but then after a few seconds of being in the game it would be obscured by black screen. Holodance also could not pick up my foot trackers despite giving them roles in the Steam VR settings. After seeing some gameplay videos on Youtube, I really wanted to like this game. But after playing Beat Saber for about 2 years and just getting into Synth Riders, I could not find this game enjoyable.

This game probably could have done without the story mode, but it is an interesting idea and it was created before free play mode, which is the only thing that can remotely make anyone want to keep playing is if they like or have played osu.

Pros:
Has access to the osu library. Many many songs to choose from. You may like this game a lot if you play osu.
The game has part of a story mode and I found the dragons charming.
Plenty of environments that are nice to look at.
Different ways to play, catching orbs, slashing orbs, shooting drones.
Lots of options in the menus to customize your gameplay.

Cons:
Practically no tutorial. There is a box to read on the main menu, but it tells you almost nothing about the game.
In all gameplay modes all of the notes can be hit with both hand interchangeably. Makes for dull gameplay.
Lots of options in the menu to the point it was hard to navigate through them.
It appears that you cannot fail songs.
The story mode is unfinished. I found the very 1st level not beginner friendly at all. There is no difficulty to choose from in story mode, only in free play mode. There is an option to unlock later story mode levels automatically, and maybe it is just that this option is broken. I wanted to see if the story got more serious over time, so I picked this environment with burning trees. It seems like only the first 3 areas in the story actually have songs. Although somehow I got a song from the 11th area playing with the menu still open. It started fairly busy, but the notes weren't spaced out much and then later on only would have the occasional 2 notes at a time and was rather boring. Likely an unfinished song and not supposed to be there. This later environments wouldn't deload unless I quit the game. Very buggy. Maybe this only happened because I didn't play through the entire story and skipped ahead, but even so if the developer gives and option to unlock later level to skip ahead, it needs to be tested to make sure the game isn't breaking when it is used.

Understanding that this game was the 1st VR rhythm game, it tries. But Beat Saber and Synth Riders do a much better job and if you want this because it has a shooting mode, get Pistol Whip instead. Only get this if you really like osu or have children who like dragons. You have to high five and fistbump the dragon to continue, it's kind of cute. Coming from osu! it's absolutely amazing to play all the songs you know and love in VR - all the sparkles when you hit make you grooving and also the osu! sliders are really fun when you move them with your arms and body. ‚ô™ 

The only part you have to know before playing, is, that you actually have to manage your osu! library and suitable maps (in difficulty, also the possibilty of completion - mania 7k is just impossible) in self-management and this takes a little time to find the maps, which sympathize best with Holodance's mechanic and gaming experience. 

Highly recommended for osu! players! :) By far my favorite active game on VR, next to Until You Fall. So many songs and a great challenge. A work of love from the developer. Prefer this over Beat Saber and Synth Rider",0.10842791005291

 I waited almost 9 years for this to go on sale to finally buy. in short all i can say is just play sid's revolution I really don't like writing negative reviews because I consider games a form of art and I believe artists should generally be respected, even if we don't particularly like the art made, because it's an expression or even extension of the artist's soul. Well, since there's none of that here I don't mind criticizing this game.  

""Cults and Daggers"" could have been a great game‚Äîmaybe even a masterpiece‚Äîhad it been made by, say, Paradox and not a single person who seems to have lost his passion for making games. That person is Rod Humble, a veteran game developer so there is no excuse for such a massive disappointment. This is somewhat infuriating given how unique the idea behind it was: control the destiny of a cult over a span of 7 ages, between the death of Buddha and the birth of Christ, to prevent the vengeful Elder Gods (angry over their worshipers' waning faith) from destroying the world. There's no other game on the market like that!

So, what went wrong, you ask? One could comment on the dated, freeware graphics used or the clunky gameplay and user interface (both of which could be easily and inexpensively fixed by hiring a freelancer to revamp them) but, honestly, both of those problems could have been totally overlooked had the creator put some genuine passion into the game. What I mean is that this is not a game as much as it's the skeleton of a game, a beta or proof-of-concept basically. Aside from the premise, there's no storyline to speak of: you either succeed at averting destruction or you get a game-over screen. Considering how much information is available both on the net and in any public library about the various types of cults of antiquity or earlier (e.g. the antediluvian fertility cults of prehistory that produced Venus figurines, Roman military cults like Mithraism, mystery cults like Orphism or those that worshipped the ""mother goddess"" Cybele, syncretistic Greco-Egyptian cults like that of Serapis or the Thracian/Phrygian/Greek cult of Sabazios, fertility cults known for their alleged sexual excesses like that of the ""Good Goddess"" mentioned by Juvenal, etc.), the game could have utilized that historical knowledge or been inspired by it to create a unique setting and atmosphere that would have drawn the player in and transported him or her into an unforgettable world. Instead, everything in this game‚Äîfrom the cults to the cult leaders to cities‚Äîis generic and absolutely lifeless. The only difference between the cult that you've created versus the others is the profile pic you select and the minor bonus you get from picking your power (e.g. more likely to convert nobles, more likely to convert peasants, better hiding ability for your disciples, etc.).

You then spend the rest of the tiresome game taking turns in which you send disciples to various cities and take actions in order to boost your presence or hurt the presence of other cults in order to accumulate a certain number of points and win the epoch. You can proselytize, set up a temple, assassinate rival disciples, commit blasphemy and try to blame another cult for it, engage in occult rituals (which is one of the few cool things in the game but even that gets tiring after the novelty wears off), etc. However, because there's no flavor text or anything special about your cult or your rivals' cults, you don't really feel all that immersed or invested in the outcome. ""Oh, I lost this epoch?"" ""Ah, looks like I won this epoch. Great..."" The best way to explain how it feels to play this game is to imagine playing a fantasy-themed children's board-game, but completely alone. That's the level of enjoyment you'll get from this game, if not immediately then certainly after a few hours of repeating the same actions over and over. Just try watching more than 20 minutes of game-play on YouTube, if you're skeptical about any of my claims. You'll probably want to give up after a few minutes.

That said, if you really want to try this game out for yourself, I'd normally say, ""Wait for a sale""‚Äîbut the developer doesn't believe in sales. This game is $30 and will likely always be $30. (Many years ago someone on the forums asked if he'd ever put ""Cults & Daggers"" on sale but, although he promised he would do so, it looks like he changed his mind because, aside from never having done so since the game's release in 2015, he also deleted the post where he said he would!) Do I think this game can be salvaged and become worth its price? Yes, with a lot of work and inspiration, definitely. Do I think it will be? Sadly, I don't, especially considering its last update was in 2016.

Luckily, for you, I bought this game so you don't have to. Zeitlich zwischen dem Tode des Buddha und der Geburt von Christus angesiedelt, ist [i]Cults and Daggers[/i] eine Religions- und Bekehrungssimulation. Unsere Aufgabe besteht darin, unseren kleinen Kult zu einem weltweit gepriesenen Glauben auszuweiten und dabei die Verbreitung der Lehren unserer Konkurrenten zu verhindern. Das dergestalt nie dagewesene Spielprinzip (wenn man von Billigspielen mit Lovecraft-Bezug wie [i]Evil Cult[/i] und [i]Elder Chaos[/i] absieht) ist freilich hochfaszinierend, verbirgt sich jedoch hinter einem sperrigen Gameplay und einer un√ºbersichtlichen Pr√§sentation.

Mir sagte einmal eine unvergessene Frau, nachdem wir uns erkannt (bibl.) hatten, sie habe bei unserer ersten Begegnung gedacht, ich sei ""eine harte Nuss"". Dergestalt verh√§lt es sich mit [i]Cults and Daggers[/i]. Das In-Game-Tutorial, bestehend aus simplen Grafikeinblendungen, ist jedenfalls vollkommen unzureichend. Mittlerweile hat der Entwickler auf der Shopseite selbst einen erkl√§renden Spielmitschnitt hochgeladen, der neben dem drei√üigseitigen Handbuch offene Fragen beantwortet.

Zu Beginn des Spiels erschafft man seine Religion mit Namen und Emblem und w√§hlt einen der drei zuf√§llig zur Verf√ºgung stehenden Glaubensj√ºnger sowie eines der vierzehn m√∂glichen Bonusattribute aus. Letztere erh√∂hen etwa unser Geschick, neue Anh√§nger zu rekrutieren oder das gemeine Volk auf den Marktpl√§tzen zu √ºberzeugen, f√ºhren zu erfolgreicheren Bekehrungsma√ünahmen bei den adligen Statthaltern, perfektionieren die Ermordung feindlicher Propheten oder machen die eigenen Verstorbenen zu M√§rtyrern, so dass sogar ihr Ableben zur Glaubensverbreitung beitr√§gt. Daraufhin befinden wir uns auf der Karte mit den St√§dten der hellenistischen Welt.

Hier vertrauen wir unserer Handvoll Propheten mit ihren individuellen Charakteristika attributverbessernde Aufgaben an. Wenn sie nicht gerade unerkannt mit der Stadtbev√∂lkerung verschmelzen m√ºssen, k√∂nnen sie in den Stra√üen zu den Massen sprechen, Anh√§nger fremder Lehren ausfindig machen und gewaltsam beseitigen, zur √úbernahme von Ortschaften die f√ºhrende Aristokratie missionieren, sich zur Religionsausbreitung oder zur Flucht vor einem Hinrichtungsbefehl in andere St√§dte bewegen oder sich den dunklen Kr√§ften des Okkulten widmen, um Rituale und Wundertaten zu vollziehen. Kommen unsere J√ºnger bei ihrer Pflichterf√ºllung um, m√ºssen √ºberdies neue Glaubenslehrer rekrutiert werden, die zu den vorgenannten Handlungen bef√§higt sind. In den St√§dten lassen sich unsere Getreuen ferner dazu anleiten, heimlich Zersetzungsma√ünahmen oder blasphemische Aktionen durchzuf√ºhren, um andere Kulte bei Machthabern und beim gemeinen Volk anzuschw√§rzen, oder durch den Bau von Tempeln und das Ausrichten religi√∂ser Feste den P√∂bel auf unsere Seite zu ziehen. Notfalls geben wir gar den Befehl, feindliche Weihest√§tten zu √ºberfallen und auszurauben.

Wir durchleben sieben, den historischen Gegebenheiten nachempfundene Epochen aus jeweils einigen Dutzend Runden, bevor die Geburt Jesu die europ√§ische Zeitenwende einl√§utet. Uns und unserer Konkurrenz stehen im Laufe des Spiels dabei immer mehr, maximal jedoch zw√∂lf Apostel zur Verf√ºgung, was den Glaubenskrieg fortlaufend komplexer gestaltet. In jeder √Ñra ist es unser Bestreben, im weltumspannenden Attribut ""Hoffnung"" die h√∂chste Punktzahl zu erreichen, welche sich wiederum aus dem Wert ""Glaube"" speist. Jene Partei, welche die meisten Zeitalter f√ºr sich gewinnt, geht als Sieger hervor.

Dar√ºber hinaus gibt es auch eine b√∂se Energie der alten G√∂tter, welche langsam die sogenannte ""Seele der Welt"" verschlingt und sich in unheiligen St√§tten auf der Karte manifestiert. Gegen diese Orte der Pr√ºfung k√∂nnen unsere Getreuen ebenfalls ziehen, wobei ihre spirituellen F√§higkeiten anhand ihrer Attributzahlen getestet werden. Bew√§hren sie sich, schw√§chen sie das B√∂se und verhelfen unserem Kult zu mehr Macht. Dieser Aspekt f√ºhrt das Spiel freilich in √ºbernat√ºrliche Gefilde, ist jedoch angesichts des generellen Religions- und Glaubensmotivs vertretbar.

[i]Cults and Daggers[/i] behandelt zweifellos eine nischige special-interest-Thematik. Wer sich nicht f√ºr fr√ºhe (und inoffizielle) Religionsgeschichte interessiert, sollte Abstand nehmen und vielleicht zu einem anderen versteckten Juwel greifen. Au√üerdem muss die grobschl√§chtige Pr√§sentation und die zuweilen hakelige Bedienung, vor allem aber die √§u√üerst un√ºbersichtliche Rundenr√ºckschau kritisiert werden. Das spannende Spielprinzip, der atmosph√§rische Einbezug zahlreicher antiker Bildzeugnisse und der d√ºster-chorale Soundtrack tr√∂sten jedoch √ºber diese Makel hinweg. Man sollte sich freilich im Klaren sein, worauf man sich einl√§sst - oder im Fall eines Fehlkaufs die rechtzeitige Opferung auf dem Refund-Altar vollziehen. It's difficult to thumbs-down this.

But for the price... I expected not quite the level of wonkiness in the game.  Basically the game says ""please put up with my quirks and strange behaviors, and you'll enjoy playing me.""  And if the game-play was really that good, I would have enjoyed it.  But I'm afraid that balance is right on the teetering edge - so some people will enjoy the game and forgive the technical issues, and others like me will not.

""Okay Frank -- what's so bad?""

- I can't select a better resolution in the game options, so I can read the teensie-tiny fonts that show what events happened on the last turn.  ""Go change your Windows resolution.""  Yeah ... well... okay I did that.  No I'm not going to do that every time I play.  I'm sorry.  Please fix your UI.  Were you waiting for a bad review before fixing it?  Consider yourself served.  Not everyone has the eye-sight to read tiny text - and this game makes me squint.

- There is no history of events for each turn - so I can't look back in time and see what happened to my cult over time - what turn some character died, etc.  If this history existed it would let me read it whenever I liked, and remember happenings and add more attachment to the characters.

- The map jumps around at the beginning of the turn - apparently to show events that happened.  But the animation doesn't freeze the mouse.  So when I'm trying to move around the map, I get it tugged away from me.  If there's going to be a ""this is the animation sequence of the new turn start"" - make it more obvious that it's a little mini-movie and don't let the player do anything with the mouse while the animation plays.  As it is, I feel like I'm battling some bug in the mouse control as I wrestle with it.

So what's to like?

- The music and art are great.

- The city names are shown in large print when you hover over them - which seems a bit like a geography lesson ""remember where the cities are"" mini-game.  If that was the intent (to make it a mini-game) then that is not bad.

- There are a lot of options - enough to inspire the courage to try certain strategies.

Generally this game seems to be hiding a sophisticated and interesting rule-set and game-play mechanism.  It would be a pity - but it seems like an inevitability - if new players are prevented from adopting and exploring this game due to technical issues and a not well thought-out learning curve. This is a great game! Cults and Daggers is a rare example of this sort of game being designed well, where it is actually engaging, fun to play, and true to the themes it involves. There are not many games of this genre of ""Cult Simulation"" around. I can only think of one other, called ""Evil Cult"" which is a free browser game that is also very fun and well designed, but much simpler than this. I highly recommend this game, especially if you ever wanted a good strategy game that simulates cult management and the religious, occult and supernatural themes involved. Along with this, the Classical Age setting and aesthetics, as well as the art design are marvellous.

I really like this game and it has great potential to be expanded upon. I hope with future updates, the game mechanics are made more complex and fine-tuned. I also would love to see an expansion with a campaign setting in contemporary times.

I finished the game recently. I saw from this that the game needs further development. Regardless, this programme is the kernel of a great game that needs more development for the game to properly flourish. Great game, worth it. Edited:
A nice little game with an intyertetsing strategy based premis. Devloper helped me very quickly to solve crash issues better than I have ever got from EA customer services or lack off.

Worth a buy in my opinion

To the Developer of Cults and Daggers.

I have been keeping an eye on this game since mid 2015. I have only recently decided to buy it as it seems to be like many reviewwers have said a breath of fresh air.

Unfortunatley I am having trouble playing the game. Starting Cults and Daggers in steam brings me to start menu. Start New game, Load, Save Settings etc.

When I play the game in either New game or Custom game it goes to a black background with a white square box in teh middle. Windows asks me when I click in the white box after 4 minutes of waiting if I want to close program or wait for program to sort itself out. 

I dont want a refunbd yet and want to see if I can fix whatever issue is happening with my game as I am a big strategy game fan

Hope this gets to the devloper.

Thanks

Satans This game has so much potential!  It's a great game that will keep you playing for hours, until you realize that it's a strategic clicker, and I found that the depth that I thought was there evaporates after you get past winning the first couple of ages.  I want there to be more about developing your cult as the ages progress, and elimination of the randomness of of the times inbetween the ages. This is an unusal game. Don't expect high grafics or an intricate storyline. 
In this game you control subjects of a cult and it's your job to spread it to cities, fight the upcoming darkness, sabbotage your or even kil your rivals and gain as much points as possible. It's complicated, difficult and very interessting.

I really liked this game, but i can see it's not for everyone. I would recommend that you first watch some gameplay footage before you buy it.",0.027696415155092816
1928450,dweeMIXED: Thwee Pack,game,False,"31 Mar, 2022","Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG","Have we reached the Golden Era? magicdweedoo presents a three-part tome that serves as a beacon for indie gaming, for centuries to come.","I've already played and beaten 2/3 of the games featured in this collection, and I just need to say ... OH MY GOD PLAY THESE GAMES. If you enjoy indie gaming, these should be sure to give you at least a few hours of entertainment. They're surreal, endlessly funny, super creative, and really just well-designed all around. The game Ticket in particular, is the kind of the game that is best experienced with no prior awareness, and with a small group of friends by your side. Highly recommend. This game is so good that I went to the shared toilet in my office, dropped a nasty floater, doused it with apple juice... then just left. No wipe, no flush, nothing. 

I did this hoping whoever discovered it would appreciate how the immense QUALITY of dweeMIXED: Thwee Pack managed to pull such a creative expression out of me.

To sum up this collection in the words of Winston Tang: ""OH SHIT!"" An incredibly value oriented way to play all of Magicdweedoo's games, with some nice 16:9 enhancement. All 3 games are of completely different genres, Ticket being a platformer game, New Ice York being an adventure game/rpg maker game hybrid, and Mealmates being a weird party game. 

All 3 games have a very distinctive atmosphere and sense of humor that has not been replicated outside of magicdweedoo's catalog. The sorts of people that will get the most out of this game are indie game enthusiasts that enjoy obscure and strange games, particularly weird clickteam freeware games from the 2000s, which all three of these games seem to channel the intense, anything goes energy of, though much more polished and enhanced. I'd say that an average first playthrough of all the games would last around 5-6 hours, but all three games are very replayable, ticket is a joy to speedrun and discover the secrets in, New Ice York is a journey I return to occasionally, and Mealmates is incredibly fun to play with unexpecting friends (which might be a lot to ask of gaming enthusiasts)

If you consider yourself an adventurous indie game player, I'd highly recommend this package, along with magicdweedoo's other freeware games you can find on his website. This is a compilation pack of three of Magicdweedoo's games. Now, you might have seen or played the free versions of these games before, and you might wonder why you should suddenly cash out for this. The reason is simple: these games are getting the premium treatment in this pack and are vastly expanded.

The original MealMates was an interesting mini game collection in its standalone version, but the version in this pack basically rebuilds the game from the ground up and features an overworld, new minigames, a storyline with a disgustingly charming comic, revamped art and animations, and many many unlockable recipes and clothes. It also has a multiplayer party mode, making this a lot of fun. It's comparable to Wario Ware while also being vastly different. Some of the minigames tie in to the story as well.

Then we have New Ice York. This deliberately crusty game is difficult to categorize, as it has elements of a detective/mystery/adventure game mixed in with many unexpected moments and sudden minigames. In a way, I would almost describe it as EarthBound if EarthBound was crusty, nasty, dirty and about a detective.

Anyway, the original New Ice York consisted of only chapter 1. This new version contains the entire rest of the game, which, turns out, more than doubles the gameplay length. The new parts were very entertaining to me. It [i]does[/i] have to be said, of course, that this kind of game would have to be your cup of tea. If you like hunting for secrets and don't mind talking to every single person in town between each bit of story progression, you might enjoy this.

Then there's Ticket, the shoe platformer (primarily). It is just as bizarre and interesting as the other two games. However, I'm actually not certain if there's more content in this game compared to the original version, because It's been a while since I played the original game. But I'm certain that there are secrets that I can't manage to unlock yet and I wonder if it's something I would have to do something for in the other two games.

Not that I've said ""crust"" a lot but it's more like... these games have a crusty style but they ARE quite polished games. Magicdweedoo has his style and it's something you gotta like, and I definitely do.",0.08974934291898577
1650550,Workshop Simulator,game,False,"10 Mar, 2022","Indie, Simulation","Workshop Simulator allows you to repair and refurbish items using a range of restoration mechanics such as disassembling, cleaning, sanding and painting. The accompanying story will immerse you in the nostalgia of tinkering with your grandfather.","great idea for a sim, also some really good work in implementing those ideas into the game.  unfortunately,  all the things that make a game great, rather than frustrating, have been overlooked.  i'll start with the glitches, zero attention has been given to fix prior problems with the game.  Many of which were reported when the game was released into early access.  Its been at least 2 years since I last attempted to play the game, but stopped to allow time for future patches to fix the problems.  Unfortunately, all the problems that existed back then, still exist now.  after looking at the community page, it is apparent that other player seem to also be experiencing the same frustrations. 

Main glitches for me were:

# The finished item would screw up the paint job you chose, leaving you with a multi coloured mess of a restored product.  which, when displayed around your house, would look like someone came and did a rainbow poo on your newly restore toy car or typewriter (for example).

# The other big glitch for me was the resolution.  I play on a 5120x1440 display.  And in the settings you have the option to select that resolution setting.  However, it cuts the bottom half of the screen off.  If you then attempt to drop it to a lower resolution, it then sends all my game icons on my desktop across my other 2 monitors.  Given there is over 200 icons, its some what of a pain to put them back in the order that I like. (im a little ocd like that)

Sadly I have given up on the title and removed from my library. [h1] A game with potential[/h1]

It had so much potential a shame that the devs the game has abandoned.
The story line was too short.
If they had added some sort of free play.
Where you could upgrade your shed and abilities.
Then was the game for me personal great Fun game, could use more things to use money on at the end game and some stain colors for wood. good way to lose track of time and still fun for this type of sim. Absolutely lovely. A bit tedious in the beginning, but once you upgrade, it's more satisfying :) Should have listened to the reviews, now I am stuck with a game that gets stuck when you zoom in on anything. Can't even get a refund. Save your money for something else. Nice relaxing game, I enjoy cleaning up an item and making it like new. There are a few bugs along with one very annoying visual glitch on some completed items, but they do not take away my enjoyment of the game. This game could be so much better if it weren't for all the bugs, unfortunatley it seems to be abandoned by the devs

1861870,Shadow Fate,game,False,"5 Apr, 2022","Indie, RPG",A modernized turn-based epic adventure,"Can't remember why...but there must have been a reason why I asked for a refund. The most fun, polished, and well thought out rpg maker game I've ever played. Really fun and enjoyable game. Unlike a lot of games that are of this make and model, this one has a ton of skills where pretty much all of them have some use. You aren't stuck with 100 skills and spells but find that there is just 2 that you cast the entire game play.
 The depth, sophistication, and variety on display in Shadow Fate's combat system would be staggering for most JRPGs, let alone a one-man indie project. Had these mechanics been attached to a project that didn't quite hit the nail on the head in terms of story or pacing, said project would likely still be worth tolerating in order to enjoy some solid battlin'. Commendably, that‚Äôs not even remotely the case here. Even when considered independently of its standout combat mechanics, this really is a quality (keeping in mind the low-tech engine) indie release, deserving of high marks across the board. Less than a month removed from 2023, Shadow Fate remains in pole position for my 2022 game of the year. 

Structurally, SF provides a largely linear, high-on-forward-momentum style of adventure. You eventually gain the ability to zap back to previously visited areas, but the main plot is keen on getting the player to put one foot in front of the other, keeping you constantly on the move through new dungeons and towns. Both casual JRPG sightseers and completionists will, however, have plenty of reason to want to go back, as Shadow Fate is generous with its hidden treasures and clever about their locations. And, most notably, it diversifies playthroughs for all but the most hardcore of character loyalists by having certain things only be reachable if your 3-person party happens to contain whoever possesses the exploration ability that any given treasure happens to call for. 

Shadow Fate‚Äôs cast of 8 characters is a fun bunch of misfits. Even the ones that are clearly not the leading actors in the shadowplay feel like more than the sum of‚Ä¶ well, their lines‚ÄîI suppose‚Äîthanks to the meticulously designed synergy that develops between each character‚Äôs personality, fighting style, and exploration ability. There‚Äôs also an earnestness to their friendships and conflicts that just works for me. I'd say it's because their interactions often feel like they belong somewhere in the late PS1 era, leaning slightly closer toward the brisk and concise style of the SNES era than of the twenty-minute cutscene format that awaited in the PS2 era and (especially) beyond. Aside from what almost seem to be mandatory tone-lightening jokes (which are mostly character-appropriate, and obviously serve to keep tense, disastrous situations and intra-party conflict from spilling over into feeling outright oppressive to the player), cutscenes are usually quick to explain, resolve, reveal, progress, etc. whatever a given scenario needs, making for a rare (relatively) fast-paced page-turner experience in the genre, with major main plot developments and minor character side story reveals often progressing just a coupla textboxes apart from one another. These scenes are usually brought to the next level of quality by way of brilliant visual flourishes. The small character details and action animations add as much drama to scenes as additional dialogue would have, and lift the presentation above most of its similarly-styled contemporaries without hurting its solid pacing. 

Every playable character has their own cool-looking, often enemy-deleting limit break-type Super move‚Äîa mechanic that in many games would have been enough to call the battle system a job well done. Shadow Fate doesn't settle there, though. Not by a long shot. On top of having visually and mechanically distinct finishing maneuver, your allies all come fully loaded with bespoke skillsets that set every character apart from one another. Additionally, these already fairly flexible archetypes are able to‚Äîthrough equipment and in-combat use, Final Fantasy IX-style‚Äîaccrue additional skills and magic abilities. Most of them are universal, but even there, you have certain items that are character-specific, and further serve to develop the identity of each companion.
 
Shadow Fate also has an absurdly deep‚Äîand essentially optional‚Äîpreemptive system in place. Every companion again brings their own unique‚Äîand often game-changing‚Äîability to the table if you enter battle shrouded in darkness. Between being able to steal items, recover SP, gain temporary boons like making yourself impervious to critical hits or assuming a stance that makes you counter physical attacks, there's no shortage of ways with which to get an immediate edge in battles you see coming.

Oh, and some of these skills‚Äîincluding certain pre-emptive ones‚Äîallow you to activate them without using up your turn, with this Instant marker adding yet another layer of tactical complexity to the proceedings. 

... And let‚Äôs not forget about the icing on the cake: The fighting game-inspired EX system. Every character gains a bit of EX when doing certain character-specific things. A fully-charged EX meter then allows a character to unleash their Super--or limit break, if you will--but the meter itself comprises 4 bars of EX, with just 1 of those being all you need to enhance and transform many regular abilities into something more impactful, longer-lasting, element-specific, status-inflicting, etc. With about a dozen abilities per character, that‚Äôs well over 50 additional tricks to pull out of one‚Äôs sleeve in combat.

Also! My absolute favorite thing about battles might be the visual panache of not just the heroes, but especially the enemies. So many of the monster types have uniquely animated combat sequences, and they're often some combination of inventive and hilarious. And that's not even touching on the tons of different status effects, food items, etc. that also play a significant part in combat. 

Simply put, Shadow Fate's battle system has quite the amount of tricks up its sleeve. An utterly absurd amount. It didn't have to go this hard, really. Dang. But I'm glad it did. Although boss fights came to be slightly on the ""unfair final boss fight in fighting game that requires several gameovers"" side of things for me a bit earlier than I expect will be the case for most, I'm looking forward to starting over and doing better from the get-go in a future playthrough. You can tell from the amount of variety and polish that this is a passion project--and, in my view, it's an extremely triumphant one. Overall a good JRPG with good story and characters. The EX system makes the fights more dynamic and there are several ways to approach encounters. As I understand the creator of this game did everything from start to finish. This is very impressive as I'm in the process building a rpg myself and I can truly appreciate the hard work. I really enjoyed the game, it has some very unique ideas with the battle mechanics and there is a lot of attention to detail considering everything was made by a single person. I have to admit, I was sweating a bit in some of the fights and the puzzles are not that easy and I haven't even finished the game yet to start a harder difficulty. Well done, great work
 A well crafted game that has a few weakspots in the world building, but ultimately the characters, story and combat carry it through to be an amazing experience that will make you cry, and will make you laugh and will make you hopeful even in the darkest of fates. Highly recommend. 

Spawn likes pizza, most relatable protag fr fr Absolutely a blast! Characters are amazing, story is fun, gameplay is clean, combat is fun, and it's just a good time! ""Shadow Fate"" is one of the best JRPGs I've played in a long time. Among the ones made with RPG Maker VX Ace, it's my favorite one together with ""Forever Home"". If classic old-school JRPGs with turn-based combat are up your alley, you won't regret buying this massive adventure (40+ hours of playtime).

Story: Spawn, an embodiment of human sin, is summoned by the Vengeance Guild that ostensibly fights crime in the city of Atro. When Spawn learns about the Vengeance Guild leader Ysella's true goal (which is to summon Ioro, the Devourer, an entity beyond the mortal realm that prevents humans from reaching paradise), Spawn is forced to flee. Together with other party members that get involved, he must first fight to live another day, until the party is strong enough to thwart Ysella's and Ioro's ambitions. It's a well-executed save-the-world story with a few twists and many shades of gray. There are also implications about our wasteful lifestyle, and despite themes like ""human sin"", the game doesn't really enter the minefield of ""religion territory"". Furthermore, two well-executed love stories are central to the plot. To top it all off, the ending is emotional and immensely satisfying, and the many unexpected and competently foreshadowed secrets of the party members spice up things along the way. Only small demerits can be noted: A few MacGuffin hunts in the game's later half slightly impact the story flow, and the party only learns about Ysella's and Ioro's past through ""flashbacks"".

Characters: It's a lovable bunch. Spawn struggles with his (absence of) humanity in a way that makes him the most human of all characters. His teammates get involved involuntarily in the great quest, but they all have unique personalities and make great additions. Meet Wyatt, the caring gunman who didn't want to follow in the footsteps of his father (a famous bounty hunter); Terell, a bodyguard who struggles with heights and old age (both played for jokes); Rennie, a sassy farmer girl who gains the ability to change into different monster forms; Kye, a merchant with telekinetic powers; his sister Kendra, a psychic that loves (recorded) TV dramas and to steal shiny things; and, lastly, Sidalia, an assassin of the Vengeance Guild whose life and beliefs get turned upside down as the plot unfolds. The antagonists Ysella and Ioro are great, too, since they share a heartbreaking past.

The graphics are beautiful, a lot of resources are used to create stunning maps. In contrast to many other RPG Maker VX Ace games, ""Shadow Fate"" can be played in an expanded window mode.

Gameplay: The usual here: You explore dungeons and fight (mob/boss) monsters in turn-based (side-view) battles. Dungeons (like forests, plains, temples, ice, volcano, sewers) are well designed and offer lots of exploration incentives (many well hidden treasures) and a few (not really hard) puzzles. On most dungeon maps, the party members' field abilities can be utilized to obtain extra treasure, so it's a good idea to scour all maps using different party compositions (unfortunately, party members can only be switched out at inns, and you can't see a field skill map icon unless the character in question is in the active party). Spawn can use teleportation panels and cloak himself to give the party a first strike state when engaging in battle (monsters are visible/respawnable - no random encounters - and chase/ambush you when you approach them uncloaked). Wyatt can snipe a few distinct enemies to convert them into treasure chests, Terell can destroy obstacles, Rennie can reach far-away treasure chests, Kye can float nearby treasure chests and create bridges, Kendra can talk to the dead and remove spiritual obstacles, and Sidalia can charm or lure enemies for certain benefits. Fast travel is unlocked later, and a quest log details the party's objectives, which means the player doesn't have to do without modern amenities.

Battles are very complex, but a lot of fun, not only because of the great skill animations. The active party is composed of three members, and Spawn (if present) can't be switched out. Each character has a huge set of unique skills at their disposal, which means the player has always means to fight back. Spawn is a jack-of-all-trades neutral and elemental (especially shadow) damage dealer that can also be played as an evasion tank. Wyatt utilizes physical gun shots with elements attached and learns some really powerful support and damage skills later. Terell is mostly a classic tank, but can dish out a surprising amount of physical damage as well. Rennie is a party of her own, since each of her monster forms, between which you can switch freely, plays differently. Kye has a variety of unique ""merchant""/""sailor"" skills and is the only one who can fly and ground flying enemies. Kendra is a great healer/mage/disruptor and the only one who can steal items from enemies. Finally, Sidalia is another jack-of-all-trades, utilizing different stances related to different playstyles.

One important mechanic at play is the ""EX meter"" that fills by using certain skills or performing certain actions during battle. You can either wait until the ""EX meter"" is full to use a ""super"" skill, or you can use part of the meter to trigger the ""EX effect"" of one of your basic skills by pressing ""Esc"" shortly after the skill selection. Other factors to consider are the enemies' positions, the many status conditions that can be inflicted, the use of ""instant"" skills (that don't use up an action point), the reach of multi-target skills, and skill cooldowns and warmups. Also, some skills can only be used in the aforementioned first strike state during the first turn. Furthermore, while actions can't be freely distributed among party members (each party member has to use up their own action points, usually one per turn, but more when certain skills are used or conditions met), the order can be chosen freely (e.g. you can cure a silenced party member on the first position, enabling him/her to use a skill this turn). The battle system seems overwhelming at times, yet it's ""easy to learn, but hard to master"" at its best. By the way, all party members can and should be developed, not only because the final boss fights cleverly force you to use all of your party members. You're ""stuck"" with certain party members during particular segments, which means it's a good idea to become accustomed to their playstyles.

Adding to the complexity is a plethora of items, including specialized equipment pieces for nearly any situation, character-exclusive accessories and food items that provide decent (but mutually exclusive) buffs. Honestly, it seems a bit too much at times, and it's definitely possible to overcome all challenges by sticking to a few select equipment pieces, but I'd rather have too many than too few options. Many equipment pieces even have skills attached that can be learned by using the skill a certain number of times. Most of these skills are ""mere"" elemental ones, but they are great for exploiting enemies' elemental weaknesses.

Sadly, a lot of things can be permanently missed during the game's first hours, including the ability to earn certain achievements (later), so completionists should refer to the information provided on the Steam forum. In addition to offering a lot of side quests, the game ""challenges"" the player with different mini games, including three well designed ""seahorse racing"" tracks and a bowling mini-game, all of which can be completed even by players that are less proficient when it comes to action segments. While the game contained a few bugs at launch, the developer, who is very active and friendly, has fixed them astonishingly fast.

In conclusion, the game is everything I'd expect and hope to see in a modern retro-style (insert your favorite classic JRPG series). If every other game showed the amount of love and detail that has gone into ""Shadow Fate"", our gaming backlogs would be infinitely longer. I am still early in play-through. But man, loving the game so far! Brings me back to early 2D Final Fantasy games, with modern twist. Loving it!

Embark on a perilous road-trip across a Divided States of America. Use the power of words to shape relationships with your crew, get out of trouble and reach your final destination.","tl;dr: adventure game reminiscent of telltale games with occasional splices of ""gameplay"". the story concept has potential, but its delivery falls flat thanks to a combination of an unlikable, petulant cast; ham-fisted, browbeating rhetoric; and thinly-veiled, hypocritical discrimination. in short, the game breathes so deep of its own farts that i couldn't help but constantly wonder throughout my playthrough, whether the story was truly taking itself seriously or if it was an on-the-nose caricature of the message(s) it presented. overall, i'm most disappointed by the fact that my tax dollars went to funding this game, so really, i was robbed of both my time and my money.

in summary, the game is a demonstration of ""us good them bad"" tribalism: the main cast can do no wrong, and even if they do commit crimes, its perfectly fine because of the situation they had found themselves in (read: it was of their own making); ironically, an antagonist confronts them with this very argument, only to be swayed by the main character's convincing whataboutism. the dialogue itself, in every situation, is like reading the shower thoughts of a redditor with liberal ideology: every scene is a witty marvel one-liner comeback or an indisputable criticism that the enemy of the moment simply cannot fathom nor rebuke.

most notably are the characters, presented as a group of adults in around their 30s but act in ways (in both spoken language and body language) that make them seem more like modern (late-2010s, early-2020s) college students in their early 20s regurgitating liberal ideology without thinking for themselves, while playing into (unintentionally or otherwise) stereotypes appropriate for their backgrounds and their enemies consist of stereotypical pale-skinned ""cops,"" all of which (except for the one colored cop) spout and enact exaggerated anti-DEI ideologies. 

as for the main party:
- pax: a [strike]gypsy[/strike] romani blatantly oblivious to the damage she causes to the people and environments around her both normally and through her supernatural vocal commands. there is a single, small segment where she attempts to use said supernatural powers in a positive way, only to fail and never try again.
- sai: a plus-sized desi with vitiligo prone to moments of crippling anxiety, a caricature of the quirky, ""lol so randumb xD!!"" fangirl stereotype. has the power of what looks like temporarily turning parts of her skin to stone but only ever uses it to... break down doors and into buildings. the reveal in issue #10 should imply she's more competent than the aforementioned characteristics make her seem, but it is just a wasted moment instead.
- noam: a they/them brit from hong kong and ex-they/themfriend of pax. has the stereotypical strained relationship with they/their mother. playacts the idea of being refined and posh and comes off as garish and noveau riche. has the power to successfully gaslight people into any idea; it is a plus that the abuse of this power is called out, but its narrative impact is close to zero, as nothing changes in the story because of it nor are there consequences for the prior wrongs committed with this power.
- theo: mexican techbro with an occasional voice of reason moment, only to be silenced by the rest of the group (not limited to the previous three). its like his character is supposed to be the responsible adult of the group, but he's inevitably only treated as either the stick-up-his-ass bossman or the jokey, out-of-touch dad depending on not what archetype your choices have pushed him toward but what the story/situation needs him to be. ultimately, has no powers and no influence on the story but inevitably is the fall guy, being the butt of most jokes and taking ""responsibility"" for the group.
- ziggy: a vaguely east asian, knowledgeable in ""tech"" and ""sister by circumstance"" to pax. has either the power to phase through physicality or the power of super speed, depending on what the situation calls for. is a frog in a well, acting like a stereotypical, petulant teen honor student, but neither sees the world beyond the well nor the sky above it nor experiences the consequences for such shallow-mindedness
- robot: a literal robot bus driver, gains human-ish sentience (read: pronouns) and waxes philosophy. becomes sassy for no reason and without prompting.
- eli: a plainly african-american guy with the power of inducing schizophrenia through storytelling. somehow forms a love triangle between ziggy and ophelia, his childhood friend, so likely a thinly-veiled self-insert.
- girl: a literal child and a mute. the party worries they might be misgendering girl by naming girl such without verifying girl's gender and pronouns.
- sol: war veteran and brown-skinned peter dinklage. has the power to heal by reciting poetry. constantly reminds you of his experiences so you don't forget.
- ophelia: vaguely caucasian but ""not-white"" girl with autism. has the power to share the ""pain"" she feels to others.

thanks for coming to my TED talk. if i feel like complaining more, i might update this later. Great game! Its a punk indie comic featuring a queer and poc cast. Its good but not without issues. dialogue over laps a lot, combat is loose and there are places towards the end of the game where the scenery seem to not be textured properly but the moments where the game works it works really well, sitting around the campfire and making choices that influence who you and your friends are is great. whatever comes next for the devs will no doubt be worth checking out One of the few woke games with a soul.

wrote a review, and accidentally deleted it halfway through.
TL;DR version:
the story is political coded, but the main message is words are power.
thought was actually put into the lore of not-America
the worst part is the beginning of the game.
is this supposed to be game about unlikable protagonist or ""ULTRA WOKE X-MEN""?
the opposing factions are barely defined, unless you go looking for info.
justice - wants to use words for power and failed to re-write the universe
puritans - might want to censor the language or might want to do the same thing
the syndicate - want to learn about it
the AI/robots - come out of nowhere, but apparently want something with it too
Pax is too loosely defined.
the male protagonists dont take charge in social settings. I like that Eli was once with the big biker boss woman, but this seems to have been written for comedy.
Sai - is a developed char. she wears revealing clothing, dyed hair, piercings, they patched out her drinking scenes. is she a devout muslim? a jack muslim? or is she not?

ghost bustin, learning dragon shouts, proto-language writing the universe... all of these things could have been done better... or done less embarrassingly in the case of ""bustin' makes me feel good"".

our mute companion, Pax, and our unborn 'selves' are supposed to be proto-wunder-kin but your big real game play selling point ""Words have power"" is literally an after thought - AFTER we learn the group is on the run. AFTER we learn its a clandestine mission. AFTER we learn theres an underground syndicate. AFTER we make it out of California, which sounds like it's doing BETTER than the rest of the US. AFTER we break into our old neighborhood. an entire episode goes by before we learn ANYTHING about it.

and the endings, which BTW you'll need to min max certain interactions to get, are decided if each of the characters decide to fight a losing war, do nothing, or join the syndicate... THEO DIES! also Pax can tell someone she never met she may/may not be willing to give up her child. this could have been set up better. seeing as it would mean: one of their top researchers leaving, and Pax's own skill/knowledge/connections to the wreckonning being lost...
... but it just comes out of nowhere, like ""would you mind making your beloved child an orphan [or worse] for us pretty please"" - i'm surprised there wasn't an option to scream her into weeping on the spot.

i played pax as a noobie trying to be a hero and a good sister, and i played pax as a meanie ball buster. its far from the worst game, i liked parts of it. the tell-tale esque puzzles and easter eggs (tire dragging) were enjoyable. 

how is it that red thread - the people for the jorney beyond series (dual worlds magic vs future technology that spanned over a decade) are responsible for this alien road trip about lesbians vs the cops? whatever... trigger all the noobs you want, this story ends on a cliff hangar anyway... i expect this'll continue with Pax's kid, discovering THEY/THEIR mom's old friends and fixing the world epic mickey style... or merging with the alien hive squids and getting an answer to the universe's questions and become language-Jesus... dang i think i accidentally wrote a sequel where dustborn is actually a secret prequel to dragon-shouts' Deus Ex.

[edit]
oh yeah, the dialogue. you've heard more & worse opinions on this elsewhere. everyone talks like quippy tweens on twitter, or their all going out of their way to correct each other. everyone has the heir of ""you're not quite perfect in this thought of yours, let me correct you!"" which is needed sometimes, but not 90% of the whole game. how about a character just says ""I like this"" or ""I dont like this"" or ""i want to do X for Y"" and then everyone just agrees! or [advanced lesson now] We as the player make a choice, and there's a MIX of reactions to what we just did. Maybe... Eli makes a joke, N04m thinks its hot, Sai thinks it's cool but later says it scared her because she's sweet like that. Theo says you're acting childish, and Izzy is the one to try to correct you every 5 seconds. maybe you make a conversation piece of the political bits, instead of more buffy the vampire slayer dialogue... jeez... Okay I have never written a review for a game in my life. I REALLY wanted to like this game because the chuds and right wing knobs were piling on it for all the wrong reasons, so lets get this out of the way. 

Black Lives Matter
You can't be racist against white people.
Diversity is good, actually, and that includes video games. 

Okay, we have a baseline. 

I like the ideas of this game, but the execution is not good. The dialogue is not written well, the animation is lackluster even compared to telltale games which came out years ago, and the voice acting lacks a certain charm or sparkle. I love everything this game is going for in terms of diversity, LGBTQ+ representation, and political themes. I especially hate that it was the target of a hate campaign for all of those reasons and that makes me hesitant to give it a poor review. That being said, the implementation is just not there even as much as I wanted it to be. super fun and creative game! a little overwrought at times, but a great adventure. highly recommend! I liked the homage to the rhythm game era, like Rockband and DDR. I also like the nostalgia of the point and click games of the past and the retro mini games. The characters unexpectedly grew on me and the way the game handles camera movements is incredible. I love how you can frame different areas during most cut scenes. I like the choice system as well. I wasn't always on board with the plot and some of the political and social frameworks were extremely on the nose, but I felt like I wanted to stay on for the ride. The last couple of chapters did feel incredibly rushed, including Sai's storyline, which I wish was unpacked more. But the comic book style and plot twists were satisfying to watch. I liked it. Tl;DR - A very complicated game to pin down, but oh so worth your time. Pax and crew are gems that shine brighter and brighter as you rub at them.

~

Mechanically, Dustborn is a reasonably simple game.

Narratively, it is anything but.

The dialogue choice system is unintuitive, but in a way that makes you recognise that real people don't change personality or motivations sentence-to-sentence, and that acting in a way you think they'll like is not always reliable or won't always give the result you expect. You learn to appreciate it more and more as you go, especially how it fleshes out the characters, but you have to let it develop.

""You have to let it develop"" might as well be the tagline for this review. Dustborn gets better as you go. The companions, the narrative and myth arc, all of it (except maybe the combat, but that's skippable).

~

The main cast, especially the main character (Pax), do not start out likeable but go through serious character development. They're difficult people, and the game doesn't shy away from that, but also drives home the fact that it's important and worthwhile to get to know them better (you don't have to, you can play the MC as an uninterested prick the entire time, but the game will be lessened because of it).

~

One mechanical thing that this game does extremely elegantly is the collectables system. All three of the collectables, Echoes/scrap/gifts, ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING mechanically. Echoes allow you to boost your Vox powers, scrap allows you to upgrade your weapon, and gifts allow you to gain relationship points with your party members.

The elegance of it comes from how they handle it in game. Every time you collect an Echo, it sends out a small shockwave that disrupts the immediate surroundings, revealing either some scrap or a gift. This knock-on effect means that you'll be able to boost your weapon or social scores at the same time as you are unlocking new powers, which makes it much more satisfying to hunt down Echoes whenever you can.

As I said earlier - it's quite an elegant way to do it.

~

There are some bugs that will require you to restart your game (a boss fight where the boss runs off resulted in my Pax being stuck in place, and eventually having to skip the combat entirely) and there was an audio glitch that soured me on an unmentioned 'Dave' character later in the game, but the bugs can be circumvented and they're easily counted on one hand.

~

Overall, I greatly enjoyed Dustborn. The complexity is a positive once you get past the first couple of chapters, the character grow on you tremendously, and the myth arc is interesting. Wish Eli wasn't so obviously the developers' favourite, but that's a minor concern.

Not everyone is going to like it, but those who do will very much like it. It's absolutely worth a try. I‚Äôve just finished Dustborn and all I can say is: I love it! üòç

The story is simply fantastic ‚Äì emotional, gripping, and filled with amazing characters that truly grew on me. The dialogues are cleverly written, and the world feels alive.

The gameplay is great! The combination of exploration, dialogue choices, and intense combat scenes makes every moment special.

Visually, the game is a real treat. The comic style is beautiful and perfectly fits the atmosphere. The music and sound design enhance the experience even more, letting you fully immerse yourself in the world.

Yes, there are a few small flaws, but they are completely secondary to me.

I highly recommend Dustborn to anyone who loves well-told, deep stories and exciting gameplay. The game kept me hooked from start to finish and will stay in my memory for a long time. I grew up in the 90/00s playing Point and Click adventure games; this game should be understood in that lineage. This is a really interesting, story heavy game that incorporates some fun and novel (for adventure games) mechanics. Some shout-outs to TLJ and Dreamfall and a similar vibe with some of the mystical elements. The alternate future story is really interesting and keeps you wanting to hear more of the story.

1249800,Xuan-Yuan Sword VII,game,False,"28 Oct, 2020","Action, Adventure, RPG","Xuan-Yuan Sword VII is an ARPG rooted in Chinese history and mythology. Players take on the role of Taishi Zhao, a calm and reliable swordsman who was accidentally involved in a tragic fate. To protect his beloved family, he starts a journey in this chaotic realm to find the truth.","I really enjoyed Xuan Yuan 7. This was my first game in the Xuan Yuan franchise.

I am a huge fan of linear action games like Devil May Cry and Ninja Gaiden. While Xuan Yuan 7's combat is no where near as fluid as Ninja Gaiden and has no where near the combo potential of Devil May Cry, it still felt more like an action game than an RPG to me. Yes there are RPG mechanics like character leveling via experience points, but your stats don't scale as high as in most RPGs so in the end this game rewards skilled gameplay more than any of it's RPG mechanics. I played Xuan Yuan 7 on ""Nightmare"" (hardest) difficulty; if I had played on an easier difficulty I probably would have found it too easy to enjoy.

The combat is entirely melee focused. Your main character does not have a ranged weapon or spell. You have a basic attack combo, a dodge that give you brief i-frames, a block that can trigger a parry if you time it just before an enemy hit, a camera lock-on, a finisher move when an enemy's posture is broken, a manually triggered time slowdown, and you choose 2 (out of 7) stances that provide unique heavy attacks and special attacks. You can also trigger your 2 AI allies to perform a special attack. Not the deepest combat system, but enough for you to tinker to keep your entire first playthough feeling fresh.

I do want to warn you that there is a healthy dose of jank here. Boss patterns, hit boxes, the camera, and physics can all give you a headache. Some animations can be canceled and some cannot. Some attacks will give you I-frames againts certain enemy attacks, but not give you I-frames against other enemy attacks. If you are the type of gamer that wants games to be extremely intuitive, then you may not enjoy Xuan Yuan 7.

I really enjoyed the story. This is not a typical JRPG story line where you end up killing God. This is a smaller scale story about a brother trying to take care of his sister.

Quick Positives:
[list]
    [*]Linear With Waypoint. You will not get lost. :)
    [*]Skippable Cutscenes (although I genuinely enjoyed the story and didn't skip them usually)
    [*]Multiple Save slots (like 15ish)
    [*]New Game+
    [*]The game performed well on my hardware.
    [*]Controller support worked great. (I played using an X Box controller)
    [*]The music was very pleasant. I don't think I will listen to the soundtrack much outside the game, but it works well in this game.
    [*]Aside from some puzzles, I thought the game had really good pacing and didn't overstay it's welcome.
[/list]

Quick Negatives:
[list]
    [*]The loading screens can get annoying. The game will give you a loading screen after every death, including if you retry a boss fight.
    [*]Numerous slow sections like climbing, crawling, shimmy-ing, etc. This game also suffers from ""yellow paint syndrome"" but it is white paint in this case.
    [*]Puzzles. There are a handful of puzzles and I think the game would have been better without them personally.
    [*]Fast travel can only be done between fast travel points. I would have prefered being able to just fast travel from the pause menu to avoid backtracking.
    [*]The side quests are pretty forgettable such as a tic-tac-toe style board game.
    [*]The camera can be very frustrating and cause you to die because you can't see.
    [*]I did experience a few crashes when I alt+tab-ed to access other apps on my PC. This only occured about ~5% of the time, but still worth noting. The game never crashed while it was the focused app on my PC. I only experienced crashes after alt-tab. I experienced crashes on both the Windowed and Fullscreen settings.
    [*]Unless I missed it, you cannot pause cutscenes and you cannot pause during certain animations like shimy-ing along a ledge.
[/list] Love the wuxia aesthetic here. Would recommend if you can overlook janky combat and barebone story. This might be a 6/10 game but I'm definitely interested in whatever this devs make in the future. Good action RPG.  Wish it was English Dubbed. It kind of upsets me that a lot of people don't like this game. Maybe it's so much more focused on the story than the gameplay that it turns people off.

I love this game so much that I went out of my way to buy the exclusive physical edition. I truly believe that if someone took the time out to play this and went in seeing it more as an interactive movie than a regular game, they would enjoy it so much more. Only reason to play a game like this is for the story. Unfortunately, the story fell flat.

I never cared for the main character and his motivation seems very tangential to the plot. Everything seems thrown together with barely any explanation, even the final boss, which just shows up and has no build up. worst puzzles I ever saw Rich story line with plenty of lore.  Recommend this for a quick run through.  There's a nightmare mode if folks want to challenge their skills.  Nice music and fleshed out characters. Surprisingly good game, fair amount of jank, but was enjoyable until the end. The combat would be better if the enemies were better designed, but it's serviceable. 

7.5/10 If you have played Xuan-Yuan Sword II Dance of maple leaves and Xuan-Yuan Sword IV, then this game is a must play. It completes the stories of the above two games. Otherwise, the game does not worth your time.

Pros: the graphics and the music immerse you in an ancient Chinese world
Cons: the story is too short, and very limited interactions with NPCs Disappointing story....gameplay is a hit and miss...the only thing good is some of the graphic scenery are really good.",0.08233355452333545

1300310,Move Code Lines,game,False,"28 Aug, 2020",Indie,"Move Code Lines is a game where you fix programs and make them print needed output. But the only way you can achieve that is to change the order of lines in those programs, and set custom input.","THIS IS NOT PYTHON
THIS IS NOT JS / JAVASCRIPT
THIS IS A BESPOKE LANGUAGE
(it would be nice if the author specified this in the description)

Took me slightly over 8 hours to solve chapters 1-12 (maybe i'll come back to this review and update it when i solve chapter 13)

The idea is charmingly simple: you move code lines --- and also provide input, so the title isn't really totally honest maybe.

It's a puzzle that starts out extremely simple and the first few chapters can be used to learn programming, though the later ones are more of a puzzle, and you might even want to write some helper code somewhere else to nail down the exact inputs. Some levels can be done with a bit of guessing and trial and error, though you still have to get the basic idea

There are a couple peculiarities:
- The language used is something the author has made from scratch, with heavy inspiration from JS, Python, and possibly a couple others like Go or Java
- The language always uses pass-by-reference, which is a bit unusual and can throw someone off. It would be nice if passing by reference would be more explicit, even though it would make a couple easy levels slightly easier
- There is no introspection of variables during execution --- kind of a shame really, since if you try using it to teach or learn, it would be really helpful to have some visual feedback when variables change.
- There is no way to save your solutions, barring taking a screenshot and saving it somewhere else. Really frustrating when you get to the later chapters.
- No way to reset your progress. I guess the idea is to just buy another copy on another account, which is more of an inconvenience, since the price is certainly not an issue

All in all, this is a nice programming puzzle, not too simple, not too challenging. Getting all achievements seems to be possible within like 20 hours, although i haven't done so myself yet so soooo underrated. a truly nice game for code learning Great for practicing! I enjoy that this is helping me learn a bit about coding. However, I do wish that it included some tutorials. I'm kinda just winging it. It would be good as a supplement for someone who is learning code through a course. I'm almost a complete beginner, so there's a lot I'm not entirely sure of. It is a bit like a fun puzzle though. Very good coding exercises for who is learning Python. This game is fun in the first levels, but without any debugging and explanation, it is just trial and error. It stops becoming fun relatively fast and I just finished it for the Achievements. 

Idk, maybe the Dev thought it'd be a fun game, but it is just too random and complicated. I did not enjoy the game, because there is no way of really learning. You either know or you don't. Whenever you have a mistake it just says ""ERROR"" which is really not helpful for a puzzle-game. fun game nice game, train coding logic, and is very applicable generally speaking I'm not a programmer, but I have dabbled in it a bit. I don't know what it'll be like for someone with no prior experience in programming, as you'd also have to gain an understanding of the programming-lingo/logic-concept. I'd also imagine this is boring and a bit silly for a seasoned programmer, but as someone identifying as the target demographic; it's a puzzle game with a programming theme. I'm only a couple dozens of levels in so I cannot speak for the later stages, but so far so good. Great little game for learning basics of coding. I've seen a few other coding games but they had little to no interactivity, this does. Its kinda like a puzzle game, but certain pieces go in specific places. Understanding that and some basic math and a little critical thinking, you can progress forward without much difficulty. It starts out easy but gets progressively more challenging. As someone who's trying to learn Python I found this game fun & informative.",0.09497068903318903

The story is fun, but the romance is non existent, there's just no chemistry between Heejung and her love interests. (I still need to do the wizards route so we will see after that). The game mechanics aren't anything amazing, and the game shows its age. I love the interactions, and the fact that the mc herself has mental problems that she struggles with but still comes on top of all of this. But as I said, romance is non existent, there's just no chemistry, but the interactions between the love interests is very funny and interesting.

I'M SORRY
I'M SORRY Thank you for the tinnitus Quick warning before getting to my review - please check the Mature Content description on this game, if you're not in the best head space I'd maybe wishlist this and come back later to play it.

OK/NORMAL doesn't really have much of a story-line that I can reasonably pick up on, but it's interesting and frustrating at the same time. There's a lot of things I like about this game and don't like about this game. For how short and cheap it is though, I'd say it's worth it.

Pros:
‚Ä¢ VERY neat graphics
‚Ä¢ I like the approach it had with [spoiler]it reading my computer's name and time to include it as part of the game[/spoiler]
‚Ä¢ Love the lil cloud dude, homie's chill and has [i]the best intentions[/i]
‚Ä¢ Most of the levels are fairly easy to navigate and get through

Cons:
‚Ä¢ I'm not a fan of the camera angles+control handling, ESPECIALLY on that god awful platforming level
‚Ä¢ Sometimes it was very unclear what your goal was or where to go so you'd just endlessly roam around, which got boring after a while [spoiler]and this was especially a problem in the key and final area with the spikey eye boys..[/spoiler]
‚Ä¢ Ending was a tad underwhelming, but I do like the twist it gives you to some degree
‚Ä¢ Too short, but I understand it did describe itself as a short game (this isn't an issue the dev did, I just wish it had more content, just feels like something was missing to really seal the deal.

Overall, for $3 - this is a game I can kind of recommend. If it even looks somewhat interesting to you - get it! It's a neat little game. I just really think there's more it could've done overall. 

[i]As a side note, there's only 4 achievements - if you're someone who cares about or really likes to achievement hunt till completion on a game, then do yourself a favor and look through the steam guides on it because you'll likely miss one like I sadly did and had to repeat most of the game again! I usually don't like to use guides whatsoever, but this one unfortunately needed one for my play-through personally.

Lots of non-recommended because of gameplay/storyline. The game's 40 minutes, quit your [strike]BIT[/strike]--whining. I wasn't thrilled myself, but if you're trying to emulate how a person on some rather wacky pills might feel, then making the controls, visuals, and audio the same way as they listen, look at, and interact with the environment is the way to go.

3404410,The New Apartment,game,False,"31 Jan, 2025","Action, Adventure, Indie",A man living in his new apartment finds himself in the center of something much more sinister.,"Very short decent horror game. [b]You've already played The New Apartment.[/b] That right there is its biggest setback. If you have even the [i]slightest[/i] interest in horror and have played [i]even just[/i] [b]one[/b] of those little indie horror games you find everywhere on Steam, then you know [b]EXACTLY[/b] what's going to happen, [b]beat by beat[/b]. That's not to say there isn't anything good in the game, nor am I saying that there aren't other issues worth talking about. [i]Look....[/i] all I'm trying to say is [i]that I've played these games before[/i]. you hear me?


The game begins [b]as any proper horror game should start[/b], by introducing us to a single, 20s something dude who [i]hates his job[/i], is buried [i]in student loans[/i], and [i]can only afford the cheapest and crappiest on the housing market[/i]. how else would you relate to your target audience? [b]he's literally me![/b] (*ahem*) so our hero man (I'm just going to call him Larry), just got home from work, and is doing his usual nightly routine. Eating dinner, washing dishes, brushing teeth, [i]all that exciting stuff[/i]; when all of a sudden, [i]he hears a strange noise in the living room[/i]. [b]w h a t   c o u l d   i t   b e ? ?[/b] Upon entering, he finds one of the framed photos on the ground, and on the wall in its place are the words [b]‚ÄúIn the darkness, you will find us‚Äù[/b]. huh.... whelp, it's awfully late, and I ought to be getting to bed now. [b]G'night[/b].


The first thing you'll notice about [b]The New Apartment[/b] is that [i]there really isn't any actual gameplay[/i]. You're going around your house, just... [b]living[/b]. Wash the dishes. [b]check[/b]. Brush your teeth. [b]check[/b]. Now [i]turn on your little night light and grab your teddy and say nighty night[/i]. [b]check-a-doodle[/b]. That's about as involved as the game gets, and we haven't even gotten to the horror yet. Once the lights go out and the spooky stuff starts, you're tasked with mindlessly moving around the apartment, searching for whatever weird occurrence just happened. There [i]is[/i] a puzzle in the last fourth of the game or so, but other than that, it's a [b]straight up walking simulator, with nowhere to even walk[/b]. And [i]don't get me wrong[/i], moving around in the dark [i]can[/i] be pretty unnerving, but as the game drags on, [spoiler]combined with the fact that you're in absolutely no danger for 99% of the runtime[/spoiler], the only feeling you'll have is [b]boredom[/b].


The production values of [b]The New Apartment[/b] are an equally mixed bag. Visually, the game actually looks really sharp, with hyper-realistic props and textures. I wouldn't be at all surprised if over half the assets came pre-made from Unreal Engine, but [i]hey[/i], it still looks great, and there are enough little details to prove that the developer really cared [spoiler](some of the book titles on the shelf are hilarious. our man Larry has both Politics for Winners AND Politics for Losers. ...I'm sure that joke offended someone somewhere)[/spoiler]. And the sound design is [b]fantastic[/b]; being both distinct and unsettling, without just going down the typical [b]L0Ud NOiSES!! ! ![/b] route. Unfortunately, the game runs like [b]crap[/b], with the FPS frequently dipping down [i]into the 10s[/i], with the motion blur (which you can't turn off) [b]making me want to puke[/b]. (I don't know my exact computer assessments, but I could run Apex Legends just fine at 60). It's also kind of difficult figuring out what items you can and can't interact with, because the icon is [b]so darn small[/b] and the camera makes me feel like I'm drunk anyway. And Larry's comments throughout the whole game just scream ‚Äú[b]I'm a modern horror movie protagonist with no personality[/b]‚Äù. like, [i]can we[/i] PLEASE stop the trope where [i]horror movie characters do stupid things because they're like[/i] ‚Äú[b]heh heh, I'm not in a horror movie or anything! I have so much to live for!![/b]‚Äù? It's not [b]funny[/b], it's not [b]clever[/b], and it feels like [i]you're making an excuse for[/i] [b]bad writing[/b]. And it's not like the rest of Larry's comments are any better: [b]‚Äúwell, that just happened!‚Äù, ‚ÄúI take a dump here every day‚Äù[/b], [spoiler]‚Äúmacaroni. good.‚Äù.[/spoiler]


And now, for the main thing that turned me off about [b]The New Apartment[/b], the [i]very thing that made me decide on the negative rating[/i], [b]we have the ending[/b]..............spoilers, [i]obviously[/i]. After you solve the riddle and open the combination lock, you open up the jewelry box and find a note that simply states ‚Äú[b]It is time. You are worthy. She is coming[/b]‚Äù. Almost [i]immediately[/i], your front door swings open, and the wind becomes unnaturally [b]loud[/b]. The game prompts you to hide in the bathroom, [i]which you do[/i].

It had some good horror aspects and was pretty smooth, however it was a bit difficult not exactly having any objectives. Could be a lot better if there was more direction and story. Nice short game, fair price. Loved how sarcastic the main character is, found that funny. If you want quick grab for your horror fix, grab this one. Full gameplay below üëá 
https://youtu.be/448hv8qelC0?si=hLP156t74ODOOA1y This game is awesome!
It makes you feel that something will come for you or jumpscare you,while you are walking through the rooms!
It has an amazing spooky atmosphere and amazing short spooky story!
For the price is for sure worth it!
Personally,I loved the game & I'm waiting for more!

Here is my gameplay if you need to watch it!

A cheap indie game made by a single developer. Very short, but the message was clear and effective. Enjoyed the atmosphere. This was alright. Nice and short but enough story to be somewhat interesting. I liked it. Good free game. It's short, but it is free so, no complaints. Good if you like short point and click story games. 6/10 Extremely short, very likely a game made for a two-week jam or something like that, but now free and fine enough for a solo developer. Biggest problem: it has many endings, but you can't skip the (very slow) dialog before changing your choice to see the other endings. Second biggest: audio changes wildly; be ready to turn it down. In any case, if you are in the mood for a very short, slightly horror, a bit unpolished, walking sim game, then this is for you. It has a couple of jump scares, but they are super predictable, so you shouldn't have a problem with those, even if you tend to avoid them. It's a fairly decent short indie horror. The horror elements were fun and it had a decent story. If the game was longer I would say it could have a strong story.  It would have also been nice to have more puzzle elements since it was all very straight forward. It was a cute , short, and sweet indie game. Interesting little free indie adventure/horror game, worth 20 minutes of your time, parabens Ricardo! Despite a few flaws, I still recommend this game. There's clearly a lot of work invested. The dev clearly has a great eye for lighting and atmosphere. Good pacing, a few moments will make your heart race without real jump scares. This game is very brief and in my mind shows the tremendous potential of the dev.",0.1282719069362905

201810,Wolfenstein: The New Order,game,False,"19 May, 2014",Action,"Wolfenstein¬Æ: The New Order reignites the series that created the first-person shooter genre. Wolfenstein offers a deep game narrative packed with action, adventure and first-person combat.","How do you revive a franchise? Well, a little like this. 

The New Order reboots the Wolfenstein franchise. If Doom was the granddad of the FPS genre, then Wolfenstein was the dinosaurs. The original premise was simple: you are BJ Blazkowicz, a prisoner of castle Wolfenstein during WW2. Escape the castle and kill as many Nazis as dare get in your way. Yeah, it's not much of a plot. New Order understands the assignment it's taking on perfectly however. 

It's 1946. The war is still on and the Nazis are winning. Blazko and the allies make one last desperate strike that goes all manners of sideways, leaving our hero in a coma and the Nazis free to take over the world. Fast forward to 1960 and Blazko wakes up and wastes zero time to get back into the fight. If Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds was a videogame it'd be a little like this. And Machine Games saw the comparison during development. Cutscenes have a wonderfully Tarantino styled edge to them. Add in a dark industrial soundtrack from Mick Gordon and presentation is solid. 

And how do you fight the Nazis? Well, however you like really. The game loves to drop you into sandboxes. Enemies will be present, patrolling, doing random tasks, conversing. And you're free to go about eliminating them however you please. Stealthily bypass the guards to eliminate their commanders and avoid having to deal with reinforcements? You can do that with some rudimentary, but serviceable stealth mechanics. Not one for sneaking? Grab your gun. Grab two guns even and go to town! Dual wielding is a thing and it is glorious to turn enemies into red smears on the wall by emptying two shotguns into them. And the game rewards you for your efforts. Perks unlock as you progress. Each kill makes you better at killing. 

Now for the not so great: this game released at the very end of the PS3/360 era and runs on the ID Tech 5 engine. It will look beautiful from the right angle, but only from that angle. pre-rendered cutscenes are a little low resolution, shadows are a little pixelated and PC features that are considered basic like anti-aliasing are absent. These are all issues that Machine Games would resolve with later entries in the series, just not here. Either way, don't let these gripes dissuade you. The New Order is still an amazing shooter that doesn't overstay its welcome and will take you along for a fun ride. its good Probably the best FPS ever made, a must play for any fan of the genre, however the ID tweaker file is reccomended for newer graphics cards on pc :) üè≥Ô∏è pretty good, those fuckin heavy shotgun soldiers are THE HARDEST enemy in the game

7/10 This game is very pog. I think shooting N@zis is a pog time.

2480650,ËÇùË©¶„Åó„Ç¥„É´„Éï[KimodameshiGolf],game,False,"29 Sep, 2023","Indie, Sports, Early Access",Kimodameshi Golf is a horror golf game based on golf!,"Very scary game! I would recommend to those who love golf and I would recommend to those who love the occult. I am very excited to see where the game goes next as it is developed. Thank you! I'll leave this as a tentative review, but I cannot recommend Kimodameshi Golf at this time.

This ultimately feels like it was not play tested, rather than given careful consideration to release. The idea is simple, play golf in haunted environments. And from there, everything goes downhill. I'll break things down to positives and negatives below:

Positives:
[list]
    [*] The game's concept is definitely original, given that I've never seen a horror themed golf game.
[/list]

Negatives (oh boy, here we go):
[list]
    [*] [b] Aiming your shots is broken, nearly impossible in some cases. [/b] The player is able to maneuver around the ball to initiate their shot, but the angle of approach to the ball determines where you can aim it during the shot. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but the angle at which the player model attaches to the ball is EXTREMELY inconsistent, and at times, impossible due to the player colliding with or getting on top of environmental details (for example, the first course in the playground, you'd end up on a bench when trying to shoot).
    [*] [b] The interruptions from the ghosts. [/b] So there's a ghost that looks like the stereotypical Japanese female ghost from any form of media that tries to hit your ball as you're aiming your shots. The big issue here is that the ghost doesn't need to aim and has FAR TOO SHORT of a cooldown on when it hits your ball. This means if you get cornered by this thing, you can basically kiss a perfectly aligned shot goodbye, and it is beyond frustrating to have this happen. 
    [*] [b] The mini-map. [/b] As if aiming wasn't bad enough, the minimap is completely useless. Even in the most basic games, you'd assume that the shot direction or player facing direction would be legible on the mini-map. Well my friend, you'd be incorrect. Not only is the direction issue a huge hurdle, but the areas that are technically out of bounds (which incurs a penalty like regular golf, but also sends a ghost to kill you when triggered) are not represented in any way on the mini-map outside of ""being out of the square you're looking at"".
    [*] [b] Physics. [/b] If you're looking at this review, you know what a golf game should feel like. You've played Mario Golf, Hot Shots, Easy Come Easy Golf, whatever. This game takes those rules and tosses them out the window. One of the maps forces you to golf inside of a house, but strangely, the wall seem to be made of some ball-attracting material, meaning if you make the mistake of whangin' it against the wall, it's going to get stuck. The main issue here is that, in this map, the main ""ghost"" cannot be contacted, otherwise it kills you. This pretty much means there's no way to complete this course if this happens.
[/list]

I'm only popping this review in solely to give other folks an expectation of what this game feels like at this time. The dev clearly states that this is a super early version of the build, but honestly, it should not have been published as it is. I avoided watching Critikal play this because I was legitimately excited to give it a shot, but I ended up walking away feeling haunted by the game in the complete wrong way.

2305760,‰∫∫ÈñìÁâßÂ†¥ Residence,game,False,"21 Jul, 2023",Casual,Kailin does her yoga training every day to stay fit for her upcoming sexfights. However today Yanmei took a place on Kailin‚Äôs spot‚Ä¶.and it was a mistake. Girls start to argue who is the best here and whose body is more fit.,"6/10 How to win the game asap in this knockoff of a street fighter.
I got this game so I can defeat the characters and see why the other 2 people gave up on it.

After button mashing on the keyboard I understand what each key means.
Controls: w,a,s,d is respectably up, left, down, right.
Controls: T, Y, U is respectably light punch, medium punch, and heavy punch
Controls: G, H, J is the same order but for kicks.

I've never played street fighter 1 but the way the button mashing works it reminds me of some broken combos in there like the infamous Ryu spam down kick.

To win as fast as possible: spam anything that gives you range or do down kicks. Also find the bugs in the game since it was made so poorly.

I'll give each spamable main attack per character you should try to do and the rest of their kit is just button mashing:
-Kailin is Ryu so spam the S and H buttons for the down kick.
-Yanmei has a cool projectile of a support kick. The AI doesn't know how to counter it and it's the best way to spam and stay healthy. When the P meter is full spam G and H together if you're next to the opponent for a P meter ultimate. Her normal atacks are only heavy attacks or medium heavy punches. Don't do the kicks on her since there is no inputs for them.
-Riko is Chun Lee. Main attacks are kicks. Punches are pointless. There is a good bug on Riko if you mash good enough and do the down medium heavy kick you can make the hitbotx stuck under her. Spam it to win. Basically Ryu 2.0.
-Jin-Ae is literally Ken. Spam his up heavy punch for a uppercut hit and spam it. It has 2 hits in it and is one of the fastest heavy punches in the game. Spam it to victory.
-Xiaooye spam her light, medium and heavy punches. The kicks are pointless on her, except her medium heavy kick. If you can get close enough and spam the light punches the AI doesn't know what to do and becomes stupid and usually gets locked in stuns.

All in all for a $3.99 game. It's a ripoff and bad game. For the pictures though? Idk. I played this game for a total no more than an hour to full completion. The AI because it knows the combos correctly is more of a player than any of us will ever be. So by becoming the machine and spam the right buttons you can beat the ""player Ai"". If anything else I only recommend it for the pictures but anything else game play was terrible. After the fact I think the pictures are AI generated too.
 [i][b]‰∫∫ÈñìÁâßÂ†¥ Residence[/b], really makes you work for those images, let me tell ya.[/i]

There was absolutely no way I was going to be able to fight with those keyboard inputs. You can't move left or right with the arrow buttons, only WSAD, which isn't the problem. The problem are the combat moves being Y, U, G, H and some others. I don't know, it's weird putting my fingers on the appropriate keys.

And there was a delay between the attacks you're doing which doesn't help.

The gallery images are great. The combat? Not so much.

554560,Amaranthine Voyage: The Tree of Life Collector's Edition,game,False,"14 Nov, 2016","Adventure, Casual","After finding an artifact, you're whisked away to a dying world. Can you save it from the darkness?","excellent This 1st entry in the series is an instant classic and I highly recommend it to fans of the genre. It would appeal most to those who are up for a bit of a challenge.

The story won't wow you, but it's a fun game packed with a lot of content, all of which is original and logical. It features lots of good hidden-object scenes, quite a few puzzles (some of which are quite clever), and delightful full-motion video of characters. The point-and-click adventuring is on the more difficult side, with very little hand-holding, but there's an in-game guide as well as hints if you get stuck. Unfortunately there's no fast travel, so you will have to backtrack quite a bit.

One thing to note is that this is a bit of an older game, so the resolution is quite low. The default aspect ratio might also be wrong (I had to enable ""aspect correction"" in settings). But despite the low fidelity the drawings are clear and pretty.

Also note that there are in-game achievements, but they are not linked to Steam. This game has average quality and I miss here proper story. I quite like map because it's showing places where the player need to do something. Graphic, bonus chapter and gameplay have very good quality.

[i] Overall I enjoyed playing this game.	[/i] This is one of those HO games that tries to be great, but falls flat on its face.  You are an archeologist  who is sucked into an alternate world by an artifact.  Evil has taken over this world and you are its saviour.
The graphics were pretty inconsistent.  Major scenes were beautifully done, but the HO scenes were very bland and flat.  Puzzles were very easy as were HO scenes.  There is a map, but no fast travel, so there is quite a bit of backtracking.
There are clips of the dying city's downfall, but the plot didn't excite me.  Voice acting was wooden, music was ok.
There are collectables  which are blimps and butterflies...very easy to find.  I didn't need an walkthrough for any of this game which shows you how easy it is.
Graphics and story in the bonus chapter was very well done.  This was the best part of the game which carried on from the main story.  Not a bad HO game, just very easy and mediocre.  Hope the rest of the series is an improvement.  Buy this on sale.  6.5/10 [h1]Short version: 60%[/h1]
Amaranthine Voyage looks good for its age, but otherwise it is a rather forgettable hidden object game of average quality.

[h1]Long version:[/h1]
Amaranthine Voyage 1: Tree of Life may be the first of a long series of hidden object games, but that series definitely had a humble start: while the game has no weaknesses in any design aspect, beyond its great graphics it also lacks any kinds of qualities that would make it stand out.

Like with most mediocre HOGs, the core issue is the lack of a proper story; we just run around in a ruined and abandoned jungle city, looking for items to unlock even more items, puzzles, or hidden object scenes. We learn a bit about the city‚Äôs downfall through some visions, but even that is unremarkably similar to most any generic HOG plots.

The biggest reason this game gets an upvote is the large amount of nice hidden object scenes. The puzzles are also okay, but the adventure game bits are a bit tedious, as the map does not allow fast travel, so most of the gametime is backtracking.
Overall, it is a decent HOG, but you can find many much better ones.",0.092702892985151
3374950,Stronghold: Caverns of Sorcery,game,False,"30 Jan, 2025",RPG,"Deep beneath the earth, the dragon is rising! Quest into ancient caverns, learn magical lore, and draw strength from friends and family to save your home! A text-based interactive fantasy novel.","Looking for a character driven story? Well despite the beginning where you're introduced to an established friend group and the numerous relationship stats bogging down the stat page, this is not it. Sometimes it even feels like the game forgets the side characters exist! You have no meaningful interactions with them outside of designated spots in the story that stops the plot progression to the point it feels like you have be removed from it entirely just to talk to the characters. They don't interact with the plot elements in any meaningful way. They don't comment on the events in any meaningful way or share insight. How does the story affect them? No idea! Fox will tell you how they like fungi though! How does this get represented in the story itself? It doesn't!

You don't get group interactions. While in the story itself you may get one or two lines of dialogue from the characters per point in they story, they don't make me feel any sort of way about them. They just sort of... happen? Like I thought I was going to get a story about a friend group that is shaped and or affected by the events of the story in some way, but there are no characters arcs for the side characters outside of romancing them (or in whatever other ways you can choose to pursue a relationship with them). And because the romance scenes also can't appear within the plot outside of revealing your relationship with the other characters (which doesn't feel like it leaves any impact so what's the point?), you get two or three romances scenes with your chosen RO and that's it. Your relationship does not exist to the plot (did I mention you have to be taken out of the plot to interact with the characters?)

There are at least 6 characters that can join you on your journey but you are the one doing everything by the way. The start of the story has the characters working together to help you but like, that's as far as the co-op goes. The story kind of just tells you they fight with you or something, but you don't get to see it. And when it does get mentioned, it feels like a throwaway line as if the author legitimately did forget the other characters are also there. 

What does the term Sorcerer mean in the context of this story? Read the entire thing and couldn't tell you. There might be a definition hidden somewhere but within the context of the story? Despite you being a Sorcerer seeming to define your relationship with your relative, the concept itself doesn't really get explored. I literally can't say if Sorcerers are purely magical, or are also just regular people who like studying and the subjects they study just so happen to be magical in nature. There is no exploration on what being a Sorcerer means to the other characters and their identity. Zoe is the only other character I can think of that uses magic. I think the group preforms a spell together at the start of the story but after that, Fox and Corbin don't really do anything magical. (Actually I think Zoe is only the only that may express a yearning to succeed but it happens in one of those scenes where a problem gets prompted to you and you resolve it in one conversation, never to be brought up again).

I don't even know why Corbin is there and I romanced the guy. He's a hunter that also weaves and has an issues with people encroaching on his idea of freedom, but other than that, I don't even think he's a sorcerer. He talks about leaving the tower some day, but like, why did he choose to live there to being with??? In fact, the guy tries to be the reliable sort, but there are 2-3 instances in the story where it tells you he can't do much. You, on the other hand, can pray and get things done - no magic required! 

What role DO the gods play in everyday life? Hard to say. MC seems to be the only character that interacts with them. The other characters don't mention them except for maybe Corbin that one time the idea of building an alter pops up (and you can actively choose to not have the alter be dedicated to a god???). You can choose to have the festival at the end of they story be dedicated to them. But you can just as easily have it be about you or the dragon.

How much impact DOES the waking dragon have on the story? You can remove it and nothing changes except maybe the very end. In fact, if the story was literally just about you finding caverns in a mountain after a spell misfires and you and your friends decide to explore it for the sake the scientific and/or magical advancement, I feel like the other elements in the story would've had roomed to breathe. This story could have literally just been about you either damaging or strengthening the relationships with the goblins, and balancing the issue between the spiders and the Dryads, and it would have been fine! In fact, the story could have placed the groups conflicting ideas (what little there is) in the forefront. 

In your first exploration, you can choose to repair the ecosystem or do research. Having similar scenes sprinkled through out and further exploring what's more important to the characters, and actually have the characters care, would have done some good! (If you fail to clean the ecosystem, you kind of get this weird, ""well we tried, onward and forward"" attitude from the group that didn't really get me invested in their thoughts or opinions - what hint of them there are - in the least). In fact, how your choices are presented to you kind of feels like you're aligning yourself with the a character for the sake of relationships points, and no further conversation into your choices is had. 

If I'm really being honest, I wanted more from them when it came to the goblins. I wanted them to have an opinion on forming ties and establishing camps. I wanted to see those opinions grow and change! As it stands now, you say jump, they jump. If you want relations with the goblins they're kind of sort of begrudging about it, and aren't very trustful of,them but it's barely there and you can literally ignore they're feelings on the matter with no consequence. You don't even really see them interact with the goblins all that much. Not a single ""You were right, I was wrong"" kind of moment, Fox comments on one in regards to their gender identity, and that's the closest you get to a character issue tying into the plot (and it's resolved in one conversation with no mentioning of it again, because again, these interactions happen outside of the plot).

TDLR: If this story would've actually done more with the characters, your relationship them and with each other as a supposed friend group, the gods, and lacked a dragon, I may have enjoyed reading it more. Otherwise, the first free chapters I read, felt like they promised a completely different experience then what was offered in the paid portion and that may have turned my opinions so sour.
 You guys need to release these games with chapter checkpoints, like many of your contemporaries do. Its so frustrating to fail checks because of how vaguely you decide to word a choice. Although I enjoyed the first game, I didn't liked the story of the second one, after a few hours of playing it, I stopped. Good This game is as dull as the original and feels very.. forced for lack of better term. Don‚Äôt recommend.",0.10133460723304472

They haven't updated the image. .... Had played this game for years. and just now found out they removed troop training for a bland generic piece of trash call in infantry. THEY ARENT EVEN GOOD. they are AVERAGE.

false advertising. To anybody reading this, take note that you will see many positive reviews here, and I previously would have been one of those reviewers. However, also take note that these glowing endorsements were all written BEFORE Relic released a patch (December 2015) that removed essentially the single most important aspect of the Elite Troops Doctrine, which was the ability to field veteran troops early in the battle. There is absolutely nothing else worth paying for now that this ability has been removed. The Tiger Ace comes far too late in the battle to be of any strategic value and, when it does, it virtually cripples the rest of your fighting force. I've defended Relic and this game's... ahem... extensive additional costs for years, but this is where I'm seriously considering demanding my money back for this particular DLC content. This Commander has been rendered impotent now. Do not bother wasting your money on this junk if you're buying from 2016 onwards.

The visuals are definitely what would grab your attention. But once you spend some time playing the game, you can see that there's some substance to go with that style.

The game has a comprehensive tutorial mode. Besides explaining the rules and mechanics, it also includes a tutorial on playing shoot-em-ups in general for newcomers to the genre. You'll learn essential techniques like tapping to dodge bullets.

In arcade mode, you start with 3 lives, and you get more as you evolve within one playthrough. Similar to the dev's other game, Steel Vampire, this one also encourages aggressive play. Getting up close to enemies yields better items, which is how you regain lives and charge up your V.o.M (bombs), making it worth the risk. The game offers no continues once you lose all lives, but you can always start from any stage that you've already finished. Also, you unlock new ship variants as you fulfill certain criteria.

Chronicle mode gives this game even more replay value. You progress through multiple branching paths, with certain paths leading to an ending, unlocking more of the game's lore. Every time you play, you acquire new weapons to mix and match, of which there are many. The farther you get, the higher the level of these weapons. For weak weapons that you no longer need, you consume them for points, which you would use to enhance your ship. It's a rewarding play cycle that kept me going back.

If the nudity makes you hesitant to get into the game, you can switch that off and keep things PG. The game looks good either way. Props to the dev for giving players options. More games should follow this example. This game is incredibly fun and also happens to be one of the most visually striking games I've ever played. I strongly recommend this. It's peak This game is completely nuts. Strange, downright bizarre visuals. Just play it, it's a treat. This games great. Its very fun and addicting. If your familiar with the creator and like thier other games youll like this one. Its very Giger inspired and features kind of body horror and some nudity which can be turned on or off in the settings. Really cool
I thought the art style would be a bit much but it's awesome

I ended up using cheat engine to get by some of the late levels, I just don't have the patience anymore for difficulty. Then it crashed to desktop on the last level, maybe intentionally(?).

There's no filler to pad out the hours, just a couple of hours of thoughtfully designed difficulty. Great 3 hour parkour platformer, will be in my top recommendations for any friend looking for a short game. Honestly by the end of the second section out of I think 4 or 5 sections I started getting infuriated because of how the levels got harder AND longer. I also really didn't like that you can't move manually and that its just auto running. Lastly some parts you have to be ridiculously precise even in the first section which just shouldn't be a thing until MAYBE the last couple levels of the game which I was nowhere near.

A hidden gem that should deserve more love, the platforming is great and the twist bends it into a dynamic, juicy and very enjoyable puzzle game.

Fast, challenging and polished, great value for its price! A fun, stylish, and difficult platformer with enough mechanics and tricks to keep you engaged throughout. The progression in difficulty is fairly linear through the main stages, with a few outliers that test your skill.

613450,Please Knock on My Door,game,False,"7 Sep, 2017",Indie,A summary of every emotion you'd rather lock away and forget.,"i played it the way i live my depression at first: stay in bed, watch vids without capturing info, binge eat, take a shower to temporarily feel okay again only to fall back, coming late to work a few times in a week.... and yeah the narrator did not hold back. some of his sentences hit close. the better route is smth i know i need to do...... bu im so busy beating myself down. i love story filled games This game is like peering into the mind of the kind of guy you‚Äôd swipe left on so hard it might break your phone. He‚Äôs basically a walking red flag factory, and the game unintentionally showcases exactly why you‚Äôd want to steer clear of him. Let‚Äôs dig into the traits that make him undateable and why this perspective is such a dumpster fire of relationship dynamics.

Why You‚Äôd Never Date This Guy
	1.	He‚Äôs an Emotional Black Hole:
	‚Ä¢	His entire emotional world revolves around what others can do for him (e.g., Jenny‚Äôs ‚Äúhi,‚Äù validation from coworkers).
	‚Ä¢	In a relationship, you‚Äôd spend all your energy trying to fill his endless void, while he contributes‚Ä¶ exactly nothing.
	2.	He Confuses Affection with Salvation:
	‚Ä¢	His obsession with Jenny‚Äôs simple acknowledgment screams: ‚ÄúSave me!‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	He‚Äôs not looking for a partner‚Äîhe‚Äôs looking for a therapist, life coach, and emotional crutch.
	3.	He‚Äôs Passive and Avoidant:
	‚Ä¢	Instead of confronting his problems, he hides in showers or waits for someone else to fix things. Imagine dating someone whose go-to strategy is:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúMaybe if I do nothing, it‚Äôll all magically get better.‚Äù
	4.	His Self-Awareness is Zero:
	‚Ä¢	He doesn‚Äôt reflect on why he feels the way he does or take steps to improve himself. He‚Äôs stuck in blame-the-world mode, and you‚Äôd be stuck paying the emotional toll.
	5.	He Has No Idea What He Wants:
	‚Ä¢	His feelings are chaotic and undefined. One minute he‚Äôs desperate for connection; the next, he‚Äôs avoiding people altogether. In a relationship, this would translate to mixed signals and endless frustration.

How He‚Äôd Be as a Boyfriend
	1.	Every Day Would Be a Therapy Session:
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôd constantly reassure him, validate his feelings, and convince him he‚Äôs not a failure. It‚Äôd be exhausting‚Äîand completely one-sided.
	2.	He‚Äôd Weaponize His Sadness:
	‚Ä¢	Whenever you brought up your own needs or problems, he‚Äôd deflect with ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm already struggling so much!‚Äù You‚Äôd end up prioritizing his feelings over your own just to avoid conflict.
	3.	He‚Äôd Be Emotionally Inconsistent:
	‚Ä¢	Some days he‚Äôd cling to you like his life depended on it. Other days he‚Äôd disappear into his own sadness and leave you wondering what you did wrong.
	4.	He‚Äôd Never Appreciate Your Effort:
	‚Ä¢	No matter how much you supported him, it would never feel like enough‚Äîbecause the real problem isn‚Äôt you, it‚Äôs his inability to take accountability for his emotions.

What Makes His Perspective So Cringeworthy
	1.	It‚Äôs Centered on Himself:
	‚Ä¢	The game revolves around his internal struggles, but he never acknowledges the impact of his behavior on others. A relationship with him would feel completely one-sided.
	2.	Jenny is Just a Symbol:
	‚Ä¢	He doesn‚Äôt actually care about Jenny as a person‚Äîhe cares about what she represents: validation and potential intimacy. That‚Äôs not love‚Äîit‚Äôs selfishness disguised as longing.
	3.	He Romanticizes His Own Pain:
	‚Ä¢	His self-pity is off the charts. He‚Äôs not looking for solutions or growth‚Äîhe‚Äôs wallowing because it makes him feel tragically misunderstood.

The Real Red Flag: He‚Äôs Stuck in a Fantasy
	1.	He Wants to Be Saved, Not Loved:
	‚Ä¢	He‚Äôs not looking for a partner‚Äîhe‚Äôs looking for someone to fix him. That‚Äôs not a relationship; it‚Äôs emotional labor with no payoff.
	2.	He‚Äôs Obsessed with the Idea of Connection:
	‚Ä¢	His fixation on Jenny‚Äôs ‚Äúhi‚Äù isn‚Äôt about real intimacy‚Äîit‚Äôs about the fantasy that someone else can solve his problems. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôd check out the moment reality hits and effort is required.
	3.	He Avoids Accountability Like the Plague:
	‚Ä¢	He‚Äôs not interested in improving himself‚Äîhe just wants others to carry his emotional burden. Any attempt to call him out on this would probably be met with defensiveness or excuses.

Final Thought

This dude isn‚Äôt just undateable‚Äîhe‚Äôs a walking ‚Äúthis is why we have boundaries‚Äù PSA. The game might frame him as a misunderstood, tragic figure, but the truth is, he‚Äôs the kind of guy who‚Äôd leave you drained, frustrated, and questioning your life choices. If anything, this game is a great reminder of what to avoid in a partner. Thoughts are just thoughts. Let them pass. love it This game is such a tear jerker, I was thoroughly surprised. Though it seems like just a simple game, its so much deep than that. If you enjoy deep story driven games, this is absolutely a game you should check out. This game is perfect. But it's hard if you're not aware of how you're feeling until you play it. This game touches on mental health and depression in an amazing way. It felt almost crushing to play what felt like my life from a 3rd person perspective. The soundtrack is beautiful as well. Please do play but play with caution. Good game, but be prepared to be sad. It'll be okay though. As a man who used to suffer from severe depression more than once,
I know the feeling.
I know the voice came from my brain just like that in the game.
I thought that no one cared me.
Feeling there's no future in my life,and I just wanted to end all of this.
I didn't have energy and interest to do anything,and i can't,just want to stay in my bed for hole day,because it makes me feel better.
The voice persuaded me to give up, but I didn't.
Now my depression is not that severe now.
Waiting for the people who would knock the door of my heart,but he didn't come.
Like the tree standing on the ground,as people passing by.and no one stops and have a look.
Some roads can only be one person,and the road is still long.
Please forgive me for my poor English.
Great game,I hope that I can translate it into Chinese one day,if possible.
Let more people know,and resonate with.

2657480,Cricket Through the Ages,game,False,"1 Mar, 2024","Action, Casual, Sports","Swing bats and throw balls through the intertwined histories of humankind and cricket in this one button, physics-driven game.","Truly one of the most historically accurate games I have ever played fun skill if u suck 2 player with no one Super fun two-player game. My kids were laughing for hours. Highly recommend for an obsurd, silly and clever low-time-commitment game. it is good but its very short please give more update Caveman play cricket. I like! :) ooga booga! Overall a fun, interesting, quirky game, good for a quick laugh either by yourself or with a friend. 
My only complaint about the game is that it never explicitly tells you what the controls are, nor is there any sort of info about controls anywhere in the game, not even in the main/pause menus. With a quick Google search, it seems that the entire game is played with a singular button, but I'm honestly not sure if I believe that, as pressing different buttons/keys seems to cause the characters to move in slightly different ways. 

The art style is nice enough for such a simple game, and the game as a whole works as intended. I did not come across any bugs or strange behavior from the game. An amazing gem of a game! I had an excellent time with the developer's previous title Broforce and I think Cricket Through The Ages knocks it out of the park (heh) in the same way.

It's hilarious, easy to pick up and surprisingly thought-provoking and philosophical. Dials the whimsy while keeping it readable and very playable - an extremely rare combination.

Art, animations, sound design and ""feel"" are all on point. Super creative work, at less than $10 this is a must buy.

Truly great co-op games are hard to find. Thanks developers! ---{ Graphics }---

Quick tip to get the higest jump possible, while running, turn left down at your feet and shoot right as you jump. This is due to the rocket coming out slightly to the right of the crosshair

[spoiler] And if you move right while in the air and shoot you hit yourself for infinite rocket jump [/spoiler] I think that there is a lot of promise but some of the game's core mechanics are just frustrating. I bought this game for me and a friend and we compared our experiences as we played through it. We concurred on every point. I would for sure recommend this game if the checkpoint system and the jump boost mechanics were altered a fair bit. Let me explain:

1. The checkpoints are single-use and have a very long timer cooldown. This is frustrating if you're a medium-ability player because (especially for reasons explained below) you can't predict how the mechanics of a jump might go, so you end up waiting for the checkpoint meter to refill because that saves you more time in the long run. It's frustrating for a low level player, because you have to keep resetting your checkpoints every time you fall off. It's frustrating for all players, becuase if you forget (froget?) to reset the checkpoint, dowwwwwwn you go again.

2. The jump boost mechanic is really unreliable. Both my friend and I concurred here too. It's very fiddly and you're never sure whether it will work. Hence, you loiter around waiting for your checkpoint meter to refill because you don't want to jump and risk resetting. Neither of us were in any way tempted by the time trial mode, as without checkpoints the unpredictable boost pads would ruin it every time.

But the game has some good points. It's got a very chilled out vibe, and depsite the frustration I never got properly mad at it or anything. I like the aesthetic and it's clearly somebody's labour of love. The core rocket jump game mechanic is pretty sound and I could quickly get into a rhythm when jumps didn't require boost pads. If the developer were to: a. fix the boost pads and b. overhaul the checkpoint system, perhaps by making checkpoints unlimited use and shaving a few seconds of the reset, or even just adding set checkpoints, I think this game has a lot of potential.

In short, I can't recommend this game (yet), but I did still make my friend play it too. Good effort developer; don't give up! First off, this is a rocket platformer. Not super obvious but thats what the game is. Second the jumps are almost IMPOSSIBLE, it took me 10 minutes to get onto the FIRST JUMP. This game is broken and horrible, youd be better off spending your 99 cents on a single bagel from target very simple but surprisingly addictive game, and its only 80c so i can definatly say its something fun to have in your library to play from time to time frog I would only this game because it is 89 cents and if you know how to ""rocket jump"" and want a platformer. However, spent about 10 minutes trying to get onto the first platform and only got up once. This game does not seem to be playtested. This is a unity game using seemingly built in assets,  it looks cheap but at least the feel of the character is decent.  
Everything you see on the screenshots in the store page is what you are going to get.


""Rocket Jump"" is a term used to describe shooting a rocket at your feet to  jump further than you would be normally able to jump. I think there are games in the early 2000's that use this mechanic more prominently. If you have never done this yourself prior to this game, than this game is not the place to learn imo",-0.027384871644130906

I don't even know what to say, this game kind of blows my mind with the realistic lives, food webs, and life cycles that you and the AI have to engage in, in order to survive and thrive. .

The gameplay is rather pleasant if your looking for quality bug sims this is the go, 

it also has a map editor should you want to customise your experience, 

it has a bit more unique insects, though the gripe i have is it lacks moths, 

which a lovely commentor let me know would likely be remedied in future [even if distant], 

the game seems to have continued to get updates even after i first published this review on dec 26 2024, 

as such if you get this game you can expect to keep having more content to enjoy, 

which funnily enough other games cant claim such I'm gonna be completely honest, this game is pretty good. It has great graphics, great storylines, and beautiful animation. The unfortunate part is, that after a while of playing it; it tends to get very boring and dull; just the same thing over and over again. It is fun about the first ten times, though; so install it if you dare. its a good game needs a better tutorial though A great game, lots of insects eating eachother.

now to ACTUALLY talk about it, it's a survival experience where YOU get to play as the  tiny creatures you may step on and not notice, you get to see how they live and the struggles they go for, you get to learn [i] how [/i] it feels to be a spider, wasp, butterfly, or anything else really. this game has a future and i am lookin forward to it, its good i wish i could eat my mantis husband :(

It's rather annoying to have to constantly summon new jigsaw pieces instead of just having them all on the board. As is the lack of locking them in place when they're correct. It's a nice touch to see how oddly shaped pieces thrown in to mix things up a bit. And after that, you just drag the mouse rapidly across their clothing to see a 1 second looping animation and... that's all. Easy Achievements I guess. A puzzle game.

It was SUUPER CUTE and funny! The game was a nice short play-through of 6hrs. However, you might find some triggers in it. 

First off, here's a game description, since the store page didn't add one in English:

Follow, the main characters Sanezawa senpai (MC) and his junior Aijima who attend meetings for a club named ""The Local History Research Association"" which is actually a front for an occult society that likes to study supernatural phenomena. It's an erotic paranormal bl comedy, that follows the two characters around the town on a hunt for a rumored Yokai. A Yokai that appears and traps it's prey, while also giving them a feeling like never before! ;) Curious about the rumored sightings of this Yokai that lures in men, and traps them in dark alleyways, the two set off on the town (if that's the choice you make first) in search of this Yokai entity.

NOW WARNING & Possible game spoilers as I explain: This game does include triggers such as [spoiler]Getting drunk in one scene, but nothing intimate happening other than a kiss, water-sports, (also known as urine kinks), Glory hole sex, exactly what the name involves (this occurs in a bad end) and could be considered dub-con/non-con depending on one's perspective, because although the MC seems to want it, and initiates it --hoping it will help him escape the Yokai's grasp...the MC is still trapped by the Yokai in the first place, and also appears to be under the Yokai's powers/spell (we also never see the Yokai either, just the Glory hole) Hence why it could be seen as non-con/dub-con.

For the other triggers, it's subtly hinting at death in the two bad ends (one is the MCs RO as MC goes back to his apartment, and RO never returns from his hunt for the Yokai), and the other is of the MC and the yokai. Also, the MC's backstory which involves non-con, but you don't play through it if that's of interest to know, it's him relaying what happened to him in his past and where he's at currently with feelings towards having sex back then and now.[/spoiler] 

I tried to put spoilers (it will be my first time adding spoilers on a review, so hopefully it works, and I'll try to fix it if it doesn't work the first time). I do recommend this game tho, it's not really dark in my opinion, it's more funny, lighthearted, and the good end was entirely consenting between the MC and his RO. Plus, super cute! Also, the longest route the game has to offer! Even the two bad ends weren't really that bad, tbh. 

It was a super easy play-through as well and not complicated which I loved about it. The graphics and art also great, but the NSFW scenes are censored with pixels btw. Also, I speak English and had to use a translator to play this game. Yup, btw, NOT AN ENGLISH based game, just an English review of it. Sorry to burst that bubble, if you were hopeful for a min, but this game DOES NOT HAVE ANY ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS as of right now.

You can however, play using a translator you like (I used Textractor, but there are many out there) to help you read the game in your own language (although with usually poor translations compared to a real professional one). But, my translator worked pretty well and it was enough to still buy, and enjoy playing this game! 100% recommend it!

So to summarize:
-Not an English translated game (yet, hopefully they make one in the future), I do believe the menu config screen had the options to play with Japanese or Chinese subtitles, but I just played it as it was.
-It does have some triggers for some people (I left those in spoilers just in case)
-Super cute, funny, and lighthearted
-Has full VA (excluding thoughts, narrative text and side characters), only for the main 2 characters, and during intimate scenes as well.
-Short game-play of 6.1hrs, but enjoyable nonetheless 
-Does include 2 NSFW scenes, 1 in a bad end, and you'll know it's a bad end when the end credits show up with a darker green background of sorts. And the other happy NSFW ending is the one between the MC and his RO. All NSFW is CENSORED, so just fyi in case anyone dislikes seeing pixel di***, lol.

And that's it! Hope this review helped for anyone looking to play it with a translator like I did, or for anyone in the future if they create an English translation! (btw if I have more than 6hrs logged, it's because I'm working on capturing text to make my own set of fan translations if I have time, so that it reads better, so no worries, it really is a 6hr play-through).",0.06334865629420086

[h1]Beer-Battered Potato Gargling from Hell[/h1]

I bought this by mistake when I took advantage of a deep discount sale at Christmastime. Now I know why it was free with the rest of the music pack.

[B]DO NOT PLAY THE CACOPHONY NIGHTMARES IN THIS DLC IF YOU ARE SUICIDAL.[/B]

In this world, there are many, many bad songs. ""F Your God"", any lyrics written by ""Rage Against the Machine"" (the melodies are fine), almost all thug/gangster rap that calls for crime and blood and worse, and, of course, Katy Perry's ""I Kissed a Girl and I Liked It"". There's every song ever written by Rihanna that isn't ""Please Don't Stop the Music"" or ""Bang Bang Into the Room"", and Beyonce's hate and racism in some of her most recent ""Black Supr-"" sorry, ""Black Power"" works. Then there was that one time Taylor Swift tried to be relevant by mocking the entire Christian Church (and much of America) as halfwits that only oppose social liberalism (and a law that would persecute the Church) because they are weak, scared, and bred so close together that you can call them a Habsberg. That also includes, of course, every song by Lady Gag Gag that isn't the Rucka Rucka Ali parody of ""Poker Face"".

Everyone has songs they hate. They may even have artists whose work they hate.

Here with these legendary atrocities is this abomination. Were this ""Epistle"" an Epistle, I would have become an Atheist, possibly even a Muslim, as no righteous God could permit the absolutely nightmarish garbage that encompasses this album to be distributed to His followers in the Ancient Church.

Do you remember El Presidente, the villainous dictator from the beloved ""Tropico"" series? His gruff, masculine voice and Hispanic accent is pleasing to listen to and deeply immersive when he narrates stories and missions you have to accomplish.

Take El Presidente and get him ABSOLUTELY HAMMERED on rum, then shove a potato down his throat and demand that he scream and make noises with beer in his mouth. He will gargle the beer, choke on the potato, and produce noises somewhat better than this absolute trash.

The worst ""Drunk El Presidente"" potato choke-gargling screams are the songs ""Gubbarna"" (which is painful as the name suggests) and ""Kaxraste Bradper"", because whatever garbage excuse for a character set this beastial choking used in its title caused my poor Dixie computer to have an anyuerism. I speak and write English. I saw Unicode symbols, such as those that tell Microsoft Word what a page/paragraph break entails, this weird circle with an X through it (no doubt, Slenderman was trying to rescuse my poor, bleeding ears), and more. God knows what dark font that crap was covered in.

That doesn't even begin to remotely describe my unbridled hatred of the granddaddy of all abominable drunken, potato choking, beer gargling, repetitive screams on this torture device they call a series of ""songs"".

Enter ""Movitz Ti Dina Pinnar"". If Mikael Samuelson- a pox upon his career -was what was in the kitchen with Dina, I'm going to lay down my hammers and jump on the railroad, begging whatever train is coming all the live long day. No amount of soothing banjos can give me reprieve from the suffering of ""Movitz Ti Dina Pinnar"".

This one isn't even a song. Rihanna and her ilk put more effort into their melodies and back beat rythems than whatever this was supposed to be. It's a few notes in the background with everyone's favorite Carribean dictator shouting DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN, DUNE DUNE DUNE DUNE DUNE, RUNZ RUNZ RUNZ RUNZ. Do you think I am exaggerating? No. No I am not.

Have you had enough of this trash playing in your EU4 experience? Well, imagine having a little, old-fashioned 1024 X 786 monitor, that is only ever so slightly clipped at a 0.9% User Interface rendering, which makes everything just a little bit smaller than a normal eye can read. Do you know what is clipped? The music player. I cannot turn this off on my home PC.

[U][I][B]I actually turn off my speakers until the song stops.[/b][/I][/U]

This is the kind of crap that an unionized workforce produces, and Paradox knows its union thugs. It's like I asked the California Teacher's Union to make something that would make babies laugh. Except this won't make babies laugh. It sounds like the grunts and choking of something that eats babies.

I don't know whether or not I will be punished for writing this review, so please take my warning before you accidentally purchase every ""Europa Universalis IV"" soundtrack at once, witrhout sorting through what it comes with.

Nothing will ever spare you from this abomination. The CIA should purchase this entire album to use as sensory torture and sleep deprivation equipment against ISIL terrorists being held in some spook's black site. Or Guantanamo.

I finally tracked down where those fasting choking noises. The only reason I am not filing a request to Valve to permanently remove this album from my library is because I need to retain it in order to warn you just how bad these songs are.

I was playing as Albania and the Ottomans conquered me early on. I thankfully took Colonial Ideas really early and escaped to New Orleans, where I would spend the next three centuries expanding until Theodoro, who was similarly thrown out of the Old World but managed to miraculously colonize the south of what is today Texas. Well, that Theodoro government-in-exile mutated into Texas. Everything is bigger in Texas, including the absolute ROFL-stomping the Texan Gothics gave me in the late half of the eighteenth century. I lost my capital of over three centuries and every state in Dixie except for Georgia and Alabama, who had their topmost clay shaved off by the Texan Goths.

 In symbolism for the losing of all of my state's heartland, I finally lowered the ancient double eagle flag of Albania and became Florida. These songs came on, and I realized that this was the twilight of my legendary run. I knew, though, that being violated by Texas was more pleasurable than the soundtrack to which my entire empire crumbled.

God help you if you accidentally download this. No one would PURPOSELY want this stuff.

These songs make no sense, they are loud and obnoxious, they are mostly tongue rolling, screams, and grunts, and they break both muh immersion and the otherwise smooth EU4 experience. These songs, so terrible they are, will interrupt your EU4 play through and make you PHYSICALLY ANGRY. The most essential DLC to Europa Universalis IV, literally unplayable without it. The game wouldn't be the same without it If you're Swedish, buy this for fuck sake. The songs are lit. These songs are both delightful and my absolute favorites in the songtrack.  They are authentic sounding by an extremely skilled, classically trained vocalist who has a bit of fun playing along in a role as a drunken peasant.  Every time one of these songs comes up, it brightens my playthrough.

I can understand why some might not like the songs, but they are wonderful and appropriate.  Far more appropriate than some pieces that intrude into inappropriate time periods, these folk-type songs fit any century.

762830,Telling Lies,game,False,"23 Aug, 2019","Adventure, Indie, Simulation",Four private lives. One big lie. Search through secretly recorded video conversations to discover the truth. The successor to the acclaimed Her Story.,"[i]Telling Lies[/i] definitely represents an upwards trajectory for Sam Barlow from the [i]Her Story[/i] days in terms of scope and ambition. I suppose that comparisons between this game and both its predecessor and successor ([i]Immortality[/i]) are unavoidable, both because of Barlow's unique style and also because there aren't that many decent FMVs out there.

The reviews are very mixed, and I think I can get why: the story itself is less riveting than either [i]Her Story[/i]'s or [i]Immortality[/i]'s (it's also possible that I was just unlucky to get very important videos in my first two hours of play and connected the dots together quickly), and the gameplay suffers from endless mandatory manual rewinding which in the end probably accounts for a couple wasted hours.
Personally, I was able to make abstraction of that problem to focus on the interpersonal drama that's the heart of [i]Telling Lies[/i]. I do think the game does a very good job of showing the complexity of the relationships between the characters: Barlow writes women in particular, in a way that is consistently engaging, and I really loved all three actresses here.

Basically, this is not a Must Play game, but if you have tried other FMVs and enjoyed them, I think [i]Telling Lies[/i] is one of the stronger games of the genre. Although it is more for the completionists, and if you want to only play one Barlow game, I'll advise to try [i]Immortality[/i] instead. Loved the tag system here and the way you search keywords to unlock new media. 

Really good FMV game. Telling Lies was a totally unique and immersive experience‚Äîmy first time playing a game like this, and I really enjoyed it. The acting was phenomenal and the story was incredibly engaging. I loved piecing together the narrative through video clips, even though I wish the game had been a bit clearer about its objective from the start. The rewind and fast-forward mechanics felt a little clunky, especially how long it took to rewind. I also would‚Äôve liked the option to view all three endings at the end instead of just one. Still, it was a compelling and memorable game that I‚Äôd definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys story-driven experiences. The only engaging part of this game is figuring out it was based on real events. However, the gameplay, which barely exists, is so garbage it undermines the entire thing. This is BRUTAL. Her Story, Immortality, FMV games in general are a favorite of mine. This game having such long videos, with the longest most boring pauses makes it an absolute chore to play. I got it on sale for $5 and I still don't think it is worth it at that price. I didn't make it far enough to know what the mystery could be and I'm not confident I'll ever be able to. I got the game after playing Her Story and loving it. Unfortunately, Telling Lies didn‚Äôt leave the same impression.

I played the game just like Her Story‚Äîtogether with my wife. I was operating the game, while she was taking notes and directing searches.

One issue was the length of the videos. Previously, they lasted up to a minute, but now the clips can drag on for 10 minutes! Also, many videos have two versions‚Äîshowing two people talking, but in each clip, we hear just one side of the conversation. This disrupts the careful balance between watching and playing that Her Story nailed perfectly.

The main plot didn‚Äôt really resonate with me. In first few hours, you pretty much understand the role the guy played in the lives of the three women. As far as I can tell, there are no sudden twists or turns to shake things up or change your opinion. You just gradually uncover more details without stumbling upon anything truly gripping.

Another thing is that having a sex worker as one of the main characters didn't exactly help pique my wife's interest in the game. 4/10 Bottom line up front: The UI/navigation in this game can sour it for many people; it didn't for me. If you like other Sam Barlow/Half Mermaid games then give this a try (you can always refund it w/in Steam's restrictions). I let the negative reviews on account of the UI/navigation steer me away from this for a long time and I now regret that. It is phenomenal.

The review proper: 'Telling Lies' adopts a very similar gameplay experience as its predecessor, 'Her Story': type a word or phrase into a database search box, watch a clip, use info in that clip to inform future search queries, and unravel a mystery all while doing so. (If you have not played 'Her Story,' I strongly recommend doing so before purchasing this game; it is slightly simpler but will act as a good litmus test for whether 'Telling Lies' will jive with you.) The story is much stronger in 'Telling Lies,' if only because you engage with a greater number of characters (roughly four main ones). By the time one reaches the end of the game (having watched such-and-such many videos, including certain key ones) they are suffused with the narrative's themes, subtext, and irony. It is a slow burn, but one well worth enduring. Fortunately, Water is Life.

The black eye on this game, as most negative reviews single out, involves how one navigates the videos. Unlike 'Her Story,' most of 'Telling Lies' 's videos come from two-way FaceTime-style calls. That means some videos will have minutes-long breaks of silence from one party, indicating its complementary video to involve someone else talking for that time. The game allows for fast-forwarding and rewinding, but the maximum speed at which one can do so can still be painfully slow in many cases. When choosing a video to play it will start at the time during which the relevant word the player searched is tokened by its speaker. In a 9-minute video whose search term appears at the end, rewinding to the beginning at max speed can take minutes. Even if patience is a virtue, in gaming and in life, no virtuous person enjoys spending minutes at a time rewinding a video.

Some have suggested that it would have been useful to have a synchronization function that, once one has identified a correct video-pair, they can synchronize them in order to watch both simultaneously and experience the conversation in real-time, rather than trying to piece it together by going back and forth between the clips. I can't say I disagree, but I wouldn't say this would necessarily make for a better game, just a different one. The lack of such a function didn't bother me in my playthrough. And one can always watch YouTube videos of the completed video pairs afterwards.

Overall, I strongly recommend this game for fans of Barlow/Half Mermaid's other FMV titles. Do not let the negative reviews stop you from at least trying it. I have to say no, because the core of gameplay goes to show the devs have NO talent. You need a mod to have decent control of the video player. Seeing as this is the core of gameplay...it fails.

Nothing else about the game matters. Scrolling through without a mod is painful. The story starts out interesting but becomes a lazy trope quickly. The ending is modern trash, about forgetting the part of your past that is inconvenient.

This game is forgettable trash, made by a team that has no concept of what makes good game play. After 44 years of playing games...this is a stinker. A compelling premise ruined by a terrible control scheme.

The gimmick is that you're searching videos via words in their subtitles.  The problem is, there is no button to go to the front of the clip.  You have to manually rewind it at a maximum of 3x speed.  But there's more! These are local copies of Skype calls, meaning you'll need to piece videos together based on their overlap to get the whole conversation.  Which means you will spend roughly 50% of your in-game time watching videos rewind at 3x speed.

There is allegedly a mod that adds a few controls, but it's not on ModDB or NexusMods.  After 45 minutes, I gave up.

Skip this one.  Her Story and Immortality are both better.",0.055996375419452266
683990,Star Realms - Cosmic Gambit,dlc,False,"13 Sep, 2017",Strategy,"The expansion contains 19 cards that you can use in online play, versus the AI or a friend, or in the 11th and 12th chapters of the campaign.","Yet more trash gambit cards that completely unbalance the game from turn 1
If you are going to avoid any DLC, let it be these gambit ones. This expansion sucks. Gambits will quite often scewer the game heavily in one players favor, from the very beginning. In a game where the luck of the draw, is already a big factor, this expansion will actively break the game. Eeeeehhh ... okay, the only reason to get Cosmic Gambits in the digital is for everything [i]other[/i] than the gambits. The year two promo cards are phenominal. I'm especially a fan of the additions to Trade Fed. Since WWG doesn't seem to want to tell you what you're buying, see below for the new ships. Also, as far as I can tell, it adds 2 new ships per faction, not 1 base + 1 ship as advertised.

Explanation: T=Trade, HP=Authority/Health/Whatever, C=Combat
- Unaligned: [b]Merc Battlecruiser:[/b] 6-cost; pick-your-faction with Draw 1
- Trade Fed: [b]Federal Transport: [/b]2-cost; 1T 5HP, faction +2T <- my favorite here, a great inclusion to any deck
- Trade Fed: [b]Security Craft:[/b] 4-cost; 4C 3HP, faction +3T
- Trade Fed: [b]Bounty Hunter:[/b] 5-cost; 7C, faction +5HP
- Star Empire: [b]Imperial Smuggler:[/b] 2-cost; 3C and [i]Draw a card, then discard a card.[/i]; scrap +2T
- Star Empire: [b]Knightstar:[/b] 5-cost; 6C, and [i]if opponent has a base in play, gain an additional 3C[/i]; scrap Draw 1
- Blob: [b]War Kite:[/b] 2-cost; 5C; scrap to destroy target base.
- Blob: [b]Stellar Ray:[/b] 5-cost; 3C, Draw 1; scrap +6C
- Machine Cult: [b]Probe Bot:[/b] 1T, scrap 1; faction Draw 1; scrap +3C <- [i]possibly the best low-cost scrapper in the game at this point. Some trade, draw, AND self-scrap when no longer needed![/i] 
- Machine Cult: [b]Cargo Mech:[/b] 5-cost; 4T, scrap 1; faction Destroy Base

Gambits are nice; in the physical card game, I love using them in a draft-pick system, where player 1 picks one, player two picks 2, then player 1 picks his second; after the match (if playing more than one), remove the 4 chosen gambits from the pool for the next draft pick (to prevent repetition).

Same as with the previous gambits in this set, though, you're stuck with the bland 2-at-random base mechanic, which sucks and often leaves one player possibly feeling helpless.

Some of the gambits are a huge departure from the previous set though, which is nice. The one that lets your vipers do +2C actually makes vipers useful throughout the game. There are a couple in there that let you scrap early on, which gives you a massive advantage over the one who doesn't have it. Scrap both my vipers on turn 1? Yes, please.

However, I've noticed that a couple of the gambits in the digital version are gimped compared to their physical counterparts. And, I realized that it's because WWG didn't actually code in a persistant scrap heap, or the ability to add cards to the trade lineup. 

Compare:

[Physical] Black Market: Add an additional space to the trade row above Black Market. Once per turn, the player who revealed Black Market may acquire a card from this space for one less than its trade cost. Otherwise, it functions as a normal trade row space for all players.

With:

[Digital] Black Market: Scrap: Choose a faction. This turn, all cards of that faction cost 1T less than normal.

And compare:

[Physical] Triumphant Return: Scrap to Draw 1; When you reveal this Gambit, you may pay the cost of a card in the scrap heap and put it into your hand. (Scouts and Vipers cost 0)

With:

[Digital] Triumphant Return: Scrap: Pay the cost of a card in your discard pile to put it into your hand. (Scouts and Vipers cost 0).

So yeah, I am underwhelmed with the gambits themselves. Get the set for the ships, though.",-0.12382376395534285

Has a total of [b]5[/b] trading cards. You get what you pay for with this one. For a game priced at 70 cents, I didn‚Äôt expect much, but even then, it's disappointing. The gameplay feels shallow, and the level design lacks any real logic or purpose. It feels like the developers threw random elements together without much thought. Overall, it's hard to find any redeeming qualities. Retro 16-bit graphics that look decent, and a platform experience that emphasizes challenge and hard difficulty.

Does not work well in ultrawidescreen monitors, even if windowed, as the game cuts off the top and bottom part of the screen, and making thus the game unplayable in most situations.

Terrible controls, and even worse UI, restarting on death - which will occur a lot - requires manually clicking on a restart button.

Music is the same track looping over and over, and gets tedious extremely quickly.

The game is definitely not worth its full asking price. At a steep discount or for free, could be passable, but there are plenty of better alternatives in the Steam Store. 4/10 I am 32 years old.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

On one hand, the game can be very challenging and requires a lot of strategic thinking to progress through the levels. The game mechanics are also interesting and keep you engaged with its fast-paced action.

However, there are some downsides to the game as well. For starters, the difficulty level can be frustratingly high, and it may take multiple attempts to succeed at a particular stage. This may turn off some players who are looking for more casual gameplay.

Additionally, the game's graphics and sound effects are not particularly impressive, which may be a letdown for players who prefer games with more polished visuals and sounds.

That being said, the game does have some redeeming qualities. The game's skilled-based nature makes it all the more satisfying when you finally succeed, and the game modes offer a variety of different gameplay experiences to explore.

Overall, Dynamic Very, Very, Hard game is a decent game that is worth giving a try if you're looking for a challenge. However, the game's high difficulty level and lackluster graphics may not be suitable for everyone's taste. Outside of getting it for the trading cards I wouldn't recommend this game. Controls are wonky being the biggest issue.
 Bro... ""good"" idea but horribly made. Bad collisions, bad level design, levels that are easier than the ones before, some things just don't work (like the final door of red forest). I think that if this game was free, it would be kinda acceptable, but it isn't.
Fix this game or explain to me why this game is worth. They say this game is very hard. The most difficult part about it must be not asking for a refund. Reviews are mostly negative, don't know why I have the game, or how I got it. Screenshots are not appealing to me.",-0.07169699139623956

Good story, good graphics, enjoyable puzzles.  I will soon play the other Redemption Cemetery games. This game follows the same plot of getting locked in the cemetery. You have to set right the wrongs so the lost souls can find peace before you may leave. Another excellently put together story. This game has not only an map it also has a strategy guide (which can be handy).  The letter from the developers is, I think a very nice touch.(thank you devs) The bonus game takes up right where the main story leaves off. The puppy games are cute and can also give you some practice if you so desire. I enjoyed the game immensely. Thanx fair story, graphics are dreamy, long game.

[b]Story[/b]:

On the way home one night, you suddenly realize that the subway is not making its usual stops, and there's something strange about the passengers... The end of the line, a cemetery where a corporeal spirit takes your beloved cocker spaniel as a hostage in order to gain your assistance.  Help three lost souls find peace, and you and your dog are free to go.

[b]Gameplay[/b]:

Be on the lookout for [b]collectible medals[/b], although they're pretty hard to miss. ;)

You have been given a [b]raven[/b] to assist you in your quest.  This raven will gain the power of the elements as you progress in the game, allowing it to help you with things you'd normally need a tool for... If you were able to accomplish these things at all!  You will need to charge each power (by doing a mini-game) before it can be used, but you will get multiple uses per charge.

Inventory items with a + sign can be combined with other items - just drag and drop one on top of the other.

The [b]MAP[/b] can be interactive, and has insta-transport available.  Directional [b]HINTS[/b] are also available.

We have two types of [b]Hidden Object Scenes[/b]: Lightly-interactive find-by-list, and highly-interactive silhouette puzzles.  HOS repeat, but items you found the first time there will stay gone.

[b]Bonus Chapter[/b]:

We have a clear and satisfying ending to the main game, but the extra chapter continues the story just a little longer.  A demon is trying to break into our world, and your help is needed to stop it.

The gameplay is solid - just as good as in the main game - and I might have enjoyed it even more.

[b]Verdict[/b]:

The elemental power of the raven added a nice depth to the gameplay, and I enjoyed all four of the stories.  The built-in breaking points between stories is great for when you have a limited amount of time to play, each story lasting about an hour.  The puppy mini-games added an additional 30 minutes to my gametime.

It was such a pleasure to play this game, I just found it to be really fun.  It seems like every game that I play in the series is more and more enjoyable. Recommended! Recommend... for the most part.

.No indication when objects in correct position for possible use

Final opinion (7.5/10):
I really enjoyed the music, adventure play, hidden object scenes and mini-puzzles and can recommend the game without reservation on the basis of those things.  But I am not really a fan of the game overall.  I expected a game with cemetery in the name and about ghosts to take place in a cemetery and be, spooky, if not actually scary.  Instead the cemetery was simply the base of operations and the action took place at a sun-washed zoo, a sterile power plant and then a pretty moon-lit village in the middle ages, and none of it was the least bit spooky, let alone scary.  Also the 'redemption' made no sense as I did all the work so they earned nothing.  Worse, my interference creates a time paradox, rending the story even more illogical.  And the whole puppy award thing was more appropriate for children.  So it wasn't really for me but might be for you. Part of a series, this continuation is on par with the others.
A bit on the simplistic side, with some puzzles thrown in with the usual hidden object games, if you're intermediate and above, this will be a quick game. It has some extras thrown in... Games to play with your dog if you complete all the puzzles and find all the little dog metals. Concept art, wall papers, stuff like that.
All in all, it's a nice little addition to the series but not something one would strain their brain on. This is definitely an older hidden object game, but not an OLD one. The interface is a tiny bit clunky but solid in function, and the plot is . . honestly refreshingly simple and straightforward.  You're in this to save your dog. There's cute extra goodies, and decent puzzles. Taking a subway late can lead to interesting places or be a meeting place for mysterious people. The three users with you seemed to come from another times and only you and your dog seem to be real, as when arriving to a cemetary, the persons became ghosts. Hina, the keeper of the place, kidnaps your dog, only for you to help these ghosts to find peace by changing the outcomes of the events tormenting them: a gone too soon journalist, a dam worker left behind and a falsely accused of witchcraft young woman...

I must say that it's probably one of the rare casual adventure games without a precise villain. Hina, the keeper, is a kind spirit, your dog is just kidnapped for making sure that you'll help her and the ghosts, lamenting themselves and feeling responsible for the death of others (though the zookeeper is the only one that wasn't driven by selfish reasons and could have save the journalist if only these keys weren't stolen). In fact, the enemies are mainly in these events and are merely humans, none being of supernatural nature. If you want to find the latter, it's in the bonus chapter, set after the main story.

I liked being sent in time and save the life of those who shouldn't have died, tormenting souls for eternity as they're regretting their choices (but again, the zookeeper felt guilty as he was a genuine man that did everything he could but it wasn't enough, I'm pretty sure that given the storyline, you'll be agreeing that he shouldn't have  be in this limbo).

The gameplay is quite the standard one for that kind of games: find items, combine them, use them, solve puzzles and clear hidden objects scenes (list of objects or find objects of the same type). I'm rarely negative for that aspect, however, here, I feel that I should perhaps warn you about some puzzles being long and kinda frustrating or that some hidden objects scenes are just annoying.

The graphics are nice and the soundtrack fits really in the game.

Yet, I was a little disappointed by this game, maybe because I was imagining something else or because I was expecting something else from ERS or because having added its profile to Neoseeker (and the whole series), I misunderstood the concept behind Redemption Cemetery (unless Salvation of the Lost was softer than the other games, as I didn't play them).

The good surprise is probably the letter let by ERS for the gamers and the puppy's room, where you can play with the puppy, if you find medals scattered in the game. It's also the only place where you'll find ""achievements"". The rest of the bonus are just classic: music, movies, wallpapers, minigames, concept arts, etc..

Should you buy the game? I would say that better games of the same genre are outside. However, it's still enjoyable if you don't encounter the same crash I had on Windows 7, making me switch to Windows 8.1 where it ran perfectly. However, while the price is kinda something normal for Big Fish Games, I would still advise you to buy it when there is a discount. soooooooo gooooooddddddddddddd good real good check it out.",0.08843902439024386
1369740,Dragon Lapis,game,False,"1 Oct, 2020","Adventure, Casual, Indie, RPG, Simulation, Strategy",The dawn of a new hero! A tale spanning a thousand years now begins to unfold!,"Excellent sequel!  Expanded and improved in nearly every way over Dragon Sinker.  This series has won my heart, and deserves attention from any classic JRPG fan. not my first choice for a kemco rpg, or even the dragon series. it's fairly bare bones and has this fomo inducing stat system similar to ff10.  That said it's still enjoyable. just odd the formula regressed since sinker and prana Dragon Lapis, an pixelated light JRPG. It's like playing one on the GBC....but without the depth.
You get your party of 4 and (the biggest pro) can change Jobs. To master said Jobs you must find Job-plates and than gain special points to full those plates (for each Job you'll need many many plates).

Now that is the selling point for this game and also his biggest weakness.
You see to gain points you'll need grinding excessive grinding.
In fact there are 2 ways to play this game:
a) forget about the Jobs and play a real JRPG.
b) do the Jobs and the associated 2 extra dungeons and the rest of the game is like a walking sim.....I played on Hard and finished the last opponent with 1 Hit.

The gameplay is very straightforward. You must defeat and evil and visit several dungeons. Each consist of several levels.
No secrets and encounter every few steps. Even with normal play you'll reach the highest level (99) before the endgame.
Like most of Exe games there is a normal end and if you continue playing you reach the Happy Ending. This time it is only
one short extra dungeon.

So can I recommend this game.....It has is flaws but still it was funny. dragon warrior nostalgia, I recommend the game if you're able to get it with a 35-50% discount Great RPG. Another serviceable entry by the KEMCO team.  Dragon Lapis is a straight-foward retro JRPG.  

Pros: The job system is well-implemented with growth plates giving you real control over how each character develops, making progression satisfying.  There are two sorts of in game currency, gold and lapis.  Lapis gives you the option to purchase items that significantly increase your power, if you so choose.

Cons: Other than the job system, there isn't a lot of depth here, which is unfortunate because the job system would support it.  For example, monsters mostly lack strengths, weaknesses, or immunity.  There are no found items outside treasure chests - which seemed like an obvious mechanic for thieves and merchants.  No crafting to speak of.  The game is also quite easy, even on hard mode.

Recommendations:  Get it on sale.  Its plays well enough it can hook you, which says a lot more than many throw-back JRPGs, so it is worth buying.  Play it on hard mode and stay out of the lapis store if you want a meaningful challenge (doing this will force you to spend skill points carefully as they're otherwise slow to earn).

Edit:  Changing to not recommend. 

There is endgame content that makes lapis store purchases effectively necessary for completion.  Lapis is earned in game, not purchased so its not pay-to-win, at least not with real-world currency.  

Overall, this game just isn't balanced very well.  The main game is way too easy relative to the progression system - the developers really need to start paying more attention to this as it doesn't do justice to otherwise solid work.  Unfortunately, this is EXE-Creates MO - they have some good ideas, but don't take the time to flesh any of them out.  Would be curious to see what the team could do if given the time to really complete one of their games.  This game has an inspired job system, for a throw-back JRPG, that is begging for a more complete game to be built around it.  But that's about it. Very excellent game!! There's two ways to getting your stats up. Through regular fighting and the growth plate system. The growth plate system is very vital to getting your stats up as well and via the growth plate system it can help your stats go into the five digit range with your HP being capped at 99,999 even though  the max party level is only 99. Excellent story as well along with hilarious  dialogue. Definitely worth buying!!",0.09740379291251385

 I'm not gonna lie when I say I have mixed feelings on Kuro 2 so I was a bit burnt out after I played that on 2023. However, when they showed Kai information and then more news came up the months after, my hype for the series was slowly reignited and then release date came. After a month or two of release, I have heard great things about the game and I was looking forward to seeing what lies in store within it.

Needless to say, Peak fiction. This is the type of game in the series that I've been waiting for where it answers a lot of the series mysteries while still delivering great character moments. Music is still a mixed bag where the highs are really high and then some songs are just uninspired but it's a great improvement overall from the previous Calvard games. This game is a treat for longtime fans especially to people who started the series since Sky FC and followed the japanese release order.

I dare say that this is one of the best games in the series and maybe even one of Falcom's best too.

Anyway, with all that out of the way:

I don't think I will experience another game like this in my entire life man... top 3 Holy cow, did we need a  game like this one in the Kiseki series, something that takes a big leap forward in the overarching story. I finally get to sit through a trademarked Kondo cliffhanger and I'm all about it, next game will be the best in the series up to date, and this one makes it to top 3 ez. Prepare to cry.
 I've played every game in the entire series up to now, and while I've always been a little disappointed by some elements of the storytelling, especially the complete lack of accountability for the bad guys, ultimately I've developed an incredible fondness and empathy for the main characters and their friendships and faithfulness for each other has been a source of refreshment and enjoyment for me.

For the first time ever I have zero desire to play a new game plus and dive deeper in.  I get it that societal changes and marketing to accommodate those changes require games to change, and for all the great games in the Trails series up till now I am very appreciative to Falcom for providing, and I sincerely hope that the next generation of games they produce will continue to provide enjoyment and great gaming experiences for others.  For me, It's been a fun ride on the Falcom Express, but it's time for this gamer to find another ride. Went into this game expecting it to be really good but what I didn't expect was it becoming my second favourite kiseki game (only behind azure) and one of my new favourite games in general. 
This game was phenomenal and that ending is gonna drive me nuts until the next game comes out.",0.0744827178030303
848080,Depths of Sanity,game,False,"1 Nov, 2022","Action, Adventure, Indie","A mysterious signal. A missing crew. And the one man trying to piece it all together. As Abe Douglas, dive deep into a fully underwater metroidvania to explore massive oceanic¬†biomes, battle monstrous bosses, and piece together a mystery that threatens not only your crew, but your own sanity.","FANTASTIC UNDERWATER Metroidvania, I absolutely recommend this game to MV fans, and any looking for a good and well made, underwater adventure with, Lovecraftian elements ""Depths of Sanity"" is a pixelated subnautical metroidvania with heavy emphasis on atmosphere and narrative.

You play Abe, the chief of an unterwater mission gone wrong in his hellbent attempt to rescue the missing crew with his son among them while their chances of survival dwindling the deeper he goes.

The writing and pacing of it does a good job - it is slow-burning and really reels you in (the scattered crewnotes and audiologs remind me a little of ""System Shock 2"", but maybe this comparison is a little far fetched). Overall it feels like a true interactive lovecraftian tale and the small dev team really hit the nail with it.
Atmosphere is also well done, the score gets more and more eerie and the journey more and more claustrophobic (gotta love it when a Great White charges at you in utter darkness). Only the sounddesign could be a little better in my opinion...

Gameplaywise it is your ""typical"" nautical metroidvania (which is a subgenre by now, is it?). Movement can get a little finnicky, but you get the hang of it as you go. The current streams and their traversal later on can get a little frustrating. Also, if you explore every nook and cranny, you get quite tanky in the end, which made the later bosses easier than the first ones. 
But these are just minor gripes in my opinion.

Definetly check this out, if you like atmosphere- and narrative-rich metroidvanias, the price is very fair and it deserves a broader audience! I hate giving indie titles bad reviews, and usually, if I can, I try to at least get through a good portion of this game. After a little over three hours, and the first two bosses under my belt, I can't muster the energy to continue. I couldn't help comparing this to the game Pronty--a far superior MetroidVania, with a similar underwater setting and control scheme. This game feels like the exact opposite of everything that made that game fun and worth playing. 

Movement feels like a sluggish, and difficult chore. It demands being slow and methodical, but it is often awkward and troublesome. It also throws enemies that will try and force you into environmental hazards, or just chase you until you destroy them (a fun 'glitch' happened when I got an upgrade, and was reading the text on screen, but a swarm of fish ganged up on me and killed me while reading. Great). Things get even worse when you make your way into the pitch dark areas. You will crawl and go slow, and if you run into any enemies or environmental hazards, then I guess it's your own fault.

There's little reason to engage in enemies since there's little in the way of rewards (the occasional health or missile ammo). The baddies feel spongy (playing on 'Normal' difficulty), and using your weapons is wearisome. The pea shooter you start with takes a lot of accuracy, but it's the best option you've got--The bounce shot feels built for specialized areas that are few and far between. The missiles seem like a joke: they go from zero to max velocity in speed that is insultingly slow. It makes it near impossible to hit the majority of the games enemies that move quickly, unless you are right next to them and risk contact damage. Not that it matters, since the game also feels comfortable to give you very little in means of ammunition.

The artwork in this game is also lacking. Not a big issue necessarily, but everything has this feeling of looking like a first draft of what could've been. Again, not necessary for a game per se, but I do think it should be considered when this game throws so much weight around the narrative it's trying to build. It's harder to build a weighty, immersive story when the art isn't that good, frankly.

I don't want to comment too much on the narrative, since I only played so little, and the story did seem to have a lot going for it. All I will comment on is that while I didn't mind reading all the notes and logs, it added an already slower pace to a game that moves like molasses.

What's truly irking, is that this game seems so highly regarded within the MV community. Everyone is near unanimous in singing it's praises, from r/metroidvania to the small MV youtube reviewing community. I wish I could've played the game people saw here but all I got was a tedious chore.

Pass. Great underwater metroidvania, highly reccomend Moving and maneuvering in this game is absolutely torturous. I get that it's an underwater submarine game but it probably could have been done better. It feels like i'm playing a pinball game and i'm the pinball. This game has great creepy vibes. A perfect setting in diving deep underwater. I loved the story, the ambient music and just the general mood of the game. The controls and gameplay are just okay but the rest kept me engaged for the entire length. A lovely gem of a Metroidvania game! It's lovecraftian and underwater theme, really give it this creepy atmosphere as you progress. This is weaved in perfectly with the game's plot and gameplay. You play as a Submarine pilot named Abe, a mission to find out what happened to his crew and son, who's ship sunk while investigating an unknown signal. What starts with normal environments and sea life, slowly turns into a nightmare as you descent deeper, as everything is corrupted by this lovecraftian horror. Which also takes hold on Abe, who slowly losing his sanity as you progress. Plot has a nice late game twist, which is obvious to those familiar with these type of stories, but it's effectively setup for the payoff.

The gameplay has a few flaws that hold it back a bit. Exploration is fun, but the game decides not to give the player access to fast travel until the last quarter, which makes backtracking very tedious and time consuming. The combat is passable which is held back by a ton of little issues that makes you just want to avoid it at points. Most of the enemies are fast, zipping around the screen making them hard to hit. The weapons have small bullets that make it even harder to hit them, on top of them being bullet sponges. Not a problem with the game's few bosses, which are all fun to fight.

Even with those flaws, I still highly recommend it. Well worth your time if you enjoy the genre. One of the most unique and memorable metroidvanias out there. A legit horror metroidvania. It has a few issues, namely many bomb and missile upgrades that are rarely ever used outside of boss fights, and the final section seemed to bug out a bit on me. However, the story, atmosphere, and experience is well worth a recommendation. A nice story-driven MV though there were few annoying enemies and cumbersome movement.

+creepy and great atmosphere, excellent use of lighting and darkness to create a sense of dread
+story is actually pretty good for a MV
+nice pixel art
-visual acuity could be better, sometimes objects blend too much into the backgrounds
-annoying enemies, some just stick to you like a glue
-map could be more hand-on with collectible locations after obtaining sonar power-up but it only show how much you missed
- I hated that gauntlet near end where you exited your sub and navigated a lengthly section that if you get hit once, you get sent back all way to the start Wow, this is a hard one. This game has so much potential that it totally flopped on. A game with incredible vision that is just painful to play. I think this is a situation where the dev had a dream, and try to make something bigger than he could handle... and thus lost energy and did a poor job rather than instead of descoping. 

Animations are really good, but colors don't mesh so it's painful to look at. (I'm sure you can see that from the store page.) Enemies have terrific variety and are wonderfully diverse, and yet hampered by poor AI that makes them tedious to fight -- that is to say, 90% of them, you can just hang outside their attack zone and shoot them, although they take a long time to kill from their huge health pools. It just seems like there's countless situations where a sub-par implementation killed terrific potential. 

The map design was, I thought, good. The cutscene atmosphere had alot of good elements, but the bland game-screen really robbed it of alot of its power. The storyline was pretty good, although probably held back a bit by the graphics. 

I think if I were to try to make a recommendation to the dev, I'd say ""make your next game's enemies more interesting"" and ""try to make your graphics blend more."" Idk, I hope that's constructive. 

Ultimately, this game had masterful understanding of the classics. I'd unquestioningly give it a thumbs-up on itch where it's commentary on an indie game's project, rather than a recommendation for other players. Well, in any event, I want to see more like this, so i'm going to give this thumbs up, although for casual or younger players, you'd probably be happier with better representations of the classic genres.

The game play is very similar with Persona 4, it's a turn based rpg game with daily activity management, getting close to people, getting strong by battling, or working. There is a lot of prostitution in the game. I can't recommend it as I can't get behind it, regret not researching before purchasing. great grinding game I thought it was great.

It's a really strong JRPG with an in-depth system, as well as some fights that are truly challenging and take a great deal of preparation to win [spoiler](I'm looking at you, hidden boss)[/spoiler]. It also uses a Persona-esque system where the day is split up into segments, and you choose between things like deepening your bonds with party members (which unlocks special abilities and items) or going to dungeons. The only issue here is that there is [i]far[/i] too much to do and you'll have to pick and choose what you want to focus on. Oh, and my other gripe is that stats and weapon effects are not explained, and it can be rather unclear if a given weapon effect is positive or negative.

The art though... personally I'd give a hard pass on it unless you like 'em young, which I do not. Body proportions are actually more realistic though, which again could be a good or bad thing depending on what you want from it. Also, focusing on the sexy times comes at the cost of doing the other things like deepening bonds with party members. But if you're one of those twisted individuals that play H-rpgs and try mostly to [i]avoid[/i] the sexy times, then there is still a whole lot of game here. Is this the new Persona? The patch can be obtained from the publisher's website. 

This game is something I enjoy because it is very similar to the persona games. So as a quick review: If you like the persona games you'll like this. If not, well, then don't buy this. The combat is practically identivcval, just watered down and a lower quality, but basicly the same nonetheless. It also has the confidant system and the system of days and whatnot. 

7/10. Get this if you like H-JRPGs and or like persona. i hate limited time games, but the art was worth Persona but H-RPG. Recommend save editing after some point because grinding isnt fun and that's not what you're there for. Story is fun and other side content is too. Worth Base and Sale price. Liked this one but hated the small screen. Didn't know there was a command to fullscreen it. (Alt + enter for those wondering.)

[hr][/hr]
[+]   The art is decent, it won't wow you but it's pleasant to look at. The tags are also good but the scenes themselves can sometimes feel a bit static.

[+]   The life-sim is one of the best parts of the game. It is quite engrossing to carefully juggle your everyday activities with your other-world dungeon-crawling.

[+/-]   The combat is definitely better then most of these types of games due to the Persona-like one-more system. However the dungeon design is pretty bland.

[+/-]   The story is fairly interesting but that's because it's pretty much just Persona, mostly P4.

[-]   The game runs on an older version of RPG-Maker so the play experience can feel a bit rough around the edges at times.

If you save often and don't mind the crashes - I would recommend it. Refunded üëç I am 32 years old.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Build your own path to the exit and use special tiles to keep your Bytes safe against a dynamic AI that tries to counter your actions.,"BYTES is an interesting take on the fairly unknown reverse tower defense genre. The level variety and structure of the game provide a solid amount of replay-ability. The story and dialogue elements of the game also greatly contribute to its overall complexity. The wave customization features are a phenomenal way to personalize units and add a healthy amount of variety to the gameplay. It also features a fantastically thematic soundtrack that  enhances the overall experience of the game. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fresh tower defense experience. Tower Offense? Anti-Tower Defense? Reverse Tower Defense? What ever this genre is called, SIGN ME UP. This game is very fun and is worth checking out to any tower defense lover. If you are okay with the fact that the art style is simply little shapes making their way through a circuit board type world, you will love this game. This is a really fun and well made game!! There's that element of strategizing and planning that makes it a fun challenge to get through each level. The learning process is straightforward and well laid out too.
I like that there's a story/background built into the world, it adds an extra layer of motivation and satisfaction of progressing in the game. I also love the visuals and design <3 
I definitely recommend, it's worth getting it! I thought this game was pretty fun. Never really played Tower defense games much, but I've definitely enjoyed this so far. Something different around the Tower Defense genre with greater emphasis around strategy/puzzle.

You really have to think your way around this one and make sure you carefully read the tutorial - I flashed through and struggled for a while. (a 22 minute Youtube video was a big help).

Don't say it often, but enjoying the sound options. Bytes is a refreshing twist on the traditional tower defense genre. Here, the player constructs a path while a cunning AI places the defensive towers. This ingenious role reversal offers a new strategic challenge that is both engaging and Compelling.
The gameplay is wonderfully intuitive and exceptionally layered, requiring careful planning and adaptability around the AI's moves. The visuals and immersive sound design also add to the game's allure, creating a richly detailed and captivating experience.
In summary, it‚Äôs a standout game that combines innovation with strategic depth. It is an excellent choice for any gamer seeking a fresh and challenging experience.

There's custom modded missions in this game that play better than this and you don't have to pay for them, even if this is cheap(frequently on sale for a few USD) I wouldn't buy this again.

This is the best DLC I have played so far in Arma III (haven't gotten around to all of them, but I definitely recommend this over things like Contact.

I thoroughly enjoyed replaying missions in different roles. The infantry missions did get a little annoying.

The highlight of the pack is the mini backhoe loader, is it functional? Can be used for small tasks. Although the back boom of the backhoe loaders is extensible, it is unfortunately fixed in the centre. Cannot sideshift right or left. That's the part I'm going to criticize. Apart from that, these vehicles are already in the game with different brands. (except mini backhoe) Mini dumper case can turn right or left, that is functional.

‚ùáÔ∏è Female protagonist / Great positive trait
Shika is a sharp minded one, always calm, serious and thoughtful, cutie, pleasure to play as her.

*Ô∏è‚É£ Full female cast / Positive trait
Our comrades Kotori and Nami are skillful, strong and cute, yet there is no background / development to them. [spoiler]They love Shika, Shika loves them, I love this perfect harem team.[/spoiler].

‚ùáÔ∏è Visual style / Great positive trait
Of course from global point of view anime style is top notch, but compared to other VNs I can see some broken proportions and shapes in characters, still there isn't anything critical and style looks just okay.

Shika does really cares about her friends and everytime says yes when they invite her to spend some hot time together, so we will see bunch of erotic happenings. However there is not so much romantic dialogues between team, despite certainly having feelings towards each other, they are more focused on events. And ohhhh how much Akane drives me mad with her speeches and actions, but we will quite talk heart to heart with her to come to resolution.

Scenes themselves not impressive, neither hot... and there is no detailed depiction of girl's crotches and barely any textual description for any actions, and overall scenes aren't long, so this is more Featuring The Boobs‚Ñ¢ only. Yet all 5 are quite enjoyable.
There is few ecchi, and on CGs we can quite often see translucence clothes, but that doesn't make me happy: nipples are drawn not to my taste and other parts do not drawn at all.

*Ô∏è‚É£ Story & events / Small Positive trait
I liked the idea by being chased by a mysterious dangerous opponent, in the same time digging information about her in detective manner. And there were couple of cool mindgames and tricks, not very complicated, but I liked them. Reading will take 3-4 hours.
Battles are boring: sometimes girls are obliteration machines with perfect reflexes, and sometimes get caught in stupid situations. There is a little or no description how exactly do they fight and what techniques they use, and as overall there is no many detailed explanations of happenings.

üí¢ Setting & worldbuilding / Small negative trait
It is space western, setting just a decoration, story does not use it at all. There is no anything original, yet game pushes in your face cloying and generic space sci-fi every time, I didn't like it. Cosmos and nanotechs are not a joke, so take it seriously. At least there were mentioned Thermal Signatures.

‚ú¥Ô∏è Story progression / Neutral trait
It is almost kinetic, you can make 21 choices which will have no influence (only on your meta reputation as a detective).

‚ú¥Ô∏è Visual design / Neutral trait
Do not see anything interesting here, as I said, for this setting everything is so generic.

*Ô∏è‚É£ Visual quality / Positive trait
Drawing and image quality is good. This is both for visual design and quality: the way how nipples are drawn here makes me sad.

*Ô∏è‚É£ Animations / Small positive trait
There is some characters movement / facial expression changes on screen to make things a bit more lively.

*Ô∏è‚É£ Language / Positive trait
English is good here, with enough advanced structures, but there is no any sophisticated words (which is sad to me, I like them), so you can read this fluently.

‚ùî VFX / None

Add at least some female squishy sounds...

‚ú¥Ô∏è Backgrounds / Neutral trait
Looks like exactly what you will expect from your [i]generic[/i] space cruiser. Drawn good.

‚ú¥Ô∏è Music / Neutral trait
Soundbank is small and lame, tunes are weak. Better they found some free music on the interwebs.

*Ô∏è‚É£ Interface / Positive trait
Design is good, font is okay. Does not interfere to see arts.

‚ùáÔ∏è Engine / Great positive trait
It is Ren'Py. Skips fast, every tool for VN is here. You can unpack assets easily. I am still experiencing problems with switching off the fullscreen.


Digression: This is my first game from Sakura series (and I will touch only such ones, where you can see your MC or you are female, and, how fortunately, every Sakura with yuri and full-female cast passes and everyone without does not, what a turn of events with imaginary proportions). I bought to the test only this one, which has the lowest score (79% to notice) among all yuri Sakuras, and it was at least enjoyable, so I think it is safe for me to buy all 18 of these games (MMO 1-3+Extra, Gamer 1-2, Sadist, Cupid, Space, Dungeon, Fantasy, Fox  Adventure, Knight 1-3, Forest Girls 1-3. I checked only up until Alien 2), considering their laughable price during discount [spoiler]especially in region with all the time lowest prices[/spoiler] and what seems that every one of them has trading cards.
But I am thinking that I will not have enough mental determination to write yet 17 of these big shitposts. Man in space with markiplier part 3 is a lot different from the last two parts but a welcome change. 69/80 would ask mark to play again That is one spicy meat ball, especially with the R18 patch. Even excluding the H scenes, the story was actually pretty good for how basic it was. Unlike a lot of H games, the characters actually felt a bit intelligent. I'd recommend this game more than other games of the same target audience.
Small warning: No Steam Cloud Save Sync. Cum for the lewds, stay for the heartwarming tale of bounty hunting in space. It was ok... ‚†Ñ‚†Ñ‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚†ò‚°ø‚¢õ‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ß‚¢ª‚£ø‚£ø‚†É‚†∏‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚†Ñ‚†Ñ‚†Ñ‚†Ñ‚†Ñ

2188820,The shelter of patient,game,False,"21 Nov, 2022","Adventure, Indie, Simulation","This game is a 3D based simulation horror game and has a high graphic level. Help the protagonist, a journalist, explore a mysterious mansion in the mountains. Of course you shouldn't die.","I'm always reticent about leaving negative reviews because I know how much effort it takes to make and publish a game, but I'm too disappointed not to this time. Even if it costs less than ‚Ç¨1, it's still money spent on something that's very poorly made.
The biggest issue is that the game doesn't seem to have an end: once you enter the building there's no way to exit. I've tried to inspect all the rooms (that are very limited in number) multiple times with no results. A couple of ways to escape are hinted through some notes/observations from the character but there's no actual way to use them, mostly because once you collect something in a room you lose it as soon as you exit that room.
Then there's a long list of technical flaws: missing colliders on the fireplaces, bad lighting management (some areas are too dark even with the headlight on), frustrating character controller (you can only go forward and you rotate with the camera, so you can't for example move sideways and it's very uncomfortable, especially knowing that you could die), confusing buttons (why should I use F to interact with some things and X to interact with some other things?), poor sintax (some texts have mistakes), wrong scaling of the building in the first scene (it's way too small comparing to the character and the surrounding environment), very little accessibility (the texts that say what buttons to press are white and if you have your headlight on you can't read them in some areas, but if you turn the headlight off you can't see anything at all since it's all pitch black; also, the cromatic aberration it's maybe too much and you can't turn it off unless you enter a room -if you manage to, it's very difficult to understand what you're seeing), unnecessarly repeated assets (I'm all for optimization, but all the libraries are exactly the same, it takes 30 seconds to switch the order of the books on a modeling software). I don't know if I'm missing anything else but it's already too much so I'm stopping here.
Again, if it wasn't for the fact that I spent actual money on this I wouldn't have left a review at all, but here we are. I'm lost. Is this game broken? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kLKwCJ4-k",-0.1710961091753775

The power of Shakti allows you to recover Mp through sexual intercourse, and when your climax gauge is at its maximum, your Hp and Mp are fully recovered.","Looking forward to your next work.
Ê¨°Âõû‰Ωú„Å´ÊúüÂæÖ„Åó„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ I don't know what to say, other than the game was absolute trash.

1. Incomplete translations strewn throughout the dialogue for the English translation. Tons of paragraphs and names left in the original Japanese(?) language.

2. Story is rather dry with all of the data-dumping during each story segment, which makes the dialogue hard to follow and not seem natural.

3. Combat is similar to a bullet-hell game, but they failed at that. Most enemies can't do much damage to you. Very clunky controls and movement system, along with rather terrible combat abilities and ""skills"".

4. Graphics are rather craptastic for the game play portion, but somewhat decent during the cutscenes and persistent CG. Additionally, rather few sex scenes for a porn game.

Overall, not even worth the discounted price I got off of Steam. Absolutely either avoid buying, or get a refund if possible. Let me be brief. The game looks like ass, uses defaultish rpg maker soundtracks, and the gameplay is buggy as all get out. The translations are extremely confusing
However, the plot is very enthralling and some of the most fun I've enjoyed playing a janky ass game that feels like its from the 90s.  I recommend picking up and playing this game. Its funny and fun enough to enjoy.

Also its porn. I 100%'d the game in about 3 hours, you can probably do it quicker. I feel I got more than my moneys worth with this. Straightforward, mindless game-play and mechanics. The adult content is a bit bizarre. I just think it's neat. It's short and stands out from other adult offerings on Steam. I almost feel ashamed that I spent 8 bucks on this game. I mean from the preview it looks like a good game but after about 45 minutes its not worth your time anymore. The game play is good, but I figured the game would be harder and it really was a breeze. 4 hours later I was done but at first the story seemed to be pretty good and worth the time but after the 4th chapter I started just clicking through the story because of all the SUPER poor english translations. Translation for this game went to the lowest bidder and it shows. So the story is very hard to understand because HE and SHE are used incorrectly almost 95% of the time. So reading and understanding it was an absolutely CHORE!!  The cut scenes are lazy, if they were animated then this game would be better but they are still images. It's kind of funny when you play the game the animations  for Z and V (the names are horrible so Z and V is what I use) on the left hand side of the screen are perfect. Even some of the cut scenes have some 3d imagery mixed in but they could have made them fully animated. This game has a lot of promise it just so easy and so cheesy at the same time. 2 bucks for this game would be fine but 8 bucks is outrageous!! Bullet hell - Yes
Cutscenes - Bad
Mechanics - Alright
Sexual Content - Should have just did pictures because the animation and place of animation is terrible

[b]REINCARNATION ASURA ZALANDARA[/b] Journey of carnage and redemption is a lewd bullet hell about a cursed king and his wife that must save the world from total annihilation.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Dodge baddies and bullets and beat bosses. There are six stages total, each culminating to a boss fight. Each stage begins and ends with long visual novel portions. At least a third of the game is reading -- but you can choose to toggle all cutscenes before starting a stage. By collecting ""Zeptomachines"" (dropped by foes), you are able to upgrade your base stats and unlock new weapons. Weapons are fueled by ""magic"", which passively regenerates. Your regeneration can be enhanced via sexual intercourse, and when you [b]climax[/b] all of your stats are fully restored!

[h1]Story[/h1]
The Anantal Ring, a network of orbital weapons has gone haywire. Dubbed the ""Black Carnage"", hundreds of thousands of unmanned drones have been unleased upon the world, along with nine GigaFlameMachines (or ""False God Machines""). The Black Carnage isn't just some technological hiccup; in fact, humanity is [i]chump change[/i] in the face of what's at stake. Armed with the mysterious Spear of Mara and his devoted wife, Zarandala is the world's only hope. Like the Carnage, he and his beloved Vrinda are more than what meets the eye.

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
The titlescreen is messy. There's text everywhere, and I haven't a clue what the ""hukkatu"" button does (which is apparently nothing). Though the art isn't ""AAA"", I did enjoy the overall composition; I feel as though I'm entering a dramatic RPG (which isn't far from the actual game). From ""Configuration"", you may adjust audio, display and resolution preferences. There is no gallery to review strictly CGs, but you are able to replay cutscenes (which may contain adult content) via ""Event"" (after starting the game). The English isn't well translated, but you can generally understand what's going on. Misspellings are commonplace.

[b]- The Goods -[/b]
There are a handful of sex scenes, each comprised of dialogue and a handful of CGs. The artwork is okay, but censorship is a major buzzkill. I found the lewd artwork to be amateurish. I didn't see any major rape scenes, but there was one I remember that was abnormally gory. There are a few scenes with pregnancy, and one with childbirth. One of the core mechanics of gameplay is that you recharge magic via intercourse; however, there is only one animation to showcase this mechanic (or [i]two[/i] if you count the pregnant variant). Overall, I found the sexual content to be underwhelming.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Wait for a sale and updates. This game is [i]grossly unbalanced,[/i] but I still had fun. There is no reason to fight outside of boss battles, and boss battles are stupid-easy. There are a few overpowered weapons that can be used to breeze through the game, and strategy typically boils down to ""mash attack"". Much of the game is reading, but the English and storytelling fall flat. Not only that, but many of the story scenes are just black backgrounds with text! But at the end of the day, [b]REINCARNATION ASURA ZALANDARA Journey of carnage and redemption[/b] is a promising title. I think with some added features and general balance, this could become a challenging and interesting title. But until then, I'd hold off on buying this game.

So if you are expecting to play PvP then don't bother, but this game does also have a PvE where you (and possibly a friend or 2 assuming you have friends) get to team up and fight against enemy's and capture zones and all that stuff. I just wish it had an actual playerbase :( Fantastic movement, great combat, and large-scale battles. Too bad you won't experience any of it considering there isn't a single human playing this game. The developers didn't even bother populating lobbies with bots, and the PvE mode has received zero updates since day one of launch. Whether they make it free to play or lower the price, whatever solution they come up with at this point will be too little, too late. Out of hundreds of games. This is by far my most regrettable and disappointing purchase. ok... this could have been a fun game but it was marketed wrong and came out unfinished. and it was almost 30$ when i bought it... what these guys should do is take it off for a year, fix bugs, work on marketing and offer lots of beta for free. this could be a fun game to pop into and play and it could have a constant player base of like 10k if things go well. Super fun but I wish the stuff I had from the Playtest transferred to the actual game. Disclaimer: This game is obviously early in development so all that follows is subject to change
The concept of the game is refreshing and fun at first, but when every lobby is the same 20 or so people with one or two absolute virgins running the pathfinder and spamming you from their shield it gets pretty damn infuriating. In addition, the spawns of both players and supply drops don't take enemy locations into account so I very often end up spawning in front of an enemy.

AMD Ryzem 7 1700 eight core processor
Radeon RX 570 A great game with friends. I paid 25 dollars for this game and now it's free? Absolutely embarrassing. I received no compensation for this. it dosent work with the remotes that came with my rift Well I'm bored, so I am reviewing this game. Capsa is a social game made with multiplayer in mind, like your normal MMO. It is made in the Unreal Engine (more on that later) and was on Steam Greenlight when that was a thing. I actually backed this on the service as I was impressed with what it was, especially compared to some of the... other stuff. And now I have it, was it worth it? Well, let's find out!

Gameplay: There isn't much here, as the game isn't meant to be this insane anime super game. For what this game is supposed to be like, it does it well. You have a few things to do, like walking, climbing on specific surfaces and swimming in LAVA!!!! jk, water. Like I said, it's simple, and since more stuff is planned, there is something to keep coming back for, especially online. Does it well, but it might seem bare bones to others, and I agree that more can be added.

Graphics and Presentation: Remember when I said this game was made in UE4? Well, that affects me because Epic Games knows nothing about optimization, but this game has better optimization than others. I cannot experience full graphics due to my potato PC, but looking at pics shows this game's beauty with times of day, nice lighting, and so much more. I wish I had a better PC though. A cool thing is that you can customize your character like crazy. Both male and female have specific options (although Kirbyfan45 law states that female is the true choice). Requesting clothing items might also be a thing, but PLEASE don't ask for nudity! I saw someone on the Steam community actually ask for that. Don't be him. I cannot fully experience this for myself, but if you can, you'll like it.

Sound and Soundtrack: Under normal circumstances, this game does not have either. Sound effects are scarce, only used for water, footsteps, and entering the customization area. That is kinda weird. This game will fail in this area if it were not for one thing: custom songs! By finding music areas like DJ stands, you can insert the URL of any song you know (or copy and paste it) in the text box. This allows custom OST, which is cool. That helps a lot if you can't tell!

Replayability: Well, this is a social type game, with online multiplayer in mind. The replayability comes from what you like. You can explore the areas and find secrets like the 126 hidden items  or go online and make new friends (or enemies). I didn't play online yet, but I might, and you can apparently make your own servers, which is neat. So I guess in this sense you make your own replayability, I dunno.

A fun fact: One of the game's developers, Vetron, is actually on my friends list, and is a cool guy/gal. Vetron answered my questions on the Greenlight page and helped me with the graphics by improving optimization. I recommend befriending Vetron. His profile is in the link provided.

Final Thoughts: After looking everything over and from my experiences, I feel this game deserves this score. However, you may have different experiences and thoughts, and disagree with me, and that is fine, everyone has opinions. However, I think this game deserves a 7.1/10 with a side of some cat ears. It definitely has a certain audience in mind for the enjoyment factor. I am not fully in this area, and UE4 being poorly optimized, if, at all, might have hurt this game in the long run. This is a PC exclusive from Steam Greenlight, however, it is not entirely impossible for the game to get ports on other consoles. Skullgirls got ports, and so did Freedom Planet, and I feel this game deserves a PS4 port as a good version of Atom Universe. If you have a good enough PC, than I recommend it, otherwise, you should play the waiting game. very love ly game you can custom full your charakter  and the landscape is awesome the game play is very good + the controller is very good playable  grapichs veryy nice i can play  on 60 fps in one woed amazing game Right now from what I see on my schedule, there's normally 3-8 people on. There may be more on when I'm off doing weird stuff.  The TWO developers Vetron and Carly are awesome, and actually talk with the players.  Now then let me make a strong note here, this game is Early Access. Which, if you don't know what that means, I suggest you take the time to read the Disclaimer that is present on the store page. The devs are activly putting up fixes and patching issues.   So far players are nice, if not a tad ADHD but hell who the fuck isn't nowadays? LOL.   The graphics are well done, the islands have plenty of flora, you can ride horses, and mildly customize little houses.  

That being said. THIS IS A SOCIAL PLATFORM. As in, not a standard modern game. There's no death/drowning/falldmg/Any of that.  It's all about talking, getting to know people, looking good, and having a relaxing time. And honestly if you want to take a break from ARMA3, Dark Souls, or Star Citizen; looking for something peaceful and social based, then this may be worth your time to look into.  


So to wrap up. Good graphics, okay character customization, HORSES!, No Lords Of Cinder, No bitchy significant other, boooty fo dayz, and of course it actually runs pretty well. 




Note: Because this is in Early Access, patches may at times break things known or unknown. That is how game development and Murphy's Law works. But the devs here listen and do their best. That is all Terrible! 
Dead as all hell. 
Customization are totally whack and limited. 
I played this for 15 minutes before I demanded a refund.
I can see they were trying to go for that Second Life vibe, but sadly it didn't work out for them.
This game should be free. Even then it would be dead with no one on any of the servers. Let me preface this review by saying that this isn't my first social game. Quite the opposite really, I've been playing them since the early days, and I try to play all of them that I can. I prefer to have as many clothing options as I can in one of these, but what's here is solid and customizable. I've tried to find something wrong, something that they could improve on, but haven't found anything yet. Despite being only a couple months old at the time of this writing, Capsa is one of the most promising social MMO's I've played in a long time. I enjoy it more than the PS4 ones.

You can see in the screen caps and such that this is a gorgeous world, but what you can't see is that the currently small but active community is welcoming, helpful, and fun to be around. You can't see that the servers are incredibly stable and there's almost no glitches to be found in Capsa. You can't see that all of this was done by two people, who are always at work on this game and who are happy to answer questions or problems people have. You can't see the fact that this game doesn't do the whole microtransactions thing, and once you've bought the game you get everything from now on. You can't see that it's quite a bit fun to search the island on foot or horseback, climb the rocks, chase a friend through a maze, and then chill in front of a giant screen playing a youtube video you like while you discuss with others the stuff you did that day in Capsa.

But after spending as of now 10 hours in this world, I can safely say that you should see all of this for yourself. If you have enjoyed virtual worlds or social games in the past or want to try a good one out to see what the fuss is about, this one's my suggestion to you. It's worth the money, that money goes to supporting a tiny, dedicated indie team, and I really look forward to seeing what else these devs decide to add to this already awesome world.",0.0851121753246753
896744,FSX Steam Edition: Cessna¬Æ C400 Corvalis TT Add-On,dlc,False,"29 Nov, 2018",Simulation,The C400 Corvalis TT has been designed to further push the limits of what can be achieved and delivers super high quality detail to satisfy even the most demanding private pilot‚Äôs needs.,"The rudder does not work. You cannot steer the plane on the ground. But it's a great plane  I am loviing it. I liked this add on by Alabeo.  I'm a real world pilot with G1000 endorsement.  For those of you that are looking for a plane that has a very good modeling of the G1000 this is the plane for you.  Although, it does have a glitch in the software when loading, but I have notified Alabeo about that glitch.  Hopefully, they will get a patch soon. Wow, this is one fast little 4 seater! Really quick and can soar at relatively high altitudes with great range. The lighting is especially nice at night, and the cabin overall is sweet. Don‚Äôt worry about having to use the differential braking to steer. It turned me off before I bought this plane, but I quickly adapted and just love my C400. Get it, especially if you catch it on sale! The disadvantage of this aircraft is that the automatic driving of the rudder will be out of control. I pretty much start FSX anytime I play, in my Corvalis. I notice alot of people dislike the steering, but in real world, that is exactly what it is like to control these airplanes on the ground. It is all differential braking. The displays have so much information, you can actually get sidetracked from the primary reason we fly... the view, because your too busy fooling around with all the things your G1000 can do. It really is a joy to fly. On take off, watch your trim carefully and constantly adjust it in the climb or you will find yourself at 25+ degrees nose up in less than 3 seconds. My only complaints, and they are VERY VERY minor, are the angry bumble bee sound the engine makes when your at max power, and the fuel system. I like my sim to be as close to the real thing as possible, so I noticed that when I don't manually select the left tank before I start flying, the engine will draw fuel from BOTH tanks, equally throughout the flight without any need for switching tanks during the flight to maintain the weight and balance. Real world- this is not correct. As with the Cirrus SR22, you start on the left tank, and you don't let the imbalance between the 2 exceed 10 gallons or it starts making for an interesting flight. But that is seriously all I have to complain about. other than that, the speed brakes are a godsend to keep you on glideslope, maintain that rudder control too keep yourself coordinated and you will get just as hooked on this plane as I am. This one is a very good aircraft to get, outside looks very good, inside is also good. all systems seem to work ok.
lighting and dimming is sick (good)
The PDU is very clear and true, so is the MDU which has lots of info to look at I.E. map, engine management etc, delve deeper to look at a vast number of check lists ( to tick off) covering all aspect of this great little aircraft.
Only two very small issues .
One, the steering is by using the differential  brakes. if useing a Joy stick turn say right and hold the brake and she'll turn on a Dime, add a bit of throttle she'll turn tighter, its just getting used to it.
Second point, when the Engine is at idle the engine has a bit of throb, but when at high speed the sound becomes something like an electric hand whisk. its not an issue, it just lose's its powerful engine sound.
10/10 Absolutely amazing modern aircraft, and nice + functional FSX model...Really great to see 'Kit Airplane' innovations from EAA.org ect are now incorporated in GA aircraft in modern times :)  Like the side-stick controls from Velocity XL, and features from the Q200, high hp engines, composite materials ect, also really nice models to add to your FSX collection. ( should be a sale on these aswell hopefully in Feb ) KTNP 29Palms really nice airport addon aswell ( only $5 or so ) for these planes for flight to KSAN San Diego and back...the immersion and Airport GA activity ect,absolutely stunning.  Can tell modern younger engineers thought about the ergonomics for this airplane.  Light controls front center consol (strange to get used too )  now second nature to me, seperate light controls far away from more critical ( fall out of the sky ) systems etc.  Note plane does not have retractable gear, and Drag penatly is actually not that severe vs reliability gained, why most GA aircraft do this these days, but would have been nice for sim model to include an  immaginaryRG model aswell :)..Overall you will really enjoy this plane if you like advanced GA aircraft, but buy the VELO Velocity XL at same time or before you purchase this one, has RG and is faster.  Onsale the C400 is the better deal.  https://youtu.be/dwShFFzaSag [h1] Cessna C400 Corvalis TT Add-On Product Review [/h1]

Seriously this plane is one of the best plane I bought, all that perfect details, sound, beautiful glass cockpit, animated pilot, etc. only some weird problem I encountered so far: First thing is the sound of the engine is extremely lound, you can prove that by changing your view to an AI airplane (which stay like 40+ NM away from you) you can still hear the sound of your own engine, does it make sense? of course not. The other thing is this plane cannot use steering wheel, to turn the plane during taxi I usually add some thrust and then the differential break (default NUMPAD * and NUMPAD -) to turn left or right.

Worth my hard-earned money

I am currently taking a yacht skipper course, and this simulator has been an absolute game-changer for me. It provides an incredibly realistic sailing experience, allowing me to practice navigation, maneuvering, and different sailing conditions from the comfort of my home.

The graphics and physics are highly accurate, making it feel like you're actually out on the water. It has helped me build confidence and improve my skills before heading out to sail in real life. I highly recommend this simulator to anyone learning to sail or looking to sharpen their skills! Usefull tool to learn for beginners. I learned a lot at least. Never sailed in real life but I`ve seen a lot of videos and at least finally I can understand what are they talking about ""jib sheet, gybing...etc""

The game is a bit blank and the terrain is knd of ugly. The island could help some trees and road and things to be a bit more visually appeling. More boats would be nice too as well ship interiors. Missions? Collect this box and bring into there...etc.

Again Good learning tool, Ok game, bit overpriced (¬£30). Cheper than a real a boat. Buy it cheap or if you want to learn. Learning how to sail with this is fun and easy. Being able to repeat lessons at my leisure until I'm comfortable with them. Great beginner learning tool and easy experimentation with concepts. Helped me build my sailing intuition and knowledge base. Looking forward to comparing it to real sailing when the time comes. I have been playing this game parallel to learning to sail. This game has certainly made learning fun and easier. It gives a good overview of what you need to know and provides insight into what to expect and what will be required of you as a sailor when the time comesüòâ If you're into sailing, this sim is good to practice techniques that you can implement on a real boat without worrying about hazards and consequences of being at sea. Very fun and accurate. This was of massive help before I got IRL sailing cert. It's much cheaper to properly learn the ropes and run a boat into a mooring several times here than it is on a real boat :D Best sailing simulator I've found.  Enjoying it very much. Great way to learn sailing information in many languages! I played through in English and am starting go through in Spanish. This is by far the most immersive and detailed sailing simulation I have found.  Most of the VR sailing is very clunky and does not seem to have enough fidelity to use a halyard or release a cleat.  I really enjoy this game/simulator.",0.21686696900982616
2636910,Moonbase Lambda,game,False,"6 Mar, 2025","Action, Indie","The base is silent‚Äîas if abandoned. The air feels heavy, and oxygen is running out. In the shadows, something stirs. You can hear it, but you can‚Äôt see it. Every step echoes in the darkness, every sound makes your pulse race. Survive. Escape. Before time runs out.","This is basically an old game. In 2015 a game was released called ""Monstrum"", if you played/know this game, i can tell you that Moonbase Lambda is Monstrum on the moon and with a smaller map. If you dont, imagine runnig through dark rooms and a monster tries to kill you. The differences between Moonbase Lambda and Monstrum are the pixel fliter, the dumber and nearly blind Monster as well as a way to escape the monster once it catches you. I would call this game the young brother of Monstrum. I recommend this for the price of 4,79‚Ç¨ i keep dying Fun game, cool aesthetic, and decent replay value.  Completing all the achievements was a bit challenging, but pretty fun to do.  You'll like this game if you enjoy Alien Isolation, Monstrum, etc.  The AI in my experience tends to camp around the player really tightly sometimes which isn't bad, but can make the game drag on longer than normal.  The monster seems to like walking back n forth in the area it last heard the player, but will only move a few steps not giving the player a chance to run or sneak away.  I feel like this could be more fun to deal with if the random items you can pick up around map that can be thrown would cause noise to temporarily lure the monster towards it making a cool dynamic between managing random items that can be picked up/thrown and glowsticks.  Overall worth the money and is pretty fun spooky as hell Crazy good at building atmosphere and generating tension. Scary and short. Loved this, that's all I want to say about it. Go try it for yourself and don't get caught~ A spiritual successor to Alien: Isolation which boasts several impressive quality of life improvements, including quicker scenarios, a much smaller hard drive footprint, improved visuals that better emphasize the lo-fi ""retrofuture"" vibe (and immersive bleakness) of the original Alien film, and - perhaps most importantly - no flamethrower that lets you simply bully the monster into a corner. I also really liked the musical cue when the monster is on your trail, leaving you wanting to check every direction in dread, as you know death is already approaching... or just immediately bolt like a rabbit, even if you might blindly pick the worst possible direction and die like the braindead alien food that you were always fated to become. A promising debut for this indie developer. I cant say that AI is well written, and the theme/shader is need a little rework. But game and the idea is really great and its very fun! Definitely worth giving a try. [h1]The moonbase Lambda is quiet and dark.

 Players will have to complete several objectives to escape from the darkness. By turning on the generator, you can check the base map, which is the main hint. There are several ways to escape, and you can turn the flashlight on and off to avoid being caught by monsters, and you can escape from the monsters once with an item called a flare. The concept of a player being left alone trying to escape from the moon base is clear, and it seems like a good game because it presents clear objectives from the beginning, such as restoring communication and attaching batteries to the spaceship. I think it would be a good playground for speedrunners.",0.0010364145658263294
3463900,Luminous Project,game,False,"21 Feb, 2025","Casual, Indie","A national project where six girls play melodies to save the Earth. This is a simple rhythm game where you press keys in time with falling notes. Play through a variety of songs and gather the light of hope, Luminous!","Okay, I want to preface that while I don't necessarily recommend this game I also don't wanna write it off entirely. I am, at the time of writing this review, still capable to refund but I won't. I plan to play this more and keep it. 

I am still choosing to not recommend it due to its flaws, though.

First of all the characters are clearly AI generated art. Now, I don't care as characters isn't really what I play a rhythm game for anyway. But, I just feel they could have put in some effort to fix up the art a bit after generating it. This is what I do for OCs I create (I am a roleplayer). And considering they use this art for profit and not even personal use like I do, the fact they put in less effort, is a pretty bad look. 

The game offers 120 songs in total which is a good library. All songs I've played so far and browsed through, are ones I've never heard. They're likely royalty free, I am not sure, but the good thing is that most of them sound pretty pleasant and I like that they're not very well known to me. Cuz after 120 diff rhythm games or so, it is nice not to run into the same songs most of them use, over and over again. (Though I can never grow tired of Brainpower LOL) 

The charting seems okay if not a little too easy even on hard mode. The playing field is a bit too wide in my opinion. Most vertical scrolling rhythm games have much smaller lanes granting a much better overview. I wish it was the case in this game, too. Or the option to make it less wide. It would be a lot more comfortable for the player. Of course, the notes do not play the actual music when hit, they just give a clicky sound. You can lower the volume on it to the point of not having it be heard at all, as some prefer.

Another glaring issue is that the game does not offer calibration, neither for sound nor visuals. And while the charting seems okay, as I said, I do feel that, to stay in line with the music, I have to hit the note a bit later than I feel I should based on the visuals. It really feels like I am always cutting it really close to missing the note, as it's almost off the board already by the time I'd hit it to make sense with the music. And if I do not hit it where it makes sense with the music, but solely based on the visuals, it doesn't feel good cuz it'll be off-key. 

I'd say the game is still worth it if you're a rhythm game fanatic like me who loves playing through a bunch of them. Especially since it has a decent sized song library and is not that expensive, especially if on sale. 

But if you just want a cheap rhythm game to start with, then there's many others that are a better choice for little money. I personally recommend MUSNYX as a solid choice. Super cheap, tons of songs, visually better, songs are key-sounded with the actual songs, and you can pick between 4 or 6 key.  It's cheaper than this game and much higher quality than this one, too.",0.10841145833333332

It's essentially Pokemon with girls, with combat directly inspired by Helen's Mysterious Castle. Lots of attention to detail, all the characters are cute, ton of events and text to go through. Pixel animations are fantastic.
Hope more people will discover this hidden gem.

In case you weren't aware, this is an EROGE and a patch is required.

kinda meh too basic of gameplay and gets grindy Thanks to some guy who told me how to patch 10/10 game ""Sexcellent!"" Tiddies and perhaps also booty Nice.
But I wanna play Pokemon now.

Game is honestly a very tedious grind for scenes and unlocks.
If you get burnout from that, fortunately, there is a cheat that helps you out.
But to be fair, I myself had a blast with this game, despite the grind. 
And the Monsters and Scenes are very well designed for a Pixel-Art Game. It's all very cute but waaay too repetitive.
Also the lack of volume and brightness options are annoying. It really makes enjoying it difficult when your eardrums are being blown out and you're being flash-banged every time someone climaxes.",0.05372960372960377
538760,Zaccaria Pinball - VR,dlc,False,"17 Oct, 2016","Casual, Free To Play, Indie, Simulation, Sports",Experience the atmosphere of Zaccaria Pinball in Virtual Reality.,"Obviously works for others but for me it has an issue with CTD now and again in VR, refunded. The choice for VR Pinball.

You're not gonna recognize any of the boards, unless you're big on pinball, I guess.

Myself, I just thought it would be fun and funny to have a pinball sim because it's like a hundred pinball machines but in a virtual space.

It really delivers! I think the team did a good job with the IPs that they had, especially when they put all those remix variants together for each of the eras of pinball. This VR mode might actually be the most essential thing a pinball fan can find on Steam and one of the best examples of how VR can enhance an existing genre without feeling like a gimmick. I love pinball in all its forms and I've tried just about every big pinball platform on steam, and while I like them all the one thing that's always a hassle is the fact that very long, very flat Pinball tables don't really display well on very horizontal, very widescreen computer monitors. There have been a number of workarounds over the years and while I can generally find a playable camera angle, trying this VR mode out was a revelation. The scale is perfect, it's like you're actually standing in front of a pinball table and the fact that you can just turn your head or dart your eyes to follow where the ball is and look at what you're doing is so simple and so obvious but a massive game changer for the playability and enjoyability of digital pinball. 

There [i]are[/i] other solutions for seeing the whole table that have come up over the years, if you've got a monitor on a swivel you [i]could[/i] do that, or you could even get one of those virtual pinball machines that has the shape and size of the real thing, but a with a screen, but that's such a massive space and money investment for something that basically does one thing. In my opinion simply playing in a VR headset is far more convenient, especially if you've got a Quest 3 where you can just plug it in with a single cable (or airlink) and forgo all the mess and setup of something like the Index.

My only complaint with the experience, and it is unfortunately a pretty noticeable one, is that if you get an achievement, the ""Achievement Unlocked"" window is not only massive, but also covers up your flippers which is kind of insane. I'm not sure if there's an in-game setting to change how that pops up but it's the one flaw in an otherwise stellar experience. I really want to love this game in VR, and almost do.....almost!  I think it just needs tweaking as it will be playing flawlessly at 90fps then suddenly drop to 30-40 then back up.  It takes away from the enjoyment.  I keep tabs on my rig and the GPU and CPU never go above 50%.  The game looks beautiful however and the physics are very realistic.  

Please optimise a little more, as I'm sure it's not my rig.

First of all, [B]don't buy this stand-alone[/b], buy the bundle, even if (actually especially if) you already own the tables, as the tables you own get knocked off the price but the significant bundle discount remains, even if this VR mode is the only item left.

That said, the experience works, though the reduced resolution (at least on my Rift) is both noticeable and impactful. But it does still feel immersive, to the point that I had to remind myself to not try to lean on the table while playing.

I won't make use of it often, as it's easier to see details and the entire playfield at once on monitor, and ""fly cam"" lets you alter perspective in a VR type fashion to inspect ramps and angles. But I do think it's worth the (bundle discounted) price, for when I am in the mood for a more immersive experience. I bougth the platinum pack and have been playing about 30 hours now. Very very good piece of software. Did not try out multiplayer.

Ball Physics: 10/10
Sounds: 3/10
Joy: 10/10 I've changed my previous recommendation after successfully playing this on VR for several months.  I don't know what changed... but it does work now.

[b]Previous Recommendation from April 2022:[/b]
Don't buy the VR game add-on. It's broken, and throws an error with Valve Index. VR Pinball is the next best thing to owning actual tables, flat monitor just doesnt cut it once you have tried VR. This is how you do a VR addition to a game. Every single table that you already have in your collection is available in VR as well. And they look amazing in VR. The other big Pinball franchise on Steam aren't as generous with their (abandoned?) VR effort... Show your support to this great developer and get the VR version as well :) 

I get some stuttering from time to time, but I blame that on my ancient CPU (i5-4670K), not on my GPU (Radeon RX 5700 XT). Using Valve Index and the controls are working fine.

 This works well on the Oculus Quest 2 via Steam VR and looks really great. One thing I hope the developers change is the room layout which is set up as if you are on a film set with a missing back wall with film lighting etc. This really breaks the immersion for me, it would be much better if it were a complete normal room and also that you could move around it as well. But otherwise great - highly recommend.

Edit: When trying the sitting down VR option it was not possible to get the view into a good position (too far away and not high enough) even when modifying with the options available. So if the view options could have a wider range that would be great. Yeah I'm a lazy, lazy man who likes to be sat down ;)",0.17604157887343733

I requested a refund. I hope the dev comes back after 12 months of no update and continues to polish the game. Launch game, go straight to safe-mode, and still doesn't start. Enjoyed playing 6 minutes of safe-mode menu and submitted request for refund. I do not recommend the game in current state, but may revisit when the game is further developed. buggy fucking mess looking forward to the update This game is surprisingly good. It is intense and I love the atmosphere. Keep it up developer and don't give up on this game. I would love to see a fleshed out multiplayer system. First of all, this is an excellent game. Secondly, would I recommend it to everyone? No. So what's the reason for this on the first look contradicting statement?

The game does one thing: it puts you in a setting really similar to the Alien franchise, its spin-offs, and the fan fiction. You explore a facility and adjacent chasms which have fallen victim to a horrible catastrophe and are now crawling with aliens of all kinds. Most people are dead.

If you are a fan of the Alien franchise, you will see a lot of similarities and references to used equipment and monsters, which is really cool since there aren't a whole lot of games that will let you utilize and experience those in the way this game does.

So if you are really into all of that, get the game and have fun; you will probably love it. Since not so long ago, you are also able to bring a friend into the game with you, but only for some selected missions. Also this feature is still in very early alpha/beta, so be ready to deal with a bunch of issues. The developers have been really upfront with that, which is quite rare nowadays. GAME-BREAKING BUGS MAY APPEAR IN THE BETA VERSIONS; THAT'S WHY IT'S A BETA! (Close/open the game, uninstall/reinstall it, restart Steam, restart your system, switch game versions, and reinstall again. Something will work sooner or later.)

Now that the pros are out of the way, let's get to the cons. Who should NOT buy the game:

Anyone that expects a completely finished and neatly polished game. Again, it's a beta and some features are still in alpha.

Anyone that needs a fleshed-out and well-written storyline. The story is existent but mostly only tells you where to go next. It's not a novel.

Anyone who needs a lot of different things to do in a game. You will do the same stuff all the time. Climb in caves, use machinery, blast aliens, search objectives. That's it. Either you love it or hate it.

Really short conclusion:

Pros:

- small size (about 2 GB)

- low system requirements

- Alien fans will love the setting

- the mechanics all feel amazing (shooting, movement, climbing,  actions)

- you can change the settings to give yourself a real challenge.

Cons:

- repetitive (might feel like a chore at some points; again, either you love it or hate it)

- little guidance through the individual levels. A lot of trial and error.

One day, he wakes up in the space and unexpectedly comes across aliens. But the truth is, whom aliens actually met is his soul.","Enjoyed and recommend. Bought on sale for $2.79, great price. I think the $7 full price tag is reasonable if you're not strapped for cash, just understand it's a short film (~12 minutes).

The developers/storytellers clearly have experience telling stories in VR. This story is short and sweet, but what really brings it to life is the creative visual storytelling utilizing the VR medium. It's very well done, with beautiful and interesting and fun visual moments that are synthesized with the story.

The english voice acting is a little dull, but not bad, and it does its job.
I actually liked this enough that I watched it twice in a row (back to back), first in English then in Korean (which I do not understand) to hear it in its original language. I expected to just watch the first minute to get a sense of how it sounds in Korean, but ended up watching the whole thing over. I'm sure I'm not the best judge since I don't speak/understand Korean, but it seemed to me the Korean voice acting was more organic and emotive, so for my fellow non-Korean-speakers, I do recommend watching it again in Korean after you've watched it in English! I also suspect the last lines work better in Korean than in the English translation, which comes off a bit sideways.

Lovely experience. Nice short story, beautiful visuals. [h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift[/h1]

This is a 13 minute long, purely cinematic experience. You only need motion controllers at the start, to change language from Korean to English and press start or quit (although it quits automatically at the end so it's strange that it's there). It's running on the Unreal Engine and it is voiced in English.

This is a weird sci-fi story. The visuals are absolutely amazing. It's a mix of cartoon-type models, mixed with almost realistic backdrops & 3D models and environments. Visually, this is triple A quality stuff. Seeing the cartoony-looking characters mixed with the realistic looking environments is odd though. The scales are off in some of the scenes though (characters are way too big or 3D models are way too small relative to the surroundings). 

The story was just okay for me. It's not the quality of Google story-telling. I just found it plain weird and the ending was like WTF to me. The voice acting was nice, nothing special. I think the story was too short and it just didn't allow for the needed depth to this sci-fi mystical tale. Due to a scene involving death, I'm not sure this is appropriate for little kids.

Overall, I do think this is overpriced for what it is. Almost $7 USD for almost 13 minutes of entertainment. Gloomy Eyes was $9 USD, but it's 30 minutes long. However, I got this on sale for $3.49 USD and that seems like a justifiable price (although still on the high side). Ideally, it would only be normal price of $2-3 max. This is a better value proposition (and higher production values too IMO) though than Follow The Rabbit, which is by the same dev!

[b]Rate 5.5/10. Nice overall, just too expensive IMO. [/b] This animated short is about the same quality as Google's Spotlight Stories Shorts that we no longer get on Steam.  That is to say good quality animation and sound.  

The story is emotional and tugs at you, especially if you have children, but also if you think of your parents.  It is somewhat strange and has sci-fi elements.

I always said I would be willing to pay for the Spotlight shorts and here is the chance to pay for something similar and support this DEV.  It is worth the full price, IMO.

Make sure to switch the language to the one you want before starting, because it is default on Korean.

 Same **** as the first game, but with a light fantasy coat of paint on it (even though fantasy elements existed in the first game).

To keep the players active. It's cheap, you get what you pay for. 

You can sucker the AI in with a 10-20 pre-flop raise, then granted you've got over 150 chips, go all in and force everyone to fold.

Beyond a Joke is the most fun of the DLCs, I played it last and I was a bit disappointed until that point. With all of the content now released, it's not much easier for me to tell you whether or not it's worth it. In terms of value, you get seven cases; technically there are eight, but the final ""case"" of M for Mystery doesn't really count for reasons you'll see if you play it. With the exception of the first one, Saints and Sinners, they're all at least fairly good, though they're not particularly long (about the length of your typical side quest case, so an average of thirty minutes to an hour depending on your speed) and may only add up to a few hours of extra content total. It's also worth mentioning that you do get an extra scavenger hunt that's surprisingly fun, and can add some more to that final count, and there are some outfits thrown in here and there if you enjoy the dress-up mechanic.

For $25, I would say it's aiming a bit above its weight class, and personally I'd recommend waiting for a sale -- but if you're reading this before playing the game, I think it's a worthwhile suggestion to at least consider buying it early, after playing enough of the base game to know whether or not you actually like its mechanics to begin with. The base game itself suffers a lot from being open world, at least in my opinion, and for the most part it's very empty, with little incentive to wander around outside of where the cases take you. These DLCs might not add up to a lot, but most of them do activate fairly early on, and spreading any bit of extra content around its open world will probably make it a better experience as a whole, rather than playing them afterward. this ""Season Pass""  just 3 mini quest  cut out on full release game

2316580,Tales of Kenzera‚Ñ¢: ZAU,game,False,"23 Apr, 2024","Action, Adventure, Indie","Wield the dance of the shaman. Reclaim your father‚Äôs spirit. Brave the beautiful and treacherous land of Kenzera with the God of Death in Tales of Kenzera‚Ñ¢: ZAU, a metroidvania-style adventure crafted by Surgent Studios.","What a fantastic and emotional game.

Tales of Kenzera: ZAU does a lot to make itself stand out from a lot of similar games. First and foremost, the world is wholly unique, influenced by African (specifically Kenyan, if I am remembering correctly, apologies if not) culture, land and people. I can count on maybe one hand and a finger the number of games that fully embrace and wear these influences so loudly and proudly and as a result anyone going into this game should find the world refreshing and new, something vibrant and loud and intensely personal.

It is a beautiful game, letting colors splay proudly across it. As a smaller game, it will not have the most top of the line graphics but aesthetic and art direction have always and will always be more important than how realistic something looks. The environments are varied and colored wonderfully and the portrait art is absolutely gorgeous.

The story is going to be quite emotional; the creator has stated outright it was made in dealing with the death of his father and whoo boy, can you feel it. But even if you were to divorce the impetus and reasoning for it's creation from it, it tells a wonderful story with great characters and story beats. I have to give credit where due, the voice actors knocked it out of the park. So much of what works with the story is because the people voice acting the characters had so much range and emotion. While I cannot comment on the original Swahili language I have little doubt it is just as excellently acted due to phenomenal voice direction.

Gamewise, while it has much in common with Metroidvanias, I honestly think it has more DNA with platformers. Sure there's leveling, abilities and slowly unlocking areas because of them but there is definitely a strong concentration on movement and making difficult twists and turns in areas. Even in combat, movement is extremely important and you have a ton of ways to do so. I'd say that movement is incredibly satisfying, as you learn abilities and open up more ways to leap and run. Controls are responsive and for the most part I can't think of any issues around floatiness or missed inputs.

It's a shorter experience but I'd rather a game didn't overstay it's welcome if it did all it needed to do in the time it had. Heartily recommend this game, well worth the experience. I'll give the game a recommends because this was not a horrible experience. This is probably a wait for sale kind of experience though. It is a metroidvania-light. Kind of baby's first metroidvania. The core elements that make a metroidvania are there but in their most rudimentary form. It is an extremely short experience with more of a focus on its narrative. It's overall not fundamentally bad but there are some frustrating design choices that really drag down the experience. 

I am more of a gameplay andy and dont really care much about narratives. This was one serviceable to deliver the game, but by itself doesnt really bring anything that would make that a real draw to the game in my opinion. The protagonist is not really all that likable. The story elements are not overly intrusive though either so I didnt find myself wanting it to just go away and it has an overall good message in the end. 

The game play is decent with just some frustrating flaws. The combat in this game could have been really good. It suffers from some really cheap and borderline unfair enemy AI though. It also has a dodge with no animation cancel, something that just should be a sin in all game design IMO. This is made worse by actions with long wind up animations and/or recovery time between actions, all of which are fully interruptable by enemies. All of this leaves it feeling a little clunky and frustrating. They clearly want you not spamming buttons and making sure you truly want to press that button for every button press you do. The overall design of combat and enemies encounters all seem like they would be better served by a more fluid combat style though. 

Overall it is not terrible and could make for a decent quick palette cleanse between games. There is nothing overly special here though and it suffers from some design/execution flaws in the combat that drag it down. I've played a lot worse though and ultimately did enjoy my time with the game barring some periods of frustration with some of the cheap enemy AI and the ""slower than they should be"" attack animations. its really bad game the upgrades and fights is bad too bug with camera also from the start to the end its waste of money Zau truly touched me! I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game, having played other metroidvanias, Zau will always have a special place in my heart. A game truly slept on! I wish I could give this game more of an unqualified recommendation, because all of the art surrounding the game is impeccable. The story is well-told, the visuals and soundtrack are beautiful, and all the vocal performances are fantastic.

My big issue is with how this game plays. The combat feels good at first, but as more and more encounters pile on towards the latter half of the game and I start having to navigate enemies, traversal, and instant death traps all at once, the controls start to feel floaty, imprecise, and not altogether up to the task of sustaining even a game this short. Upgrades to each ability path feel insubstantial, the various traversal skills unlocked in each area feel too specialized to be exciting, and the last third of the game in particular is filled with combat rooms that lock until you fight two, three, four waves of enemies. These were perhaps my biggest annoyance by the end, as these kinds of combat rooms should be illegal on their own, but get all the more egregious when you're in a tiny arena and just manage to beat a wave of enemies, and then have a whole second and third wave spawn in when you think you're done. The repetition can get discouraging.

That said, I'm going to recommend this game regardless because the art and world are fascinating and unique, and I do hope this developer gets another shot at a game in this universe, where hopefully they learn to be much more intentional about the combat they decide to include, or even just get rid of it altogether. No game this short should have this many trash mobs, but even beyond that, a world this interesting could be so much better explored through means other than combat. Put more of a focus on traversal, solving problems, meeting interesting characters, and let your game and universe grow into its full potential rather than flounder against the creative limits of exploration through violence. Simple and short Metroidvania with good movement, graphics, story and music.
Movement provides a good sense of speed and flow.
Combat needs more variety and mask balance needs tuning. Blue mask is much more useful than red.
Played mostly on Steam Deck at 45 FPS with Steam Deck preset and XeSS Balanced. I came back to this game some time after they introduced Story mode, which is supposed to be more relaxed than Relaxed mode. But there is still a LOT of difficult, fast-paced fighting in it, which is very disappointing. Why do game developers put so much focus on violence and combat? Why can't we just explore, find things, talk with people and uncover the story without being forced to stop every few seconds to battle it out with fast moving enemies? I want to experience the Metroidvania side of the game but you're making me play Street Fighter. No thanks! Tales of Kenzera: Zau delivers an emotional narrative, elevated by captivating voice acting. The combat system is diverse and offers a compelling level of challenge that consistently keeps the gameplay engaging and enjoyable. Furthermore, the level design is vibrant (check out the backgrounds as you're walking back in most areas), featuring a rich variety of beautifully realized environments that are both visually stunning and narratively resonant. I have a few issues with this game, but most of them are minor. Even though it is a Metroidvania, there really isn't much backtracking too it, which I believe to be a very important part of the genre. When you reach a new area, you can finish that area before going to the next. There is no system for marking something on the map to check out again later. Also the performance is kinda bad for how the game looks, on Steam Deck I had plenty of FPS drops and eventually settled in on a 40fps cap just to keep it from dropping in random spots.

With all that said, the meat and potatoes of this game is not the actually moment to moment gameplay or deep exploration and discovery. Instead, this game is more about the characters and dealing with loss. I knew this going into it, and I was not disappointed. Having lost my father not long ago, I knew this game would hit me in the feels. And it did. But it was a wonderful experience and I definitely recommend the game.

People with disabilities cannot configure this game to a playable one. So sad; I really wanted to play the game as it looked really interesting.
Uninstalled after eight minutes of gameplay and set the ""hidden"" flag. I really, really want to like this game. The 2d portion shows a lot of potential, and the shift from perspective inside the game proper is well done and keeps you interested in whats going on. 

The game suffers from overly confusing sections during the 3d portion, I in particular had to speak with the dev twice due to getting stuck behind a plant and the game needing to have its collision changed, and another when a scripted event did not properly trigger to kill my character. 

Please dev, if you are reading this if you could post a text or video walkthrough or hint guide or some such it would make it much easier, and less likely for someone to get frustrated and quit because they couldnt figure out what to do.

(also please give a toggle to the bloom in the game, it tends to be overly blinding, and I need to mute the volume since the character walking is so loud.) After a couple of hours of trying and failing to make progress, I think the execution fails to live up to the idea. The 2D section felt quite like aimless wandering, and it was difficult to establish any sense of direction due to the similarity of every environment. The platforming mechanics were fairly rough on top of that.

I got bored before I even reached one of the 3D bits, and I think the disclaimer about the game's difficulty is a bit of a cop-out to make the poor mechanics seem deliberate. It just wasn't fun. I will recommend to play this game at the $15 dollar pricepoint solely because of the immersion. I wont put this on the game at all cause it may be my inability to work a keyboard in to play but it seems a bit rigid on the 2D aspect of things but aside from a few hiccups it does play pretty smooth as far as controls go. I was extremely hesistant and doubted the purchase going through the 2D portion as well but when you get into the 3D side of the game everything seems to click. The game gets that much more exciting (even after reviewing the trailer) and i cant hesitate when I say it gets that much more scary. It is a perma-death type game but i wouldnt let that stop you from checking it out.

Another great pack with a large variety of images and colors in each image, with each image being detailed enough to get a lot of enjoyment out of coloring them in.  These are the kinds of packs I was hoping we'd start getting, and I'm glad we are getting them now!  Definite recommend! This pack is honestly crazy good.

It's all very varied, both in colors, shapes, sizes, all that stuff. The images all look really nice too, the art quality is astounding on this one. A lot of pictures also just have fantastic composition, even if they're smaller, which I think is really cool. I literally had fun with every image in this pack except for that one pattern. Point is, this pack is worth your money, easily.

Objective - 5/5;
Subjective - 5/5; Whatever forbidden juice was sipped to make these new packs, I want it. Hope to see more good packs in the future. Another great DLC with some really good pieces of art :)",0.33007756132756133

The forbidden resurrection is nearly at hand. What could possibly go wrong?","I've played this game before but never finished it.  It was tough but not impossible and I enjoyed it a lot.  I'm looking forward to the third installment of the game. üëç Just a  few days ago I finished the 1st part and now the 2nd.
This is one of those games where you would like to see more....but at the same time it is good that this story is finished.
The best part is that you don't need excessive grinding. apart from an atrocious UI a pleasant little game to wile away a few hours its a great old school rpg the kind i grew up with as a kid and i love the turn based combat Finished it, really liked it. Adapting gear, figuring out which spells work best, side quests, easter eggs... yup, I had a blast. Trust me, I got more than 0.2. Its a nice little party based JRPG. Add to your collection! A must get! 9/10 great story - interesting development  of story - loved the characters- some battles need a lot of strategy to be able to defeat main bosses- a guide would be helpful as would an overall map Not as good as number 1. Still entertaining though. It gets better after the first mountain level. This is a great game for all fans of good RPG-Maker games out there. Like Dragons' Twilight I it includes all you need: quirky characters, an interesting storyline, cute graphics, funny dialogues and fitting music. I especially liked the monster-designs, the crafting system and the myriad of weapons you can get by solving numerous quests. Most bosses are not too easy but not nervewreckingly hard. A little grinding is recommended, but it is minimal compared to other games out there (I hate mindless hour-long grinding, so this was a relief). The last boss is challenging but beatable. Just solve the quests and craft your own stuff mostly and you are good (don't forget to get those crystal keys) :) I enjoyed every minute of Dragons' Twilight I + II and am looking forward to playing 7th Deep. Kudos to the developer of those little gems. Sadly the good RPG-Maker games often drown in the mass of mediocre to outright bad games out there. I had to do quite a bit of digging to find Dragons' Twilight here on Steam. Long story short, I highly recommend playing Dragons' Twilight I+II if you want to have a good time.

3412560,Retro Endurance 8bit,game,False,"22 Jan, 2025","Action, Adventure, Casual, Indie, Racing, RPG, Strategy, Early Access","Retro Endurance 8bit is a unique retro game collection of 35 games where no two games play alike. It delivers fun reimagining of NES classics with a shuffler/randomizer story mode, an arcade mode, special gameplay events, challenge modes, and more!","Requested a refund. I'm older and I love retro games, but this is like if Action 52 was worse and switched games every few seconds. I'm not downvoting it because someone may like it, but it is not at all what I want to play. Just give me the full games to play, if they even exist... So addictive! Could not stop playing, played 4 hours straight and then the evil spider boss showed me not to be so cocky! Would heartily recommend this mini game extravaganza, the dev is very active too, plenty of meaty updates A lot of fun for the current asking price. If you like WarioWare or NES Ultimate Remix, you'll enjoy this. Cool little time-waster with a ton of variety I love this game. it's like wario ware with retro-like games. plenty here for a early release and very impressive it's made one dev. it's a shame though that when you play the games without the ""rush"" you get a timed amount in which you could play them. would be cool if they were short games but had little endings. Similar to UFO 50, but this is much more fun than that title (IMO of course). It's a Early access game so it's limited and more content is sure to follow. The early Famicom music is spot on (Even that high pitchness of games like legend of kage). Game looks the part, my only complaints would be the control is either too stiff or slippery and the fact that the stand alone versions are timed because there are some bangers on there I wish were full experiences, but that's asking WAY too much for one person. To put it simply If you love 8 bit retro games and wario ware rush then you would be wrong to not get this. Even at it's current state, it's a lot of fun. I love NES classics and micro-mini game challenges, this is the best of both worlds. 

Almost all of the games are worth your time. At the time of writing there's 27 microgames currently available. Challenges inspired by Punch Out, Gradius, Zelda, Mario, Mr. Driller, Bomberman, Dragon Quest, and many many more keep everything feeling fresh after hundreds of runs. Eventually you can disable a few games, allowing you to tailor the experience a little. 

What's here is great. I can't wait to see what improvements the solo dev comes up with over time. Just so much fun! I don't think there is a dud in here! This is a very fun idea that plays better than the mini games have any right to. 
Wonderful on the steam deck as well. Very fun little set of games that also gets pretty challenging in the later stages. Cool idea seemingly inspired by NES shufflers. So far the ideas are well-made, if a bit floaty.

Use your weapons effectively, deflect enemy bullets with your shield, and recapture the Moon from alien infestation!","Really fun shmup with some fire tunes. Leveling up for the extra options is my only peeve, but it doesn't really matter at the end of the day. One of my favorite games of all time <3 I don't know what it is about this shump. It's not ground breaking or really all that challenging. But I can never be in a bad mood playing it. In my opinion this is one of the finest shooters ever made. The balance and progression is so well executed, and the music is incredible. tbh i only bought this because the music is kickass as all hell but i forgot how much fun schmups are and i want to get into that genre some more Eschatos is a miracle ""video games aren't art"" mfers when they reach area 12: good soundtrack. i don't know what i'm doing! Shmups are an oddity of a genre. A niche genre known for having Dark Souls levels of difficulty and being all about repeatedly failing again and again until you've learned how to dance to the genre's at times maddening tunes. It's one of the oldest genres in gaming, having its roots in the arcades of the 70s. That arcade heritage where the genre got its obsession with extreme difficulty. 

A genre as fixated on being extremely difficult as shmups to the point that some of the games are described as ""dodging a rain of death"" or a ""bullet hell"" can be a little difficult to get into. So where does one start if they wanna give the genre a go? Well, Eschatos is a pretty good place. 

Eschatos is not a very lengthy game. A whole run through the game will take you less than 30 minutes. But there's the beauty in the genre. Even on the easiest difficulty Eschatos will give you a challenge, it even inches into bullet hell territory at times. But you'll get the hang of the dance. And when you do, there's higher difficulties waiting. There's alternate modes waiting. There's online leaderboards to compete with the world. You can dance to Eschatos' tunes again and again and eventually master it. 

It's also quite pretty. Visually, Eschatos looks like it escaped from the Dreamcast. A system that's known for quite clean visuals. There's a great soundtrack and a just cool arranged version of said soundtrack. 

In short, TLDR, ETC: A great gateway drug to the shmup genre. tl;dr: this game is the real deal, buy it. interested in shmups at all? buy it. recurring veteran in search of lesser-known games? buy it.


ESCHATOS is kinda an odd bird. First of all, it's a game made by a [i]healthcare company[/i] out of all things, and second of all, it's a port of an X360 game, well out of the shoot-em-up genre prime. So what gives? Is this shovelware? Certainly looks like it, right?

Surprisingly, no, because ESCHATOS was clearly made by people who really, REALLY know what makes shoot-em-ups tick. First, for a shmup to tick, it must have a great soundtrack - no exceptions - and Yousuke Yasui (the composer) cooked up an iconic soundtrack. Super catchy to the point where people who normally don't play shmups know about it.

Well what about gameplay - judging by the screenshots, it's some sort of bullet hell? No, actually! A lot of shmups at the time patterned themselves off bullet hells, but ESCHATOS is really not one - it gives you a shield that you can smash through any pattern that's too dense anyways. More than anything, ESCHATOS feels like it has the heart of a classic 80's Toaplan game (e.g. Truxton/Tatsujin) down to the high player speed, space-based excuse plot, stupidly catchy soundtrack, and memo-heavy gameplay.

As that would suggest, speedkilling enemies and midbosses by memorizing where they come from is the name of the game. Switching between your front and wide shot is a big part of the gameplay (enemies tend to come at you at weird angles, not just the top of the screen, so it's a pressing question at all times), but the real interesting part is the aforementioned shield. It pulls double duty as a super-damaging melee weapon and a tool to break through bullet patterns you can't dodge in between. Scoring well is a matter of not letting enemies go off-screen, which means (you guessed it) playing the game over and over again.

However, ESCHATOS is a game that I am more than happy to play over and over again. No checkpoints, no powering down after you die, no speed-ups (you can control your speed at will), and most of all, it's just plain fun. It's very easy to get into this perfect flow state dodging enemies and bullets: the mark of a great game.

The one thing that the game really lacks on is its 3D graphics. Allegedly, this game started as a DirectX graphics pet project before being turned into a commercial release, and uhhhhhh it shows. Very strange art direction with a lack of cohesion (I like weird art direction, but I want a little explanation as to why 1950's tin saucers are accompanied by biblically accurate angel midbosses), and at worst, when the game decides it wants a cinematic angle for its stage, it gets very hard to judge depth for some projectiles and even bosses that ostensibly appear to be background objects (That boss has CONTACT DAMAGE at THAT DEPTH????). I will admit that despite all of this, it [i]mostly[/i] works, and there's an impressive amount of scale and movement between areas for a budget studio's first 3D game.

The game's biggest selling point may be that it's a great game for beginners: if you're curious about the genre, [b]start here.[/b] The difficulty selection is well curated (an easy easy mode, how about that? plus a normal mode that isn't a slouch), and for people who really, really want to sink their time into this game, there's a nightmare-equivalent harder-than-hard mode that looks plain impossible, as well as two extra arrange-ish modes that offer cool takes on the basic game. The game does a good job at gently nudging you to get a 1CC (doing the whole thing on one ""coin"") which I like a lot: no disservice is done to the genre more than giving off the impression that these games have historically been impossible coin-eaters that only the deepest of wallets can see the end of. You can learn these, trust me!

All things considered, ESCHATOS is really the little game that could: a weird little 7th gen XBLA release that IMO belongs in the pantheon of all-time great shmups. Even at full price I'd say this is a must-buy. Go play ESCHATOS. Trust me when I say that this game is HARD. Even on the lowest difficulty setting, this game still gets pretty intense later on. Despite that, it's still quite fun and rewarding. ESCHATOS is by the same developer behind Judgement Silversword: Resurrection and as a result, it has similar gameplay mechanics. I do however feel that this game is a considerably better experience overall. The soundtrack is also amazing here. Overall, this is an easy recommendation for shmup fans.",0.06665181945794185
1900160,Prodigy Trainer,game,False,"2 Apr, 2022",Simulation,"A young warrior seeks to learn the ways of darkness. In order to do so, she must gain your trust and respect.","60/100 This game does not work. Crashes every time you attempt to interact with anything in it. Scam. Sadly this game sucks, must be one of their first games. DO NOT waste you money, this is an abandoned game without patches or anything useful from the dev's other than cashing their checks. May the force be with you .. I am giving a poitive review while the game is at about 1.5$ or 1.5‚Ç¨, but it is in my opinion not worth more.
Buy it only if you are a Star Wars fan and want some fun out of the SW universe.

+ There are good traits of humor from the MC who is supposed to be a ""dark side"" lord,
* there is a pseudo storyline which you must grind through to progress, and NO IT IS NOT BUGGED ; you just have to do other activities, including training of your student/padawan, to let her progress in her (two) skills before your griding has further effect.
+ the face of the padawan/student is nicely done (at least for my taste) during the BJ and S‚Ç¨x animations, where she rolls her eyes, lean her head and do other sensual things making the animations more lively and attractive

- story IS short..
- most of the progress/events are just stills, images,
- you don't get any steam achievement, or galery, or other things you usually get with a renpy. I believe that game was made with Unity because of the way it looks, by a young unskilled but fairly creative and kinky developper..
- some of the protagonists you meet would deserve a bit of ""action"", but the dev didn't provide the option.
- when the story is full done, you don't even have a message that there is nothing else to do ; you knocked your padawan and she is pregnant and has max skills, then I did not find anything else after to do except to repeat griding for cash.
- if you are stuck with the password to find during a quest, either look in the forum discussions, or try any of the suggested words going back and forth (I won't write it here, no no, do your research.. it's not so hard),
- if you threaten the nighclub manager as Rake asks you to in the game, it will give one option to get BJ for free at night by Rake's slave but it locks away the option to have your student work as an exotic dancer in the nightclub.. you get no clue that this will have an impact on your options, neither do you later get an option to have your padawan work there anyway, even if you can buy the nightclub outfit.

In short, only buy when on sale as right now at 1.50$ its meh The references of a certain War of the Star is as subtle as an arrow to the knee... at Mach 9...

Basically a waifu raising game where you raise your ""Dark not-Sith waifu"" where you can either be indifferent, caring or just be a plain human garbage to her to prepare her to face the self righteous not-Jedi Master she used to train under.

Some of the seggs scenes are animated and there was no clear hints on how you should clear each mission. 

The VN game kinda bugged out on me since I find myself stuck after clearing the Final Mission. Without any hints on how to proceed from that point, Players might find themselves stuck in a loop of; send her to various jobs at day and do ""things"" with her at night, rinse and repeat the next day. This BORING loop is DEADLY for the pacing of this kind of adult themed VN game where this loop gets OLD, VERY FAST.

Well, I guess it's an okay adult VN game. Nothing bad nor noteworthy to make it stand out. Not all of the scenes are even viewable. The floor scrubbing never progresses past 2/4. I think this is a good premise with flawed execution. My mediclorians didn't really tingle with this one.
This is another great premise with lackluster execution.
Sadly not the chosen one that brings unbalance to my force.
If you think my writing is bad, you are in for a treat, this game's writing is worse. 
Also the game was buggy for me and the scenes didn't really feel stimulating on top.

My main char Darth Douche was more of pansy than the most powerful dark lord in the universe.
I miss choices, even meaningless ones that add flavour.

The attempts of humour are so shallow they almost work for a pornographic visual novel but I feel like the game is missing cheesy aggressive dirty talk and more action.
Example: Darth Douche has to convince a museum's librarian he is smart by solving her questionnaire instead of using his nigh unlimited dark powers to make her clothes disappear.

That and many more missed opportunities await you, should you play this game.
May the force be with you, it certainly wasn't with this game.",2.339411430321149e-05
2342210,GENIE,game,False,"7 Apr, 2023",Indie,"Explore fantastic environments as Lula, as she journeys to discover the meaning of the Genie and fulfill her destiny.","After completing Genie, I can say I have played every game Tonguc Bodur has put out. Every. Last One. I'm pretty sure I haven't given a single other one of his games a negative review, but I cannot recommend this one. The music, environments, and voice acting are all great. But the gameplay loop...gets repetitive and uninteresting after a couple of chapters, and there are 15 chapters. The fact that this loop involves looking into a blinding white light, a light that made me physically look away every time, was utterly terrible. I muted the game audio and watched a movie while trying to earn the achievements (I had to stop because somehow one of the chapter's game audio was playing despite the master volume and all other volumes being muted). I might have actually read more of the poems if the pacing was not so slow, and if the whole poem appeared at once like most of Tonguc's games. The story was just not engaging enough to warrant the tediousness and slow pacing. I got this on sale for $0.99 and I still feel like it wasn't worth it. The story was drug out far longer than it needed to be, and not in a meaningful or engaging way like most of Tonguc's games. Get it on sale if you decide to get it at all. Honestly, just check out some of Tonguc's other games, as many of them are actually really great. Just not this one. Bought this game as soon as it came out.  Hit a snag in chapter 2 that caused me to drop it for a while.  Picked it up again the other day, finished all the way until the end.  Game was tedious at times and too wordy, but I remembered the excerpts from the classic 'Drizzlepath: Genie'.  Was also entranced by some of the visuals this time -- places worth exploring.  Wish Chapter 9   was a whole game by itself, a few others.  Look forward to other titles by this same author, games do surprise me. It was this one winter day I opened Steam
Scrolled down my wishlist out of theme
Stopped my movement for once or two
Just to sneeze my nose due the flue
The list must have had games I no longer needed
Despite of this I further proceeded
It must have been more than a hundred games I passed
Appeared the thing which I waited at last
Tags of Walking Simulator and Atmospheric it wore
Bodur's name as its maker and price discounted

No longer I dared to wait
but slightly open my wallet for a coin or pair
Few moments I have spent to play it
Writing a poem as a review I see fit

Genie's gameplay value is medium as its best
But I'd be fool to decline it has put my mind to rest
So if you want to take a break and a moment of stop
Then Genie won't be a jiff destined to flop

However to make sure not praise the game too much and call it genius
For many can write a poem or a book of them and that should be obvious A must have for any Tonguc Bodur fan. This is one of the better ones! First, I'm a fan of this dev's games and have played and enjoyed many of them. 

Genie, as with all of Bodur's games, is filled with beautiful environments to explore. And as described on the game's store page, Genie is 15 chapters of traveling through different environments, collecting shards and then locating platforms where you stand and listen to the story in poetry form.

Rinse, repeat ‚Ä¶ 15 times.

The dev does give you the option to fast forward through the narration and by about midway I was thankful for that option. 

If you haven‚Äôt tried any of Bodur‚Äôs games, I would recommend most of them if you‚Äôre a fan of the walking sim genre and if you enjoy taking screenshots; Bodur‚Äôs games are filled with lots of excellent opportunities to capture some nice shots.

However, there are better options from this dev than Genie. The gameplay loop in this is simply awful. It consists of wandering around the small and often cluttered environments searching for crystals. Then when you have collected all the crystals you get to wander the environments again looking for these glowing discs on the floor. When you step on the disc you go into this black and white night vision mode where you get to search around again, but this time for a light. Stare into it. Go blind. Then get a narrated bit of prose for the narrative, which often seems nonsensical, as if it was put together for the sake of rhyming, but has no real meaning. It's bland, boring and repetitive. It's not fun on level 1. I wanted to stop before before I had finished the graveyard that is level 2. This atrocity repeats 14 times, as there are 15 levels!

The environments are pretty, but feel lifeless and empty. They don't feel like they naturally connect in any way either. I didn't feel like I was on a journey at all. I felt like I was being shoehorned from one tiny cluttered box to another tiny cluttered box over and over again. All the while the story is being told me. Show it don't tell it! This is a video game! The worst offender is the final level when you are at the genie. The discs that give the narrated text just keep appearing over and over. It's insanely drawn out. Shit or get off the pot! Say what you're going to say and then leave. Don't overstay your welcome, which this does. The music is all over the place too. None of it felt appropriate or added to the atmosphere. Playing through this was a chore. At 2.4 hours I beat the game and got all the achievements. There is no reason to replay this, not that you'd want to anyway. It's not worth a first play through. AVOID!!! I loved everything about this one except the mind numbing repetitive slog to hear each piece of poetry. I began to hate this game by chapter 5, I qave up in disgust by chapter 7. Find gems. Trigger checkpoint. Stand on checkpoint. Go blind. Read story. Repeat til chapter's end. Repeat until finished.

It's an ok walking simulator, but I'd have rathered find things on a path to unravel the tale than how it progresses here. The progression here actually got really boring for me by chapter two as well. Can't say a great walking sim if you want something with substance. If you want something to relax with before going to sleep or something nice to do with your child to help them nod off, Genie does make for a good interactive bedtime story

That said I can't really suggest Genie with so many other walking sims that exist and manage to pull you into the story far better than this does. I'm not sure why Drizzlepath: Genie needed a remake, but here we are. You ""play"" as Lula, who is some lady I guess. You wish you could run around the map as you look for some random crystals. When you find enough, you stand on some little magic stone thing that reads you ""poetry."" I guess the crystals are of the amphetamine variety because I don't know how else you could come up with those verses. There's scarcely ever an attempt at meter, the diction is embarrassing, and the rhyming is dismal: some of my favorites are ""melodic/romantic,"" ""true/true,"" and ""kids/eccentric."" The voice acting of all the poetry is a mixed bag. On one hand, she definitely read all the lines correctly. On the other hand, she sounded like she was narrating a cheap kid's show on Channel 4. I think that's the only channel they have over there, anyway, so I'm sure they play kid's shows.

The graphics and music are bog standard for a Tonguc Bodur walking simulator. If you like how those things are in any of his other games, you'll like them here, and vice versa. For the uninitiated, you are in for some really detailed environments full of licensed assets that don't make a whole lot of sense together. Here this game really shines through: about half the maps just look nothing like the rest of the game and make no sense in the context of what story there is. It appears that some of the maps were designed around certain asset packs, and not in a fun surreal way either. Oh, and you get a LOT of gigantic statues in the background because why not. The music generally sounds kind of bored, but at least the kind of music playing is switched up enough to not be completely mind numbing.

The story is what really gets me, though. I won't spoil the ending, though suffice it to say that those familiar with Drizzlepath: Genie aren't in for any shockers. Anyway, you play as Lula, who lives in a village run by shamans. They need to get to a genie before a wizard does in order to gain free will. The rest of the story progression is subtle, overwrought variations on banal family themes and Enlightenment ideas. Basically, the traditions and belief systems of the past are lame, and instead you should believe in nothing and start running civilization on the fuel of ""just be good because."" Life is important because it's an interesting coincidence and that's it. If any of the themes mentioned are interest to you, I suggest The Talos Principle or The Fall Parts 1 and 2, by the way.

Ironically, this game just completely convinced me of the physical reality of both purgatory and hell.

I can't decide whether I'm more grateful that there weren't any collectibles to get or disappointed at how the one shred of gameplay in most of these was stripped out.

TLDR: you only use WASD to move, one button to skip poetry slam cutscenes, and one button to interact. I got all the achievements and only used the interact button twice. It's fine I guess, a bit too repetetive though.",0.06228155525030522

Please Capcom, stop allowing devs to get help from their chidren to choose colour-schemes for the skins in this game.

I really like the concept and the look of the game, but there are a few things that would make the game better to a point i would recommend it.

-there needs to be more content, right now there are not enough tracks and playmodes

-the customization is good though i find it sad that you cant change the color of the parts, would make it more individuell

-the screen moves to much while you drive, you may get dizzy from it

Things that i like are:

-the concept (it is barely touched upon and is in need of a good game)
-the combat system (items/weapons), im not sure though if its balanced enough.

-the looks of the cars and the world

Keep it up and i believe this could be a good game once it is released.

DANGER. AVOID.
[/h1] ‚†Ä
Countershading, or [b]Thayer's law[/b], is a method of camouflage in which an animal's coloration is darker on the upper side and lighter on the underside of the body. This pattern is found in many species of mammals, reptiles, birds, fish, and insects, both in predators and in prey. When light falls from above on a uniformly coloured three-dimensional object such as a sphere, it makes the upper side appear lighter and the underside darker, grading from one to the other. 

This pattern of light and shade makes the object appear solid, and therefore easier to detect. The classical form of countershading, discovered in 1909 by the artist Abbott Handerson Thayer, works by counterbalancing the effects of self-shadowing, again typically with grading from dark to light. In theory this could be useful for military camouflage, but in practice it has rarely been applied, despite the best efforts of Thayer and, later, in the Second World War, of the zoologist Hugh Cott. 

The precise function of various patterns of animal coloration that have been called countershading has been debated by zoologists such as Hannah Rowland (2009), with the suggestion that there may be multiple functions including flattening and background matching when viewed from the side; background matching when viewed from above or below, implying separate colour schemes for the top and bottom surfaces; outline obliteration from above; and a variety of other largely untested non-camouflage theories. 

A related mechanism, counter-illumination, adds the creation of light by bioluminescence or lamps to match the actual brightness of a background. Counter-illumination camouflage is common in marine organisms such as squid. It has been studied up to the prototype stage for military use in ships and aircraft, but it too has rarely or never been used in warfare. The reverse of countershading, with the belly pigmented darker than the back, enhances contrast and so makes animals more conspicuous. It is found in animals that can defend themselves, such as skunks. 

The pattern is used both in startle or deimatic displays and as a signal to warn off experienced predators. However, animals that habitually live upside-down but lack strong defences, such as the Nile catfish and the Luna moth caterpillar, have upside-down countershading for camouflage. 

The [b]Streisand effect[/b] is an unintended consequence of attempts to hide, remove, or censor information, where the effort instead increases public awareness of the information. The effect is named for American singer and actress Barbra Streisand, whose attorney attempted in 2003 to suppress the publication of a photograph showing her clifftop residence in Malibu, taken to document coastal erosion in California, inadvertently drawing far greater attention to the previously obscure photograph. The effect exemplifies psychological reactance, in which the attempt to hide information instead makes it more interesting to seek out and propagate.

Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning
They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I got

Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch, I'm from
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans, nigga?
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans, nigga
Kendrick Conan, nigga
Where you sword at? Hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra, scream, ""Fuck your position"" and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats
Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the East side
Know that's just how Compton roll
And that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'ma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-Eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo' in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flying back to my city 'cause I'll forever standby
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of N.W.A
America target our rap market, as controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich and the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers that know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of ros√©
This was brought to you by Dre

-Zombies can kill you through doors
-Inconsistencies: 1) Cannot (always) shoot through doors
                             2) Sometimes it's 1 headshot, they die, other times 2-3+ shots are required to kill (same weapon)
                                  That makes it annoying, when it comes to judging movement and shots needed.
                             3) Sometimes hitboxes are a miss, zombies seem to hit you even seemingly not being on you, also they seem to magically hit you between knifing delays, even if at a distance.

You can view my gameplay & review here: https://youtu.be/s9rtxvZjQKM

This isn't a bad VR music visualizer. There's just better ones (even some free ones). I would have recommended this game / app, but one of the major listed features on the store page no longer works. YouTube music integration doesn't work and hasn't worked for quite a while with no response from the dev. As such, I can't in good conscience recommend this game. 

You can still play your own music. I believe it does have to be .mp3 format though. I know that .wav format did not work at all. Adding your own music is very easy and can be done within the app. There are three different environments and four different visualizations. You can also vary the levels control, particles, color length, base & treble height & sensibility.

Even though I only paid .99 cents, I just can't recommend this app where there's a major feature that's advertised on the store page that just doesn't work, especially with no response from the dev. Also, there are better free music visualizers. This isn't a bad music visualizer though. If you're looking for one where you can fly around and where you can easily add your own .mp3, then this may be right for you.

[b]Rate 4.5/10. I would have given a positive recommendation and a 6/10 if YouTube integration worked. [/b]

Vision VR and Cosmic Flow: A Relaxing VR Experience are both free and much better IMO.[/i] I actually love this, I would make it so the user can move the menus, they get in the way when playing songs and you have to close it, inconvientant if you want to record it.  I would make instructions clearing on making the graphics do what you can do with them.  I'm trying to figure out the controls and it's not easy as far as moving the scene graphics around.  I can't figure out how to fly around, the review says you can but it doesn't move for me?  Also I can't seem to get it to play .wav or m4a formats?

[h1]Ryan George Style Pitch Meeting for Elementary My Dear Majesty! (feat. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson)[/h1]

Publisher: So, you have a hidden object adventure game for me?

Game Designer: Yes, sir, I do!

Publisher: Alright, hit me with it.

Game Designer: So, Elementary My Dear Majesty! is this wild hidden object adventure where you play as a detective named Felix. Your mission? Solve the mystery of a princess who was totally normal at a tea party‚Äîuntil she turned into a giant, man-eating monster.

Publisher: Oh my god.

Game Designer: Right? So naturally, the way to solve this is by clicking on a bunch of random objects that have no logical connection to the case whatsoever.

Publisher: Oh, well, that sounds frustrating.

Game Designer: Super easy, barely an inconvenience! Players will be totally fine once they accept that none of this makes sense! Like, at one point, you repair a hot air balloon with a single piece of tape.

Publisher: Wait, how does that even‚Äî

Game Designer: Hey, shut up!

Publisher: Oh, okay then!

Game Designer: The game is full of these moments! Like, oh, you need to power a spaceship? Easy, just find a watermelon in a tree. You need to get past an obstacle? No worries, just launch a sheep from a catapult.

Publisher: That‚Äôs not how anything works!

Game Designer: But see, that‚Äôs the fun! Nothing makes sense, so everything makes sense.

Publisher: That doesn‚Äôt make sense.

Game Designer: Exactly! The game is a mystery, so the real mystery is why anything in it happens at all!

Publisher: Wow wow wow. Wow.

Game Designer: And now here‚Äôs where things get really exciting‚ÄîSherlock Holmes shows up!

Publisher: What? Sherlock Holmes is in this?

Game Designer: Well, not in the game! No, no, no. He just shows up during this pitch meeting for no reason at all!

Publisher: What?!

Game Designer: Yeah! Just totally unannounced, doesn‚Äôt help with the game, doesn‚Äôt contribute in any way. He‚Äôs just here now, sitting there, looking mysterious, drinking tea, offering random observations.

[At this exact moment, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson dramatically step into the room, as if they‚Äôve been listening from the hallway.]

Sherlock Holmes: Elementary, my dear Watson.

Watson (nodding gravely): Indeed, Holmes. Most elementary.

Publisher: WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

Game Designer: Exactly! That‚Äôs the reaction we want! You‚Äôre confused, right? You don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs happening?

Publisher: Not even a little bit!

Game Designer: Perfect! That‚Äôs what makes it tight!

Sherlock Holmes (sipping tea): Ah, yes. A most peculiar situation indeed.

Watson: Though I dare say, Holmes, it is not nearly as peculiar as that time with the left-handed chimney sweep and the trained ferret.

Sherlock Holmes: Ah, Watson, I fear the ferret was merely a red herring.

Publisher: I‚ÄôM SORRY, ARE WE JUST IGNORING THE FACT THAT SHERLOCK HOLMES AND WATSON HAVE MATERIALIZED IN THIS PITCH MEETING?

Game Designer: Yup!

Publisher: Why?!

Game Designer: Mystery!

Publisher: But they‚Äôre not even in the game!

Game Designer: Exactly! That‚Äôs what makes it extra mysterious! The game isn‚Äôt about Sherlock Holmes, and yet he‚Äôs here! Which means there must be a reason!

Publisher: Is there a reason?!

Game Designer: Nope!

Publisher: WHAT?!

Sherlock Holmes: Ah, my dear sir, sometimes the absence of a reason is the most intriguing reason of all.

Watson: Well said, Holmes. Truly, a puzzle wrapped in an enigma, with a side of tea.

[Sherlock sips his tea thoughtfully. Watson nods, satisfied. The Publisher rubs his temples.]

Publisher: Okay, so... are they just gonna be here for the rest of the meeting?

Game Designer: Oh, absolutely. They‚Äôre just part of the vibe now.

Publisher: And they don‚Äôt... do anything?

Game Designer: Nope!

Sherlock Holmes: Quite right. Our presence is purely incidental, yet inexplicably essential.

Publisher: Oh my god.

Game Designer: I know, right? So anyway, back to the game! The whole thing is super silly. At one point, you defeat an enemy by distracting them with a dancing bear.

Publisher: Why?

Game Designer: Because!

Sherlock Holmes: A most elementary tactic. The bear is a diversion, the diversion is a strategy, and the strategy is victory.

Watson: Indeed, Holmes, most astute!

Publisher: WHY ARE THEY STILL HERE?!

Game Designer: Because it‚Äôs fun! People will be so baffled by Sherlock‚Äôs presence, they‚Äôll totally ignore how nonsensical the game is. Instead of asking, ‚ÄúWhy does fixing a balloon with tape work?‚Äù they‚Äôll be like, ‚ÄúWhy was Sherlock Holmes in the pitch meeting?‚Äù and boom, we‚Äôve created intrigue!

Publisher: That doesn‚Äôt make sense!

Game Designer: Exactly!

Sherlock Holmes: A brilliant deduction, my dear sir. Confusion is the key to curiosity, and curiosity is the key to engagement.

Publisher: You know what? Fine! I don‚Äôt even care anymore. Let‚Äôs just get this over with. What‚Äôs next?

Game Designer: Oh, just one more thing.

Publisher: Oh no.

Game Designer: I wrote a strategy speech inspired by Sherlock Holmes, wanna hear it?

Publisher: Do I have a choice?

Game Designer: No!

[Game Designer dramatically clears throat.]

Game Designer: This mustn't register on a logical level. First, introduce randomness. Then, distract with inconsequential details. Counter any logical objection with more nonsense. Discombobulate. The confusion will cause mental hesitation. They will attempt to rationalize. Block with misdirection. Weaken resolve. Now fracture expectations. Break any semblance of coherence. Traumatize sense of reality. Dislocate all reasoning entirely. Heel kick to cognitive stability. In summary, brain spinning, logic dismantled, three assumptions shattered, four paradigms broken. Concept of linear storytelling: hemorrhaging. Capacity to understand why Sherlock Holmes is here: neutralized.

Publisher: WHAT DID I JUST LISTEN TO?!

Game Designer: A flawless business strategy!

Sherlock Holmes: Elementary.

Watson: Indeed, Holmes.

Publisher: I need to lie down.

Game Designer: Great! So we‚Äôre all set for release!

Publisher: Okay then.

[Sherlock and Watson tip their hats, finishing their tea as they fade mysteriously into the ether.]

Publisher: Did they just vanish into thin air?!

Game Designer: I don‚Äôt know!

Publisher: I hate this job.

Game Designer: Great!

[h1] Dishonest Trailer for Elementary My Dear Majesty![/h1]

[EPIC TRAILER VOICE]

From the minds behind... well, something, comes a game that asks the bold question: What if a detective solved a mystery using absolutely zero detective skills?

Get ready for Elementary My Dear Majesty!, the hidden object adventure that takes logic, throws it out a castle window, and replaces it with sheep catapults, watermelon-fueled spaceships, and repairing a hot air balloon with tape!

Step into the stylish boots of Felix, a detective who doesn‚Äôt detect anything and instead helps a cursed princess by clicking on whatever shiny object the game tells you to. Think it makes sense? Think again! Your brain is now hostage to the whims of a game that treats physics, reality, and common sense like a suggestion at best.

‚ÄîNeed to fix a broken machine? Find a fish!
‚ÄîObstacle in your way? Just lob an animal at it!
‚ÄîLooking for a clue? Why not check under this pile of completely unrelated nonsense?!

With graphics that look like a fever dream from 2012 and animations so stiff you‚Äôll wonder if the characters are held together by sheer willpower, this game is pure chaotic nonsense from start to finish!

And just when you think you understand it, Sherlock Holmes randomly appears in the pitch meeting to remind you that nothing makes sense anymore!

So if you love mysteries but hate solving them, click your way through the most baffling adventure ever made!

Elementary, my dear‚Ä¶ something!

 [h2]Elementary My Dear Majesty![/h2]

Has a total of [b]6[/b] trading cards. :o!  This is pretty good for a rather cheap game.  ^-^

It doesn't make you motion sick whilst you try to rotate your camera/search for stuff and it has humor to it as well!  The hero's mustache is so skinny and long...  It looks all wrong...!  But that's how it's designed.

So if you played Cats in Time or Hidden Paws...  This is rather similar.  It DOES have a cat...  Pretty sure it's the same black one though.

Right well...  You go from floating scenery to floating scenery and do quests.  The people are rude and have crazy tasks for ya.  That's normal.

There are also parts where you can catapult stuff...  Those are fun...

Of course not everything is great.

- The cannon may get stuck and that's the ONLY trajectory you can fire it at.  Especially during the ""Pandas destroy the Great Wall"".
- Items are sometimes (very rarely) so small or so damn hidden you can't freaking find them without a hint.  Snow level.  *cough*
- Some mini-games are a beep to play.  Looking at you ""copy my dance moves"".  Ancient temple/the ""two robots/space"" levels.

I hadn't run into any other weird problems, so I call it good!

Overall it's a nice distraction and humor, despite being ridiculous...  Which is the point...  Is actually not bad at all!

Bur really...  Let's face it...  IF I were to dye my cat?  I would be the one dyed...  In a very delightful shade of dark crimson.

Woo...  Hoo...?!

Thank yous!!  :3 =) :> I am 32 years old.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you. This game is a really fun game. Its humorous and is fine for all ages as far as I can tell. Elementary My Dear Majesty! is a mobile app-like low poly family friendly point-and-click adventure game with numerous simple hidden object and physics puzzles and minigames.  There's a somewhat nonsensical fairy-tale themed story with a lot of iPhone screen tapping to step along through the simple storyline.  Collect enough fruit for this, collect enough cogs for that, play a crane minigame to put this over there, that kind of thing.  Shallow, not all that interesting for a PC game, but it might have done well if the developers launched this on mobile app stores instead of Steam, which isn't for mobile apps. 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

The game features lazy low-polygon ""retro"" assets, making this look like a barely functional 3D game from the mid 2000s.  It's unclear why the developers weren't able to arrange high quality, high polygon count contemporary assets for the game, and also irrelevant... what matters is that this looks bad as a result of their decisions, a compromise PC gamers shouldn't have to put up with.

The controls can't be customised because the game has such a dumbed down, simplified interface that it's just iPhone screen tapping stuff.  The fact that the interface is this dumbed down might be seen as a problem in itself, however... this is a fairly shallow experience if you're the kind of gamer that likes to play games with deep, rich control schemes and interaction.  You'll get none of that here.

This looks and feels like a mobile app, but I wasn't able to find it on the app stores.  Maybe it was removed, maybe it was rejected by Apple and Google (they do have more rigorous quality standards than Valve does for Steam, after all).

Regardless, for all intents and purposes ""Elementary My Dear Majesty!"" might as well be a mobile app, it has the same limitations and dumbed down qualities.  It's impossible to recommend such a game to PC gamers.  We don't spend all this money building gaming rigs so we can pretend they're iPhones and play games that might as well be mobile apps.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this only appears around the same time that trading cards were applied to the game... so this is just card idlers getting their cards and moving on.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Elementary My Dear Majesty! is relatively cheap at $2 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, and the questionable ethical nature of the developer and/or their associates (as outlined above), this is impossible to recommend.  Because this is the kind of game you can just play for free on mobile phones, it's impossible to recommend anyone should pay money for the same experience on Steam. You should try it if you're into hidden object games. nice game 10/10",0.0001807030766852272

830451,Call of Duty¬Æ: Black Ops III - Zetsubou No Shima Zombies Map,dlc,False,"1 May, 2018","Action, Adventure","In this installment of the epic Zombies saga, the Origins characters head to 'Zetsubou No Shima', a tropical island overrun with mutated experiments that are hell-bent on destruction. Get a bonus of 5 vials of Liquid Divinium to help in fighting off the undead.","i know people hated it but the easter egg was too easy, aside that i loved it. first map i hit round 150+ this is fun but only sometimes my favorite DLC for BO3. most grounded Easter egg next to origins. meaning you progressing the EE/unlocking weapons feels immersive and like your actually doing things that matter around the map. look up plant recipes. and the spider bait guide to get the most out of the map. you can get infinite quick revive/ammo if you make the eggs over and over again. which you are going to need to get over round 50. 

Issues: 

you need the other 3 morons on your team to get their challenges done to beat the EE. which can be nearly impossible in public games.

SPOILER: the watering the plant step underwater is ""rebarded"" 3/5 Zetsubou No Shima is fun that fucking plane that i hate The absolute best DLC this game has to offer. The set up is fun and has many tasks to keep your engaged, and the Easter egg is very fun and rewarding with the cut scene. The atmosphere is also really great. 10/10 Underrated map honestly Acitivision is a bunch of scumbags that killed the H2M mod. They can suck my left and right nuts for their greedy actions. Eat sh*t you creatively bankrupt money hungry losers This isn't a bad map at all, it's just simply not for me as most of it feels like a chore rather than a fun experience though it does have alot of good ideas. 

Positives:
- Plant System both a positive and negative but it's worth it just for the revive plant alone as it helps alot during Solo
- Skull of Nansapwe should've been the wonder weapon as it's that good 
- Underwater combat is really interesting and surprisingly works nicely, welcome addition 
- Hiding an OP perk (Widows Wine) behind a boss fight is a perfect example of progression, as locking an OP item or ability behind a boss fight, quest etc should be normalised as it's a perk that built into BO3 so much so that it's a crutch perk so again i wish they did this more often. 
- Spider Boss Fight is simple and easy to access aswell as to fight. 
- Playable Spider 
- KT4 Wonder Weapon being built with the map is a unique idea that again i wish more maps did it often (using it for spores for speed boost, miniboss, plant watering, etc)
- Spider rounds, another positive and negative but the positive being they act unique and are an interesting idea which i prefer compared to the done to death Hellhound Rounds, they also change the map by webbing up doors, paths and perks which makes them unique to go up against.

Negatives: 
- Plant System both a positive and negative but it's worth it just for the revive plant alone as it helps alot during Solo
- Pack a Punch requires a guide in order to figure it out, a casual would be able to find atleast 2 parts while the spider webbed part would be unclear as that's literally the only time in the entire map you need to knife webbed corpses to find a part. 
- Thrasher's feel like they have the Shangri La spawn system but 10x worse, as they spawn literally every round sometimes 3-4 at most and you earn no points from killing them which makes it feel so tedious and annoying
- The maps atmosphere, story and level of detail kinda falls short due to BO3s colourful engine aswell as lack of sound design that makes it not feel scary or even creepy which is a shame since that's what they were going for but doesn't hit the mark at all mainly since the reason Verruckt was so powerful horror wise was due to its atmosphere, sound design and lack of firepower/powerful perks to get you going making you feel underpowered in a haunted location. If you make the player OP or even powerful then any and all fear is lost. 
- The Easter Egg itself is underwhelming as it's literally just fixing an elevator, which sounds underwhelming because it is as it's a really tedious and boring experience due to being a massive fetch quest, the zipline part is really bad on Solo since if you mess it up just once then it's Game Over and all progress is lost due to an underpolished/clear step on how to jump off the zipline.(example would be it doesn't say ""Press F to jump off zipline"", just that simple idea would fix the entire steps problem) 
- The Easter Egg as mentioned has to do with fixing the elevator which unlocks a new area, on a new playthrough that elevator nor area is unlocked. Both should be unlocked right away as a reward for doing the easter egg exactly how BO2 did it with the pylons changing colour to indicate EE completion. 
- Easter Egg requires a specific gobblegum (Anywhere But Here) yet it never tells you, hints or even gives a free gum as a way to signal it 
- Spider rounds, another positive and negative but the negative is their hitbox being really bad when it comes to knifing so it feels awkward 
-  KT4 Wonder Weapon Upgrade required you to look up a guide since it doesn't tell you there is an upgrade aswell how the steps on how to do it. The hitbox on the hidden plant seed underwater is horrible to the point where you're able to get stuck and drown which is really unfair. 
- 95% of the map with or without EE, is just finding/building parts as a way to setup such as the shield, gas mask, KT4, planting seeds, watering seeds etc which is why the map feels so mixed as it's not bad, it just doesn't execute them in a way that's fun or satisfying. 

If Steam had a ""mixed"" option i'd select that but i choose negative since i don't really have a reason to go back to the map and if most of the setup process is finding/building items rather than killing zombies then i'm not interested in playing the map at that point.",0.06519551486764599

Id would gladly purchase additional chapters if they exist or come to steam. Highly recommended. Short and does not read itself. That makes no sense to me. It can be played again, and my kid enjoyed it, but she doesn't read yet, I truly do not understand why you would not have voiced the story.....

Simple controls, colorful graphics... this isn't going to win any Game of the Year awards, but young kids can have a lot of fun. It's great practice on how to use a mouse to control a cursor, so it's a good fine motor activity, as well! A great game for 5-6 year olds to learn to read and use the mouse and do some puzzles. Very quick game. But worth 3 bucks. I was looking for a game where my 6yr old could practice mouse skills without any pressure and this was perfect. The added reading practice really kept their attention. The story was fun and the animation is great.

Randomized bosses, mobs, 300+items, 50+weapons and spells, Conquer the galaxy in 60 minutes!","This is one of the strangest games I've ever played. The world map is truly amazing - sensory overload of textures, shaders, VFX, and animations. It has a truly unique visual style, and dozens of complex interlocking systems. It's also barely playable. If the dev is reading this, first thank you, and secondly please fix the bug that puts me inside of the giant woman when I die. I have to hard quit the game each time. This game really needed more time to cook and probably even more playtesting on top of that. It has potential from how it's set up, but it's a mess of technical issues which really barred me from even playing the game. The game's graphics settings is pretty standard, but the worst part of it is the fact that the game doesn't actually save anything you actually change in the menu. It appears to change when you're in the title menus, but once you get into the game itself it goes to the default settings and acts as if you never changed anything. It has gamepad support, but half of the time it doesn't work and will force you to use your mouse which in turn will sometimes make you not able to use your gamepad again until you restart the game from the main menu. The bindings for the gamepad also seem to be massively broken, as the buttons you press do not do the action that it says it does in the menu, and I even remapped the buttons to see if it fixed anything but it felt like it removed me ability to even punch with my fists? Before remapping melee defaulted to the left stick button for some reason but after I set it to RB/RT, it just seems I lost my ability to even melee attack.
In terms of other things I've noticed in the little time I've played the game, all the NPCs I've met say the same thing of ""Want to gamba?"", and in one of the stores there's an item in there several different times with a broken description that just has lines of code in its description,
I know I went into this with lower expectations because of how everything about it seemed too good to be true and with how suspicious a lot of it seemed, but it greatly disappoints me how I can't even play the game long enough to even see if the things in the trailer and this store page are even true to begin with. I can deal with this being a meme of a game if they at least polished out the technical issues so it can be playable,
Update: I've managed to play a bit more, and I'm starting to notice that certain mechanics for the game just don't seem to work or require you to interact with something but there's no indication of that. Restoring my keybinds to default also didn't fix my controls, as I still cannot attack when I press the keys that are bound to attack.
I'll update this if these issues get fixed so I can actually give the game a review based on the content in it.",-0.027331349206349203

However this issue isn't a kind that gives frustration, it makes the game super easy,bland and boring. Literally every level is just couple of enemy types placed around randomly. There is no thought behind enemy placements at all,they are just there and creator doesn't do anything interesting with them. Boss fights are quite bland as well. They have one or two specific attacks and keep repeating those. I especially find the chicken boss's laser attack quite lame. It always shoots at the exact same place. Had like 100 mins in the game and already got all achievements. Achievements like ""kill all enemies"" is not fun nor anything skillful. Also you want people to beat the game with each character even though they all work exactly same? That's not good. So overall game has serious design issues and offer nothing interesting. Just a bland run and gun game. So, this tries to be a Contra clone, but there are a couple issues with it. First, there's a time limit per level. This seems unneeded as it ruins the idea of strategy as you feel you need to rush the level. Second, ammunition is limited and requires pickups to main anything besides your base weapon, so you will run out if you do an auto fire type setup. Third, bullets can at times blend into the background; making bullets harder to miss than needed. This is painfully apparent in level 2.

It's not that this is a horrid game, but there are better options out there. I definitely have to recommend Biolab Wars! 2ndBoss managed to capture the look and feel of games like Contra, and just stuck to the basics.

The gameplay is spot on, the visuals are fantastic and the soundtrack complements the on screen action perfectly.

I had a blast playing through this and if you are a fan of run and gun games I'm sure you will too. Bio Lab Wars is a $1 Contra clone. It's not bad either. Not many games can say they have a chicken that shoots lasers as a sub weapon. Really Love this game reminds me of a Super Contra or Midnight Resistance game on steroids! Hell Yea!!! I am the world record holder. un juego entretenido estilo Contra muy retro. uninspired, lazy design Good callback to the NES run and Guns like Contra great soundtrack. Levels and bosses offer an ok challenge. Only issue is trying to beat the game without dying. it's a challenge with the flying enemies and the 1 hit kill lazer in Level 7. Great little gem, all the better for being a very playable contra clone with a health bar. Needs patching it so that a little health is lost when you fall down a hole rather than a whole life. My only gripe with it.",-0.052669713718820885

Collect items, build buildings, fend off enemies from your pile, and as always fulfil the eternal hunger of The Flumf.","this game seems ready for mystery and unsettling spoiler it's not  killed 4 hours on this and it was okay buy this if you need some mindless unsettling weirdness otherwise pass I wish I passed I'm kinda torn on leaving a Thumbs Down on this game. On one hand, I did have fun mindlessly playing it for about 2 hours. It does have a lot of charm with the kind of spooky dark vibes that you can see in the trailer, and progressing through the game feels satisfying... Up to a certain point.

Firstly, there NO ENDING to this game (just a screen and achievement similar to when you pass the first couple ""levels""), which was extremely disheartening. I thought I'd be rewarded with some kind of lore for grinding through this game, but no. Just a 2.5 second screen, and then it's back to the game... Except at this point there's no real objective anymore.

The game is also filled with various glitches. Not only does it crash randomly sometimes, there are also glitches that effect the gameplay. Sometimes you'll find that you're not able to build various buildings - for absolutely no reason. If you close the game and open it back up, you MIGHT find that you're able to build it now. Randomly. No rhyme or reason to this.

Another glitch: When you complete your first main objective (I'm being vague intentionally here), your workers will retain their upgrades. If you close the game and open it back up, you'll have to upgrade them again. Not sure which part of this is a glitch, but I don't think they're supposed to stay upgraded tbh.

The game does have its charm and it's only $3 or less. Try it if you want despite the seemingly harsh review. I think I just had high hopes for this game because it looked so intriguing, so maybe I am being a bit critical overall. I would be willing to change my review if the dev fixed some of the problems I mentioned... First and foremost the lack of a real ending.

Anyway, if you want to get a better idea of how the game plays, and maybe laugh at my stupidity, check out [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwxT4WM0CXM]my video[/url] of the game. -- > https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwxT4WM0CXM

761190,1010,game,False,"13 Dec, 2017","Indie, Simulation, Strategy",1010 - is an addictive puzzle game with a original storyline,"Squares are cool.         :l Simple and classic game with a horrific ui. 1010 is an asset flip, what Valve calls a ""fake game"".  The ""developer"", Walkboy Studio, took a tutorial for making a 1010 game (most likely the [url=https://codecanyon.net/item/blocks-puzzle-html5-game-construct-23/22640472]Blocks Puzzle[/url] tutorial/demo/game asset pack from the real developers, redfoc), changed the name, and dumped the result onto Steam.  They're attempting to scam people into buying this, so they can get your money for someone else's work.

This certainly gets branded as an asset flip because it's indistinguishable from other Construct2/HTML5 1010 game tutorials... there's no reason to believe this is an original creation, and even in the extremely unlikely chance it is, [i]it's indistinguishable from the stock assets out there.[/i]

And that's really what the problem with asset flips is all about.  Sure, the intellectual bankruptcy of taking someone else's work and putting your own name on it is bad, but as consumers, what matters is that this product has no real value, it's not sincerely made, it's a knock-off.

The original 1010 game is made by Zynga and is a mobile app.  But this is not from Zynga.  It's absolutely unethical to take someone else's entire game (even if the underlying code may be slightly different) and try profit from that. 

The products that result from asset flips aren't ""real"" games.  They lack depth and content, because they're just simplistic copies of demos or tutorials.  In this case, ""Blocks Puzzle"" is just a game template that creates a simple mobile/browser ""1010"" minimalist block placement game made using the Construct2 engine/HTML5, and doesn't have any merit as a proper, fully fledged PC game, so this copy+paste of it can't be recommended.

Asset flips don't involve any professional game development.  Sure, sometimes they may change a few cosmetic things, swap out different assets etc, but at heart it's functionally identical to the asset they're ripping off.

Asset flips like this are harmful to the gaming industry and to Steam because they reduce the visibility that sincerely made indie games should have, and make it harder for gamers to find real games from genuine developers.  It gives genuine amateur/indie developers a bad name.

Don't reward this morally bankrupt, unethical behaviour from Walkboy Studio.
 Based on the modern classic by Zynga, this version is really annoying in comparison. While the premise is the same, here are my issues with it:

- The UI is unintuitive trash compared to the mobile version by Zynga
- The three pieces you're offered float up and down passively at the bottom of the screen which is really annoying and there's no way to turn that off
- The volume has no slider, just on or off
- The piece placement noise sounds like a car door being slammed shut which is such an aggressive noise for a game like this, especially with everything else about the aesthetic seeming to angle more toward magical and cute
- There's no noise when you clear a line like in the Zynga mobile version, which has a cute little discordant jingle that's fun to listen to. This version, line clearing is just dead silent

If you enjoy mobile games, get the one mentioned or use a different PC version. This one isn't worth the dollar, especially when you can get similar online for free. chill If you like puzzle games, this is one of my favorites! It's very much like the Mobile version, except a bit more challenging because it has one extra shape! It's always fun trying to see how high of a score you can get. Fun! jebal cik interesanti The music is nice, but the exact same game is available elsewhere on the web for free as a browser game.That said, there's nothing wrong with this one.

It's barely a cousin of Tetris; a distant relative at best. There's no pressure here from time, anyway. Three pieces appear at the bottom of your screen. You must place all three, and you're then presented with three more. That fact makes it a little more challenging than some of the browser versions I've seen, where when you use one piece, it's replaced with another. Here, there's always the thought that maybe you should reserve room for that one giant piece that sometimes shows up because you never know when it will show up. 

It's a good time-waster, a great game for when you're on the phone and just need something to idly do while you listen, and, then again, you can also approach it with concentration and try to get a great score. 

Recommended because it *is* fun, and cheap, and it might be easier to just keep this version in the Steam library than to keep a bookmark to a free version. It controls really weird, and makes it pretty uncomfortable to play. But aside from that it's a fun game.... but it's also got like 10 free ports on the internet

probably a 3/10 for the pure fact that it's bugs make it uncomfortable, and it's kinda a waste of a dollar",0.055369189342403625

919260,Final Upgrade,game,False,"6 Dec, 2022","Indie, Simulation, Strategy","Help humanity to spread throughout the cosmos by exploring new worlds, building space factories and setting up trade routes. Research advanced technologies to increase efficiency and unlock new paths of development. Fight off other artificial intelligences in your goal to reach the Final Upgrade!","Quite bad!  I'm like half an hour into the tutorial and it hasn't given me any reason why I might want to continue.  I have had corporate HR webinars that were more engrossing than this. Current Playtime: 250hrs
3.5 Playthroughs
- Tutorial
- 30hr (Time Trial) Challenge
- Iron Will Achievement (Super Hard Mode)
- Disassembler + Science Challenge (abandoned)

Outside of the base game mode, this is a logistics/resource management gem. Not for the faint of heart. Building and rebuilding the factories because of territorial acquisition or population demand was a constant. It was annoying how often I would take a blueprint and tweak it slightly for the new circumstance, but really easy, once you got use to the QoL opportunities listed below. There were more than a few times I self-destructed the entire factory because I needed to move some components over a few tiles to make room for a new addition.

The various challenge modes were really good. Forced me to actively plan and work within constraints as opposed to traditional factory games where the answer is just ""Increase Production!"" Had to abandon my Disassemble + Science challenge run because it was just too brain breaking; Not even sure I had enough of the right base components to make everything needed.

The Factory component of the game is uninspiring and relatively bland.
- Every recipe is a single unit of one or two inputs
- There's no method to increase belt speed
- While there's a building which allows priority outputs, there is no functionality for priority inputs
- Transport is always 1:1; Teleporter A to Teleporter B; Transport Route from Planet A to Planet B; No method to indicate a pool of resource sources and a pool of resource consumers and let the game sort it out for you. (Which could be construed as a positive?)

Combat system is weak
- Constant friendly fire
- Ships will automatically reorient themselves such that they block other ship's firing lines.
- Weapon strength/effectiveness progresses to the top tier laser being the cream of the crop, and should be rushed, removing any strategy for the mixing/matching weapon types. However, lasers seem to have had a bug where they will occasionally stop firing (but still consume energy) when ships teleport in/out. I did encounter this issue even though its reported as resolved.
- Had an issue (bug?) where ships I built new would be considered not combat ready even though they had full ammo and energy. Had to manually order and abort a shot to get the gun to take in ammo? Then on first combat with enemy, they would retreat with the indication they were no longer combat ready? Sending them to fight a second time usually cleared the issue.

Construction needs some QoL updates
- Tooltip often covers desired placement location
- Nothing can be placed floating in space, so cut/paste can be a hassle; Building inward to the Space Elevator is difficult
- Cut operation takes place immediately, so make sure you place it somewhere if the desired placement wasn't actually ready, like no or wrong connection back to the main platform; Otherwise the clipboard is cleared and you've lost that factory bit
- Paste is always a Merge operation, even if overwriting something else; Hope you didn't have any errant belts filling holes in your paste
- Blueprints will overwrite manual changes; Ex: A station is linked to a blueprint with a belt going outward. In this particular station, the belt was deleted and now a new built is being built in the inward direction. Once the belt is constructed, it will be going outward.

Quirks
- Liquids and pipes behave vastly different than solids and tubes
- Pipes push near infinite amount of liquid per second, tubes max at 2/sec
- Pipes connect to everything they touch, no control over direction
- Liquids can flow between buildings through adjacency, solids cannot
- Resources can be transported via Manually defined Routes (specifying ship placement and lining tubes up across structures to let resources flow), Automated Routes (Transport ships teleport resources from across the map and fly off), Teleportation Nodes (skip the ship, extend that pipe across spacetime)
- The game pushes towards Teleportation Nodes because they consume the least energy, however, I found the Manually defined Routes the most intriguing (and tedious)
- Mining, while required at the start of the game, is very quickly outpaced and becomes a negative efficiency, used only as a temporary stopgap or to limp along with a desperate resource shortage; Each ship is limited to eight robot miners, they have terribly slow movement, and the ships want to give each other wide berths around a particularly tiny (regenerating) source of raw ore.
- None of the challenges and few of the achievements are able to be completed in ""easy"" mode; So the game hasn't really started, the tutorial ended after 10-30 minutes, and you've got 20-30 hours until you reach ""the end"". I think the UI is atrocious... especially the tech tree where everything pops and flickers into view as you click on it so there's a bunch of difficulty making sense of where you are or where you came from. 

It also irks me that you are building everything for ""colonists"" but you never actually see any nor does the game have any colony elements..

Otherwise it's very cool with lots of potential.. I'll wait for some more updates before playing it more I wanted to like this game so badly but it feels quite convoluted and had a bad tutorial. A bit rough, and missing a few QOL features from other games, but an interesting and different take on automation and crafting I really enjoyed this for a long time but there are some issues. It gets tedious to actually finish a game. Combat is poorly explained and poorly implemented. The default setting have counterattack turned off, in which case its just a slog. If counterattack is on which is needed for many achievements that means once attacked the enemy simply spawns fleets from thin air until you take all of their sectors and some of those sectors require 1 mil energy instead of the 100k which was the highest prior to this. This is a problem if you haven't built a massive fleet and saved up millions of energy before ever starting. Then you realize the map generation is a bit wonky. You can turn on the map reveal without penalty and try a few generations to see that several maps are much harder than others. Design decisions don't feeling meaningful; once you get the basics, it's just busywork. Fun factory game An amazing game for fans of automation and space exploration!

Final Upgrade has been a true gem for me. The gameplay is so well-designed that it‚Äôs hard to step away. Building space factories, creating trade routes, and researching new technologies ‚Äî all of this brings immense satisfaction.

What impressed me the most is the depth of the automation systems. The developers did an excellent job balancing complexity and engagement ‚Äî the game constantly motivates you to improve your bases and expand your production network. The graphics are pleasant, and the soundtrack perfectly complements the space theme.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys automation, strategy, and exploration elements. It‚Äôs definitely worth your time!

 I got about 5 hours in before I hit the factorio style infinite treadmill of upgrades and factory expansions. The game plays nicely and feels good to develop your own prototypes. Unfortunately I'm just not in the mood to scale infinitely right now, lmfao. From my experience playing it, I would judge the game to be worth 5$, 10$ if you're into the factory and space colony genre.",0.005344016713879716

The element-mixing system is a neat quirk and it's fun to experiment with all the combinations and find your favorite weapon. Good stuff! Really enjoyable premise and artstyle! The game mechanics are a clear love letter to the original Kirby games, and the unlockable power-ups and enemies are very creative. I also like how the difficulty isn't too hard, but it's not a breeze either; boss challenges are hard, but fair. I picked up this game because my daughter thought it looked fun. It's a fun platformer with cute character design. My daughter and i would take turns playing. I would kill everything and she would try to jump out of the world. Fun times. The only issues I've had so far is getting stuck in place at the beginning of one of the early boss fights and turning into a ball when i didnt want to. The second one could just be my controller being old though. Virballs is a very challenging and fun game!  Highly recommended for all ages! The balls are cute! I like the collecting aspect that is paired with the different types of ammo you can use in the game! The bosses can be pretty challenging so you definitely need to utilize the correct type of balls for each. ;) [h1]This is a strange and adorable game![/h1]
I love the [b]Floobers[/b] that are the rescue objective in some of the levels. The sound effects are spot on for the visuals and the music is epic.  Boss fights get more and more intense as the spectacular boss animations grow more complicated with each world. There are many different weapons between the virball elements and the cores that are added with each world completed, and the switching menu is good at showing that matrix.
The game play is smooth, supporting a run and gun or steady assault style of play. Since anything you destroy gives back health to some degree, it's possible to choose to destroy for health or to claw the tiny virballs to get more ammo of their type.
Anyway, it's a solid game and well worth the price. Clever core ""Enemies are ammo"" design with a lot of fun combinations and weapon choices. Worth checking out. GG! Fun as heck!! Got the game because I know one of the devs and the game doesn't disappoint one bit :33 Cute virballs and the  jumpy guys you gotta save look so funny This has the spirit of the 3D platform adventure/shooter games of the PS1 and early PS2 era, and that's a good thing.
If you think to yourself ""Why is there nothing like spyro or ratchet & clank being made today?"", give this a try.

It's currently in early access, but the devs are highly communicative, running weekly streams, showing their pipeline, etc - I have confidence this is a team that will finish something, and not a pipe dream. lots of balls 10/10",0.17427469135802465

Probably the thing I like most about this game is the variety. Sixteen characters, each with three unique attacks, stories, endings, and character designs, keep me from tiring of Magical Fairy Force. Having a large variety of difficulty levels and multiplayer modes (which I wish had more online focus) only adds to the fun.

I also love a good chunk of the character design, especially in Queen Sugar and her nemesis. I got a lot of anime and vintage Street Fighter vibes from the sixteen characters, and how their unique stories are relationships to the characters are carried out.

802660,Bitcoin Or Bomb?,game,False,"22 Feb, 2018","Casual, Indie","You are playing for the FDB agent (Federal defense of the Bitcoins), and you need to find all the bitcoins, before the time runs out and the bombs explode","Wowzers! This sucks!

It boils down to a trial and error memory game. You have to guess where the bitcoin is, without hitting a bomb. Every time you pick the wrong object, you have to restart, so you have to keep testing to see where the bitcoin is. As the levels progress, there are more bitcoins and more options (or bombs) to choose from, so you have to memorize where each bitcoin is, through making mistakes, until you figure out the correct pattern to beat the level, awful game mechanic. There's also a time limit of like five seconds per level, leaving you no time to think and just react quickly.

I could hardly hear any music either, it was just deafening sounds playing throughout.

As per usual, if you want an actual good game, this isn't the one, 'cept if you want a +1 to your perfect games score. Bitcoin Or Bomb? is a memory puzzle game.

I played through the entire game and finished it in 6 minutes (failed the last level a lot, so that's around 3 to 4 minutes for the entire game if you don't...) Such short games shouldn't be accepted on Steam, this is just... ugh. So the goal of the game is to reveal all Bitcoins and avoid bombs. If you click on a bomb, the game stops and you have to restart. So it's just trial and error to guess where all Bitcoins are 1 by 1, then use your memory to remember where they are and click them in a row relatively quickly (there's a timer.) The music loops every times you die, and in this game you are supposed to die every few seconds, rendering the audio experience borderline torture.

Overall, avoid. It is not fun, 5-10 minutes long and just not worth your time. Bitcoin Or Bomb? is more minimal effort Russian shovelware polluting Steam and making gaming worse for everyone.  Once more, Ghost_RUS has used the childrens toy ClickTeam Fusion drag and drop game construction kit to make a ""game"", this time the game is just a blind minefield game, like minesweeper but without the clues.  Click on the green dots and try to remember which dots have a bitcoin pixel blob and which ones don't (the ones that don't reset the level).  That's all there is to it, it's just more Russian cash grab pollution.

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

A choice was made to use obsolete, decades old retro pixel ""art"" as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget or talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

Bewilderingly, the game doesn't include proper audio controls, so you can't turn off the annoying background music, you'll need to alt+tab out and stop the music using the Windows sound mixer.  This is obviously not okay and it's unclear why the developers chose not to include this basic feature.

The controls can't be customised because the game has such a dumbed down, simplified interface that it's just point and click stuff like a browser/Flash game.  The fact that the interface is this dumbed down might be seen as a problem in itself, however... this is a fairly shallow experience if you're the kind of gamer that likes to play games with deep, rich control schemes and interaction.  You'll get none of that here.

Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the Clickteam Fusion construction kit - the ""No-Code"" construction kit that ""Anyone can make games with!!"".  Including, you know, people who aren't game developers.  Which is a problem.  This is a very poor quality toolset sometimes used by amateur developers as it's free (so they don't have to pay for GameMaker Studio) and doesn't require advanced game development skills, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities (it's arguably worse than GameMaker Studio).  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.  So it's inappropriate when amateurs try to use these for profit, without any actual, real game development effort taking place.  This doesn't result in products that have any real meaningful value for gamers.

The very poor quality of this game puts it squarely on-par with ancient 1990's Flash/Java games, and given it's 2023 (and this was released not so far back in 2018), gamers and the industry expect and deserve better than this kind of low effort shovelware.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 3 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

While game reviews must be about the game, as this review has been, it's sometimes important for gamers to be aware when there's problems with the developers.  In this case, Nikita ""Ghost_RUS"", a Russian shovelware scam artist who routinely abuses Steam by polluting the marketplace with shovelware like this game.  Nikita ""Ghost_RUS"" continually sends a message of racism, bigotry, homophobia and hate speech through his games, in direct violation of Valve's guidlines for acceptable game content.  You can read more about it in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Sentinels_of_the_Store/announcements/detail/1663386372399476871]this article by the Sentinels of the Store[/url] curator group.

This is something I feel potential customers should be aware of for two reasons.  First, I understand completely that gamers may not want to buy games with such horrible, antihumanitarian messages of hate such as games from Nikita ""Ghost_RUS"".  Secondly, gamers must be aware that if Valve decides to do the right thing and enforce their policy against hate speech and bigotry in games, games such as this will be banned.  So, buying games from Nikita ""Ghost_RUS"" may be putting your money at risk.

Bitcoin Or Bomb? is relatively cheap at $1 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.

[b]Note:[/b] Because this is more of a ""joke"" game, intended to draw attention from controversy or in the hopes of going viral because it's ""so bad it's good"" (but it isn't good at all), there's nothing here to offer to serious gamers.  As usual, with most awful/joke games, all the comedians come out of the woodwork.  The vast majority of the reviews for this game are joke reviews, such as ""this game cured my cancer, saved my marriage, changed my life"" etc.  Because most of the reviews are as insincere as the game itself is, the positive review score for this game should be disregarded. Lame This game is very similar to Anime girl Or Bottle? but it comes with a memory version of puzzles.  You have to click all the circles until you find which ones are bitcoins and then select them all without blowing up to complete the level.  There are 15 levels which can take a person less than five minutes to complete.  Overall rating 1/10 based on price and the fact they sell you a MIDI soundtrack as DLC.  Not worth the time to play unless you are an achievement hunter for 100% completion. 1/10 This game is one of the most engaging ones ive played.

[i]These are all reskins of exactly the same game![/i]  What value is there in this spam/pollution glutting the Steam store for gamers?  This valueless copy + paste garbage is taking up marketing space for genuine indie developers who are doing the right thing.  It's harmful to the industry and to gamers.

The ridiculous price of the game ($5 USD) exceeds that of 12 Labors of Hercules, worse gameplay, worse graphics.  I didn't recommend 12 Labors because that's a lousy tablet game on PC, and this is worse... so no recommendation from me. One of the most polished and vibrant games in the genre, they really upgraded every aspect of it. Enjoying it so far and definitely recommend it when it hits a dollar to people wondering if it's worth it. The gameplay is well designed and you can tell the developers have put a lot of thought into it after creating so many of these types of games.

EDIT: Level 13 is INSANE! Took a good hour to 3 star it. Giving the game a break after that but looking forward to picking it back up again.

EDIT 2: After completing 24 levels now, basically the difficulty of each level is in the wrong order. One level will be super easy while the next level is super difficult. It doesn't ruin the experience but I just wish that's how it was in order I guess. Still LOVING the game!

EDIT 3: I've now completed the game and I must let you know that once you get to level 40 the game gets SUPER hard to 3 star. You have to do everything perfectly to do it. Once you eventually get 3 stars after replaying the level countless times, it's all worth it. Level 46 is by far the hardest level in the game. Took me 18 times and I finally 3 starred it.",0.016677910833754982

Nice game. Need some fixes but, can be really fun with friends.  [h1] This is a party game at its finest! [/h1]

It really doesn't get much better than this. 

The visuals are stunning and the map is very well crafted. It offers an interesting detective/social deduction gameplay, which got me thinking and second guessing a lot. In a good way. I felt unneasy because of being watched, I felt the pressure of finding out who is the bad guy. And it's fun to experience these feelings in any game.

There is a single player mode as well, very good for training and learning the map. But multiplayer is where it's at! Grab your friends, make a lobby, join a voice call and prepare to: laugh, argue, being surprised, deceive, being confused. What a rollercoaster and I loved it.

It's really amazing that you can customize the game in a lot ways, each game can feel entirely different and unique. Different number of players, tasks... You can always keep it fresh. And there is still so much more that can be added.

About a half hour of game play if you use the auto feature. Poor value. Pure Garbage! The game can be finished under an hour. The artwork is generic. S*x scenes are pure joke.

Total NSFW scenes are 4 or 5 total and the entire game will take you less than 15 minutes to read through (the story is not finished). My advice is save your money or wait until the game comes to $1.00. My issues are three fold. 

1. I completed the story in just over an hour. The inappropriate scenes do not flow, they have buttons to change the pace of the repetitious action. 
2. The story is actually interesting, kind of... The grammar is not excessively bad, but many words are miss used. Obviously put into English by someone that has English as a second language. They did not understand the vernacular of the period either.

860020,EXFIL,game,False,"11 Dec, 2024","Action, Indie, Simulation, Strategy, Early Access","EXFIL delivers raw tactical FPS intensity with no distractions. No loot grinding, no gimmicks‚Äîjust pure realism. From the co-designer of 'Squad,' this milsim tests your strategy, comms and teamwork in high-stakes, single-life matches. Will your squad rise to the challenge?","I will ask for a refund, there is no one playing online. Empty servers. For my persona view, these creators are overwhelmed putting hands on so many unfinished games that by the end of the day causes delays on every single one of them.  Good graphics, looks promising, but please do not release an early access peace of crap to have a character going around on some empty worlds. 

Yes, the game looks great, but anyone can put Unreal Engine 5 characters in empty worlds with IA or downloadable characteristics and Procedural Programming. please. There is a lot of potential here, and I hope that by the time Early Access ends, I can have a positive recommendation.

But I bought this on the back of the AI update, expecting to be able to play ""Single Player Multi-Player"" (basically, I wanted an offline game with bots).

But the AI release only created bot opposition - there's no friendly bots on your team, so its you against an enemy force instead of you+your team against them.

Feels very lonely and one-sided. EXFIL is a pretty fresh take on the extraction shooter genre. There isn't any loot, there isn't a hideout and you don't even buy any weapons or gear. The second you load into the game you're basically ready to go. You already have access to everything in the arsenal, although the some of the weapons are faction specific (which I'm not the biggest fan of in this game due to there being like 6 total weapons). You don't lose any of your stuff when you die, which is really dope because I hate losing everything though that's the whole point of an extraction shooter lol. There are a lot of options to customize the missions to your liking (i.e. time to extract, if there are enemy bots, when the mortar fire starts, blah blah blah), and I'm really looking forward to how much more configurable the missions will be in the future. Where this game really shines is in its customization, and I honestly believe in the future we as players will be able to make our perfect extraction shooter right here in EXFIL.

All of this menu stuff is great, but the actual gameplay is honestly not the best. Like it needs a TON of work. The gunplay is horrendous, there is absolutely zero weight to any of the guns and the recoil is a bit ridiculous. I do like how they simulate the ballistics though, kinda similar to Tarkov. The AI enemies are not great and they don't even seem to spawn in sometimes. This makes the game world very barren, especially with 0 players online (I had 8 server options to choose from and every one of them was empty). When the enemies do spawn in they either miss every shot or absolutely demolish you, but they seem to prefer not hitting their targets. They have a configurable difficulty level, but I haven't tested any level other than 3. I should also mention the performance, which is awful until you turn on frame generation. Once you turn it on though it should run great. I think this is all I have to say about the game right now. 

The whole gameplay loop is essentially just load in, grab intel, MAYBE see a group or two of bots, extract and boom. Raid finished in less than 10 minutes. It's not a blast but it's not necessarily boring. This game has a TON of potential, and while I don't recommend paying full price for it, definitely give it a go when it goes on sale or they do another free weekend. Overall rating 8/10

Exfil is an overwhelmingly positive addition to the extraction shooter genre, delivering a precision tactical experience that keeps players on edge. From the moment you drop into the battlefield, the game demands tactical thinking, rewarding those who plan their moves with calculated precision.
The gunplay is sharp and responsive, offering a satisfying balance between realism and accessibility. Every firefight feels intense, with the stakes rising as you push toward extraction. The thrilling engagements ensure that no match ever feels the same, keeping players hooked on the adrenaline rush.
As an early access title, Exfil shows immense promise. The foundation is solid, and it's easy to see where this shooter will go with continued development. With refined mechanics, deeper customization, and expanded content, Exfil has the potential to carve out a lasting legacy in the extraction shooter space.
For fans of tactical shooters, Exfil is a must-watch‚Äîa game that already delivers gripping action and tactical depth while hinting at an even brighter future. If you're looking for a high-stakes, immersive experience, this is one to keep on your radar.
 one of my favorite steam games not glazing but the developers are great the lead developer even joined my game. Though the game has his problems but it also is in  very early access 9/10 would recommend. nah actually i DEMAND GET THIS GAME NOW! and if you dont have enough money every 8 weeks the game devs do a free weekend event where they make the game free for a whole weekend so everyone can try it out for themselves. from the small details in the guns and map to how bullets bounce off walls this game is awesome i truly loved this game. I think the game is a great, realistic military game. You should try it out now and the developers know what there doing and what to add. I never buy 'Early Access' Steam games, but this is an exceptional case. I bought the Founders Supporter Edition, because the Developer has shown commitment to finish and polish the game.
 Even in its current early state, Exfill shows serious promise. 

The foundation is strong:  
- tactical gameplay with up to 4 spec-ops teams ( competitive aspect )
- enemy AI forces ( coop )
- drones!!!
- a few good maps for the start ( I bet there will be more! )

It‚Äôs rough around the edges‚Äîsome balancing issues, occasional bugs‚Äîbut that‚Äôs expected at this stage.

What stands out most is the potential. The atmosphere is intense, the extraction-based design keeps the stakes high, and when it clicks, it really clicks. If the devs keep up the pace and listen to the community, Exfill could become something special.

One to keep on your radar. fun game, as any early access, still going through the motions. The concept and future additions to the game are what keep me attached. Multiple tourneys and different gameplay options are a plus. Solo or Coop against AI, PVPVE, and even PVP. Big hopes for this and cant wait to see more currently dead, many servers but none of them have anyone, missing objects for certain animations, mission sounds for certain reloads, janky gunplay at best.",0.08891849434579022

1842510,Mechanibot,game,False,"31 Aug, 2022","Action, Strategy","In this tactical rogue-like auto battler, you'll build your unique team of robots and keep them alive as they fight. Battle through waves of enemies as you travel from planet to planet on a mission to fix the sun. Strategize, protect, survive. A Mechanibot's wrench never rests.","This is a simple but very enjoyable little game. At first I had trouble enjoying it as I had to micromanage the robots in a frantic way, which was not very enjoyable. Two things helped me get past that. One is holding down the grab button to let me move all of them at once, the other was coming up with a consistent strategy that I was aiming for with the right robots and upgrades to execute it; and then sticking with it. I found the game easier and more enjoyable after that. It is a fun, interesting, nice, and short game. Nice little game. Worth the little price tag it has. It entertained me for the time I played. Yes. This is game should be called manual battler. And this game should be playable with a mouse. Best 15 hours spent

The game is very cheap for how fun it is. Surprisingly every strategy you can think of will most likely work to complete a run. When completing a run, the game offers more difficulty modifiers from enemies dealing more damage to having wrenches spawn less often. There is also a story that takes place with enjoyable characters. The story is not too long nor forced on the player. There's also an ""infinite"" mode where it turns the game to a more last stand type game where enemies almost always and the store is always available. Enemies in the infinite mode also progressively get faster and bigger. Moving to the units, no two units are alike. Every unit has a primary color/class with most having a unique secondary color/class. This allows a mix match of units rewards players for exploring combinations of unused units. If I had a complaint about the game, it would be the awkward controls for mouse and keyboard. The controls themselves are not bad. The issue I have rather is when I have my cursor over the shops gui or settings and I attempt to cycle through with a or d it uses the cursors position and moves the selection back to where the cursor is. You can use the mouse to buy from the shop, it is however not used in the actual gameplay of the game. The issue is a nitpick honestly the easy solution I found was shoving the cursor off to the corner of the screen and forget I even have a mouse. Everything else about the game is great. Super fun mini manager. Great to pick up for a while and then take breaks between rounds. And the art is amazing! One of my favorites Really cool take on the auto battler format while giving the player much more agency! Feels similar to a tower defense but with much more active player input.
Runs are quick and aren't too punishing if you buy the wrong Robots at first.
It took me just over 9 hours to 100% the game and get the true ending which is a good length for such an inexpensive little game!
Excited to see more from Jon Nielsen! Mechanibot is a rogue-like with a rather unique take on the auto battler formula. You start the game with three coins which are used at the store where you are presented with random options to buy or upgrade the robots that will make up your team. Each robot you add to your team will have one or two classes assigned to them that broadly defines their role, and fielding enough robots of the same class gives a specific bonus to the entire team.

Your job during combat is to keep your little robot friends alive while they battle it out with the enemy. Before you start the round, you are given information on where the enemies are going to spawn in and danger zones where you can't place your robots with out them immediately and steadily taking damage. You place your robots accordingly and then can start the round.

Where this game diverges from other arena-based auto battlers that I'm familiar with is in the active participation of the player throughout combat. You continue to run around the field as the mechanibot during combat and can pick up your otherwise immobile robots and move them around to keep them safe. In fact, it is required that you frequently move them around in order to keep them alive. There are more tanky robots that don't mind taking hits from regular enemies, but even they can get overwhelmed if they're ganged up on enough and none of your robots want to take more than a couple direct hits from bosses and even mini-bosses. The difficulty therefore comes from constantly micromanaging your robots placement in levels that are increasingly full of danger that they have no chance of withstanding if left in the same place for too long.

In addition to robots, you are also given a random selection of items every few levels that modify your entire team for the rest of the run. They can do things like increase healing, give extra projectiles, etc. What results is a highly engaging auto battler with a ton of potential variety in each run.

I've put just over 11 hours into the game and definitely feel like I got more than my money's worth given the generously low price. This just feels clumsy and frantic in a way I really don't enjoy.",0.09004794086189434

945680,Here Be Dragons,game,False,"30 Jan, 2020","Adventure, Indie, Strategy","Here Be Dragons is a satirical turn-based strategy game featuring unique &quot;living map&quot; graphics, where you lead a group of crazed captains and eradicate legendary monsters in order to allow Christopher Columbus the discovery of the New World.","It is a fun enough game. It deserves better reviews than it has at the moment. ""Here be dragons"" is unique in many ways, being everything, but not what I expected. And if you're open-minded, that is very positively. The artworks are aesthetically - I like the way everything looks like an old map. When I first saw the scenes with the governor and the walking on the city maps, I expected some kind of management or adventure game, which it isn't. These are - as far as I can see - only fixed sequences to drive the plot. In a humorous way. The gameplay itself is not a roguelike or open-world, but 'campaign'-driven, with campaign meaning some battles in a row, between which I can temporarily upgrade my ships, meaning to add a point for defense for example. The battles itself are the main part of the game, difficult even on 'fun'-difficulty, and being puzzle-like and outcome heavily influencd by dice. And this random dice throwing adds hell of thrill to the game, and every dice-placement has to be well thinked over. You can place dice into abilities, upgrading the ships hull or cannons, and use bottles to change the results to trap enemies. This way, it becomes a puzzle-battler, something I didn't xpect, and highly like! A fun story line, the mechanics have a good challenge as well as a ""fun"" level which is really fun. Clean graphics and consistent experience throughout the game. Ultimately I think this game is mostly fine, but nothing good about it stands out, and playing it is a little annoying. For me, this is worse than being a bad game with a few good elements,but everyone engages with games differently, so you might not feel the same.

Here Be Dragons' core concept is that it's a dice placement board game simulating naval battles. Placing higher dice has more aggressive effects, but placing a high sum of dice causes you to act second in the initiative order. If you don't place dice, you take damage.

This creates kind of a neat push-and-pull in theory, where you're going for slow high damage on some turns and fast defenses on others, but the balance on the game isn't loose enough to let you play around. It's built more like a puzzle game, but a puzzle game where you routinely need to get certain combinations of dice. Which means one of the strongest moves you can make is just to restart a level and get a different initial roll.

There are some *very* light rpg elements, where you can upgrade your ships between maps, but only during certain short strings of levels. After the string is done, the upgrades reset. Moreover, you switch between characters and abilities after every string, and a lot of the characters don't feel great to use.

It's not *too* hard, but sometimes the rng just hands you a garbage starting roll, or it serves the enemy exactly the dice they need on a round where they have the initiative and they instantly focus down one of your ships, and there's no incentive not to immediately restart the level.

The art is solid, and the creatures look fun and detailed and menacing, but the writing did not land with me. It's a picaresque about bad people plundering and murdering and starting wars with the ocean, but it uses this setup to... quote Monty Python jokes.

Hey, man. Do you remember the Knights Who Say Ni? Yeah, that's SO funny. I'm gonna randomly say Ni and you're gonna laugh and we're all gonna laugh. Over and over and over again.

It feels stale and uninspired in a way that the rest of the game isn't.

I think as a board game, where you're physically interacting with the dice and paging through the rulebook and maybe there's pvp, this would be fun.

As-is, it felt more frustrating than enjoyable.

If you like dice placement games and puzzle games and want to turn your brain off a bit, it's probably not a bad pick on sale. But if you were hoping for a more robust strategy rpg like I was, this ain't that. The game is dirty with it's cheating RNG.
Avoid. combat is very random and difficulty spike is extreme Great game. Simple but difficult! Basically a perfect game as it does what it wants and is perfect for some quick but difficult fun! jokes landed flat and so much RNG. Without enough to influence the rolls I just loved the artwork and gameplay. Funny and a bit challenging too. 

Took me around 12 hrs to beat the game. Dreadful sea monsters are my thing. I wish to see more games like this one. The game is OK, but gets tedious quickly. The battles are unbalanced and depend on randomness way too much. The AI is likewise random. The story tries to be cute and funny, but it too becomes tedious very quickly.

Exploring the island, Jane must figure out what happened to Mike. Help them in this thrilling hidden object adventure!","A decent HOG (Hidden Object Game). If you like hidden object games, buy this one on sale. The game has a good story but very low resolution! Other than that, it's a great game for those who have mid-2000s or earlier computers with a smaller monitor. The problem with these older games is that some only display at 1024 by 768 resolution, which is way too small for my big 4K computer gaming rig. My monitor alone is a 43-inch class monitor (4K). It makes it very difficult to play an old game like this. The game displays a little window basically in the corner of the screen, which makes it very difficult to even see the little puzzles in hidden objects Other than that, it's a great game. It would be nice if Steam made it clearer when purchasing older games like this how they will display on our computers based on our computer hardware profiles, because otherwise we waste a lot of time and money on games we won't be able to enjoy.¬† Sea Legends: Phantasmal Light represents the best and worst of Hidden Object Game (HOG) technology circa 2010. Your experience will depend on your taste in HOGs. For me, the good point was it was very hidden object heavy. There were lots of hidden object screens and you needed to solve them more than once - a classic HOG experience of that era. Then there are the classic problems of that era - low resolution objects with poor translations and lots of backtracking to find where the hidden object puzzles are reactivating. There is also the classic problem of not having an in-game map, which means clicking back and forth through a dozen screens to find the object then get back to where you need to use it.

The story is stuck between the juvenile and mature in such a way to align with neither group. There are hallucinations of people dying that would be disturbing to younger players. Then, at the end of the bonus chapter, there is a giant floating purple head with a goofy voice that made me laugh out loud at how cartoonishly silly it was.

The art style can be ... incongruous. The characters appear to have been animated by different artists at different times. At one point, I was briefly confused when an angry old woman with a young boy's haircut leapt into the scene unexpectedly. Turns out it was supposed to be the main character's boyfriend. I don't think I was supposed to be laughing at that moment, at least not so loudly.

The game has no achievements to hunt, and if you don't like the ending of the bonus chapter, you have to replay the entire game to get a second guess at whether to choose right or left.

Taken as a whole, I cannot recommend Sea Legends: Phantasmal Light when there are so many better made modern and classic HOGs on the market deserving of $5. Got it on special. Thoroughly enjoyed the story, style and presentation. Spooky old man ghost on a lighthouse where things happen kinda fun. If it's on sale then it is worth getting.  
 This game took me a little over 3 and a half hours played casually, and I really enjoyed it. Excellent artwork and gameplay. There was a good range of puzzles with varying difficulties, although nothing overly hard. The story was interesting and the use of objects wasn't too linear so you often had a range of objects in your inventory to think through. Little disappointed with the final puzzle though (the one to do with the symbols). It had the opportunity to be something that you actually had to put a bit of thought into, and then it turned out to be an overly simple solution that breaks the immersion a little as the answer isn't something that the puzzle setter could have possibly known. good This game is HOG heavy (too many for me). I enjoyed the story and the puzzles, except for one that kept glitching and one that would not let me place a piece to begin solving it. Because of the latter issue, I could not finish the game. That's okay since it got rather tedious with the over use of hidden object scenes. The story was interesting enough to keep my attention until the jewel puzzle problem.

Don't waste your time. this game started good back when i 1st got it, but now it keeps crashing.. why does such a simple game crash? please optimise better I cant recommend this at this time. My issue with the game is the lack of clear, obvious feedback to the player in the early game what they are doing right or wrong. The visual cues are not obvious to lead you one way or another and there is barely any tutorial/guidance to explain it. It looks like it would be fun otherwise but with these limitations, I think only someone who REALLY wanted to get into the game would enjoy it.

853590,Goroons,game,False,"17 May, 2018","Casual, Indie",GOROONS is a teamwork-based adventure where you have to combine your unique skills and overcome tough-as-nails puzzle challenges.,"The TDLR here is I can recommend this game on the price point. I enjoyed my time playing. Your times may differ. I did not get to test this game in multiplayer.

This game is charming and minimalistic in art style, doesn't hold your hand when it comes to introducing you to puzzle mechanics, and encourages experimentation. You will need to think logically and make sure you're planning ahead and executing controls precisely, lest finding yourself in a frantic panic or unable to proceed and requiring to restart the whole level. Goroons is an older game from 2018.  It's a venerable 6 years old at the time of this review.

Goroons is a handheld (Nintendo Switch)/console game that's also been put on Steam as a bit of an afterthought, as it's very much designed for the handheld/console gaming audience.

There's a co-op focus to the game, so you need to co-ordinate with your friends to play this... I guess that's easier for the developer than making a compelling single player experience.  Creating content is hard!  Why bother?

Like I always say, if the only thing that makes a game fun is your friends, that just proves it's fun to spend time with your friends, and doesn't say much for the game at all.  You can play this single player, but it's the opposite of fun... and if you ask your friends to play this kind of garbage Nintendo Switch game on PC, you soon won't have any friends... that's a no-win scenario for this one.

The idea of the game is to move the 4 player blobs to the exit... each blob can morph, and you need to use the abilities of each morph to solve the puzzles/obstacles between you and the exit.  It's been done a hundred times or more, almost always better than this.  So much for gameplay. 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The game features simple, cartoony 2D graphics, of the type you normally expect to see in low effort mobile apps.  3D graphics programming does require a degree of skill and competence and unfortunately not all developers have the budget or talent to deliver this, despite 3D graphics cards hitting the mainstream in the 1990's.  Considering this is being evaluated as a PC game, having the graphics phoned in like this isn't going to result in a high quality, visually impressive game that PC gamers are used to seeing.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, left handed gamers or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

Because this is designed for handheld/portable gaming appliances, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the low power handheld gaming appliances that the game was designed for.  These are unfortunate compromises and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was a second thought for the mobile game developers.  The game is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for low power handhelds forces upon a game.  While this might run well on a Steam Deck, we must remember the vast majority of gamers here are gaming on PC.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 5 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 100,000 games for gamers to choose from, the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

So, should you buy this game?  Is this one of the best of the 100,000+ games on Steam?

Goroons is relatively cheap at $3 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  This is also competing with over 14,000 free games available on Steam, many of them far better than this paid product. Most ""cheap"" puzzle games are easily solved or the only challenge rests in overcoming the bugginess of the gameplay.  This is a nice exception for the genre.  The designers clearly spent time thinking through how the various Goroon mechanics could be used to create challenging puzzles.

There is some roughness to the game that could use some polishing on the edges, but at the price point this is a solid idea that was pretty well executed.  The game includes leaderboards that are sparsely populated - I have to say it made me sad to see that so few had played the game.  As long as you aren't expecting polish - this is a fun game for a couple hours of puzzles. Fun and challenging puzzle game. I played alone and beat it anyway. Played on Linux.

Divertido y desafiante juego puzzle. Lo jugu√© sola y lo di vuelta de todas maneras. Jugado en Linux. Very clever, funny and addictive puzzle platformer.
Co-op play is great. Love playing with my daughter. Good game in principle, but seems to have a bug that when two people are playing, the switching doesn't work properly and disables the other player - who can no longer switch to another character. The TDLR here is I can recommend this game on the price point. I enjoyed my time playing, it is short but worth the roughly ¬£1 per hour puzzle experience I had. Your times may differ. I did not get to test this game in multiplayer.

This game is charming and minimalistic in art style, doesn't hold your hand when it comes to introducing you to puzzle mechanics, and encourages experimentation. You will need to think logically and make sure you're planning ahead and executing controls precisely, lest finding yourself in a frantic panic or unable to proceed and requiring to restart the whole level.

Positive qualities include:
-Great art style with minimalistic controls, polished appearance.
-Relatively difficult puzzles and high quality level design.
-A sense of learning through puzzles without being force-fed information.
-Includes multiplayer (did not test).
-Worked very smoothly with very few bugs (already fixed by developers).

Negative qualities include:
-I slightly bumpy learning curve (although this could be a personal problem I had with particular levels).
-Sometimes confusing and slightly frustrating keyboard inputs with fairly punishing consequences (game was developed for controllers).
-Nice music but lacked variety.
-Relatively short gameplay time if you're a good puzzle gamer.
-Simplistic sound and graphics options.

It is a fun little game that has a few quarks so far and a great way to test vr gear when you are new to it.
I would only get it on 5$ sale though.  okay so ill admit its glitchy a little rough around the edges. sometimes it feels unfair how you died. but a super overlooked feature is that another player can play on your pc while in vr as drone. that is actauly so fun. im not gonna lie i played with my mom who's not technologically inclined and it was so intuitive she managed to do it, so it gets a good rating for helping me have fun with me mom after so many games just didn't, Like Lone Echo?  Wish it was a survival/building game? Well, this is the game for you. Lots of fun. I keep trying to like this game. I just cant. Every time I go out from the hab. Something hits the hab. I then dont have enough materials to repair it. I run of oxy then die. Then when I do get enough to repair it. I dont have any materials to build the quest tutorial plant box. While Im getting the material. The hab gets hit again. Then I dont have enough materials to fix it. Then I die becuase i couldnt eat any food.
Rinse, repeat. its pretty rough around the edges, but its just BARELY a correct, enjoyable game. ive played vr games kinda similar to this one before (like into the radius) but this one actually works by giving you actual objectives. theres a lot of strategy you have to implore to make sure you dont run out of power or oxygen which is something i do like. the main bulk of this game is divided into 2 parts: looting and scavenging for resources and gear, and building your base. its basically a zero g subnautica. there will be some light combat segments here and there, but its not too focused on this. i do like it how the game isnt so stubborn about the hardest to find resources and you can craft them if you dont want to just search and search for one specific rare thing. like i said however its not perfect, but to the games credit none of the problems are due to bad game design, just budget restraints. the game is a little cheaply made, the graphics are extremely simple, and all the stuff that floats around your space ship just stays there until it despawns and some newer thing appears. i would have preferred if the stuff would gradually drift towards your station, pass it, and then drift away. they would help me suspend disbelief and give me a visual indicator of how much time you have before something is too far gone. the game is really buggy and has been abandoned by the devs for years so its pretty likely that it wont get any better, grabbing mechanics are finicky and difficult, the movement system is similar to that of ECHO VR but harder to grab onto stuff (especially if you have a valve index kit)
its not perfect, but it was still able to outshine despite its flaws. it was a one time play, but i still enjoyed it from start to finish. 6/10 The game is not bad but could be better with some bug fix. 

I really liked the survival in a spaceship graveyard, especially in VR.

There is an ending but it will be chalenging so don't be made if you die because that will happen a lots especially near the end but it dosen't affect your spaceship and your progression if you put what you need in your storage.

Right now, not much to look at.  Poor game balance, some silly bugs, disorganized UI, but the developers seem to be passionate about making it great and it's worth $4 to support that effort.

 ‚ù§Ô∏è I got this game years ago, just to give it a try after a friend recommended the series, although I wasn't particularly hyped about it, and I ended up playing through all five games within a couple of weeks.

The Blackwell games still receive updates regularly, and each entry is better than the previous one. A truly remarkable labor of love.
 Juegazo. I like it - I'm into Point & Click games since the 80s and this one feels just like one of those. It's not a must-play but it's nice, the graphics are quite cute, the characters are well done, the voice acting is pretty decent (although some voices were a bit muted and sadly there was no way to turn the music down and the voices up or something like that - but there are subtitles) and the story is a good one even if it's a bit short. This game was great! A good little shirt game, some of the quests were a bit strange but for it's time I think it was pretty good, my only complaint is how loud the music is, it's insanely loud and running the experience Waay rough around the edges, but a great, moving story with likeable characters. Not a long game, not a particularly hard one either, but I am eager to continue the story. Fun point 'n click with engaging cases. Good 1st part in the series If you haven't played Unavowed, the 2018 game also by Wadjet Eye, go play that instead. It is more polished, with better writing, better sound, better puzzles, better graphics, better everything. It is set in the same universe in the same city in the same genre of story.

If you have played Unavowed and you would be happy with a much less polished game made by a much less experienced Wadjet Eye, then give the Blackwell series a try, starting here. Later installments get better slowly, ending up significantly below Unavowed but still quite nice. 

All in all, I enjoyed this game and the rest of the series. If you don't like this game, I don't think it's worth hanging on for the later installments. Years ago, I stumbled across this series by accident and I am SO happy I did. The Blackwell games are one of my absolute favorite game series ever and this first entry started it all.

The pacing may be a bit slow here but I love the look, love the amazing voice-acting, love the commentary and bloopers, and the story overall.

It's slow, it's difficult to figure out, and the autopilot buttons in VC are nearly impossible to manipulate with a mouse - I have to keep going back to the main panel and it's a chore. Not much fun.

Loading this aircraft in, it looked great and the cockpit looks nice, but some autopilot functions like speed hold and flying with autopilot full, but no heading mode just do not work. there are some glitches that need to be fixed in order for it to be a complete aircraft. Overall this needs some changes, and one of them is a price drop This is a great intro to jets for pilots looking to expand their hobby into more complex aircraft It took a video on youtube and some practice but once you understand this it is a fun jet! If there was a ""not sure"" button I would use it. Ngl, this plane is very good for how old the game is. Nearly every switch has a purpose, and it's not too cluttered. It even has  a full interior! However, this plane will whine at you. A lot. ""NO TAKEOFF. FLAPS. NO TAKEOFF. TRIM."" is its middle name.  Also, be ready to push forward on your joystick/yoke all the time when AP is not engaged. It generates way too much lift for its own good. But hey, this plane was built for the comfort for the rich passengers, not the pilot. And, of course because of that, it lands very stably, and heck would freeze over when this thing lands off center line. So yeah, I both recommend and not recommend this. I am glad comments have been made about the cockpit reflection issue. I am just learning about this plane and trying it out, and really like it, but I came within a inch of tossing it for the very reason of the unnecessary and distracting reflections that impair visibility. I found other folks upset about it, I think it is a major programming flaw. I did a lot of digging and finally found the following remedy that I am just trying out.

https://www.avsim.com/forums/topic/353403-feelthere-le-phenom-100-by-embraer/page/4/



- Exit FSX

- Rename reflection_cockpit.dds (SimObjects\Airplanes\feelThere Phenom 100\texture) to something like reflection_cockpit.old

- Copy/paste XGlass.dds in that same folder and name this copy reflection_cockpit.dds

- Start FSX

*************
If it works, and I suspect it will, it will make the difference for me being able to or not being able to use the plane.  I think we had an overly creative programmer here. . I hope this helps! Best regards, CEC

PS: It worked.

*******************************************
Later notes:

After working with this plane for a while, I have decided to abandon it for now.  Flight model seems off to me in some respects (sudden sinks in altitude and floats on approach that just don't seem realistic to me), jumpy screen and flight even in smooth conditions and it does seem much harder on frame rates that my modest computer can seem to hold up to.  I found an EPIC Victory small jet from an external site that fits my bill much better.  The Embraer jets definitely appeal to me (seems like a great company), and the smaller the better, but at this point this implementation seems to be more troublesome than need be on my end. The hassles with the screen reflections above also should have never taken place, and they show lack of rigorous evaluation on the programming side.  Better luck on your side, CEC",0.18485232067510546

668290,From Orbit,game,False,"27 Aug, 2019","Action, Indie, Strategy","From Orbit is a quick and light single player Action RTS. Guide your stranded crew home as they land on alien planets, scout out the area, build defenses, harvest valuable resources, and launch back into orbit before being overwhelmed by hostile aliens.","Boring Nice little game. Graphics look lovely and it's easy to get started.
The main issue with this game is that it feels incomplete. There just isn't much to do other than gathering a couple of resources. 
There are 3 biomes: desert, ice and jungle. The only difference between the three are the graphics. Gameplay and resources to be gathered are identical between all three.
Only two types of resources are to be gathered and all you can do with them is building turrets, gatherers and upgrades. This gets old very fast.
The game looks like a nice prototype which could have been the starting point of a great game. Unless substantial updates  come to the game, skip this one. This is a tough one.  This game seems to be an Early Access game even though it's not.  But it's definitely not complete.

It just lacks the depth I was expecting.  There's only 5 upgrade levels, across like 6 paths.  By the 4th-5th planet I had almost half the upgrades already.  I could see the difficulty was also going to spike.

The planets are basically all the same with a few monster generators that spawn every minute or so.   But this isn't a tower defense game.  Unlike in Gauntlet, you can't destroy these monster generators, and if you're not careful, they'll spawn when you're right next to them.

I really wanted to like this game as I loved Eufloria, Deep Rock Galactic.   I was hoping this game would really be a rougue lite rts, but alas it's not even that.    There's definitely a gem in there somewhere, but it needs some work.  If I had received this on sale, I probably wouldn't have minded as much, but at full price, the content is severely lacking.

I originally wanted to refund it, but just didn't have the heart to go through with it.. I did have some enjoyment for 2 hours, and I really hope the developer uses the money I spent on improving this game. A charming RTS (with a touch of tower defence) roguelite.  Basically the gameplay consists of - land on a planet, explore as quickly as possible to find resources to extract.  Periodically a wave of enemies comes to attack your ship.  Once you've extracted what you can/want, you head back to the ship to blast off, buy upgrades and select a new planet.  
Likes: The art syle and UI are nice, very clean. Music is good, but can see it getting a little repetitive. 
Dislikes: The steam store page gives more of gameplay guide than the game does.  Takes a little while to work out what you're supposed to be doing.  Would like to see the upgrade tree expanded, to give more variety on each playthrough.  Would also like to be able to change the keyboard shortcuts. Not a single word or hint about what the goal is or how to play! A really charming little.... rogueliteish rts sorta dealie.

 it's cheap for a reason TL;DR 6/10, If you are into a mix of emotionless sex, ahegao, and robot girl turning less robotic, you will find something here, but more than that, it is a really simple mindless game that will burn around 4 hours.

Break down of the overall gameplay loop: 7 days to save your waifu. 6 action point each day. 5 locations to interact with that increases ""Research"" points (Mini challenge every 25%). Minigames are to be replayed for unlocking special scenes. You can finish the game before day 7.

Design: 6/10

-The waifu's decent to look at.

-2D live-like animation to stimulate your eyes so you are not just staring a still png for 4 horus.

-CG art style is all over the place. Some are really good, but some you can clearly tell they ran out of budget to refine.

Gameplay: 5/10

-It is a mindless clicking game. Which has its pros and cons.

-The pros is that...well, it keeps the game short so all of us hentai enjoyer can just get to the sex CGs with enough engagment so we are not just spending $4 USD on a image pack.

-The cons...The varieties and simplicity of the challenges/mini games makes it tedious because:
1. The day-to-day action points are rechargeable through sex...which is a button with no limits, so yes, you can basically cheese everything by day 3. 
2. The 5 mini games help unlock special scene through points (Total is around 12,000, and each minigame give your around 500), so have fun playing the same or your favorite one over and over again just to grind enough to unlock. 
3. It is really hard to fail. The ""Find the pair"" minigame gave me 500-700 seconds to find a pair of 16. Why even give me the timer at all?

Writing: 6/10

-The story and the attitude of the MC brings up convos about robot/AI companion. It keeps me invested in the narrative. But don't be mistaken, it is not Detroit: Become Human, this is just a hentai game.

-The robot waifu become more human in the most generic, unnatural way. Like the archetype that she possesses or are going to possess feels like it is either going against what the story is suggesting, or it is copy and pasted onto her.

-The pacing in this game is all over the place that sometimes it becomes comedic, and other times it makes you go: ""Oh...That's how much time we are going to spend on this conversa...Nevermind?""

-Consistency in this story be damned. Because the writing started off not knowing where to go with the idea of ""AI girlfriend"", and it was getting somewhere, but by the end it kind of went back to the start, but now you saved your wife, I guess. Or did you? What? Also, you will never know what she know or doesn't know even though it is something a advanced AI should know.

Overall, this is a $4 USD hentai game with good-looking waifu. A fun VN with mini games and straightforward story. The MC has a unique perk that allows him to regenerate energy merely by c**ming! How's that! And yes, you can literally clear the game in Day One. (there is an achievement for this as well). 

The H scene is fully voiced, seiyuu is pretty good. Though the art can be improved slightly in my opinion but still doesn't break the momentum too much. There are minor translation error but not too painful to be nitpicked. Overall recommended for a quick and chilling game.

‚òê Text based
‚òê It is unbearable to look at it for a long time.
‚òê Bad
‚òë Not worthy of its kind, but acceptable.
‚òê Good
‚òê One of the best examples of its kind
‚òê It will make you forget reality.

Comment:
- The drawings and animations of the main characters are nice, but apart from that, there is nothing else.
- No matter how high the values are in the erotic painting, it does not affect the drawings and the character representation on the side.
- The fact that clothes are torn apart while fighting and enemies make erotic attacks is a nice addition. (except zombies.)

---{ Gameplay }---
‚òê Gameplay is not in the code of this game.
‚òê It is acceptable if you have a keyboard or mouse that will break.
‚òë If you have played the same genre of games, it is acceptable.
‚òê Playable, no new developments.
‚òê Being innovative may challenge you.
‚òê It's very easy if you accept the screen clutter.

Comment:
- In this game, unlike others, you can kill two types of enemies, one by touching and moving to the battlefield, the other by shooting fire from a distance.

---{ Audio }---
‚òê Turn off the sound, turn on winamp and play like that.
‚òê Bad
‚òë It's not too bad.
‚òê Good
‚òê Very good

‚òê Just press the button.
‚òë Easy
‚òê Easy to learn, hard to master.
‚òê For use in intelligence
‚òê Difficult, requires insufficient intelligence and skill.
‚òê Dark Souls

Comment:
- The game is really easy, they couldn't create a balance of enemies in the game. If you already progress by throwing fireballs, it's even easier, just level up enough in the last monsters. While the enemies give under 100 experience on the first map, around 500 on the second map. In the third quarter it is above 1000, and later on it is around 5000.

---{ Continuity (Grind) }---
‚òê He created it to sleep.
‚òë Necessary to progress.
‚òê Average.
‚òê The game is based on this.
‚òê A second life may be required for this.

Comment:
- There is no need to kill an enemy other than some items to buy, money for the hotel and level for the final creatures.

---{ Story }---
‚òê Is it a story, what is it?
‚òê There is a small footnote about the story.
‚òë Average
‚òê Good
‚òê Impressive
‚òê A world living within itself.

Comment:
- A story that started well and ended badly because it was left incomplete.
- As a priest, I earned my sins by killing enemies rather than by erotic events.
- The dresses do not serve anything other than the main quest, most of the characters with hearts on their heads just talk.
- It is unclear what titles you received.
- The events between the two nuns are never mentioned.
- Likewise, there are no different options but only one ending. and others are ""game over""
- few and unnecessary tasks. (Now I wonder, if I hadn't taken a swimsuit, how would it have passed while wading through the water? 8I )

---{ Duration }---
‚òê Tea Break duration (between 0-2 hours)
‚òë Short (between 2-10 hours)
‚òê Medium (between 10-30 hours)
‚òê Long (30-50 hours)
‚òê Lifetime

---{ Price }---
‚òê Free 8D
‚òë If it's on sale
‚òê If you have some extra money left
‚òê Not recommended
‚òê You can also throw your money out the window

---{ Errors }---
‚òê I didn't hear, I didn't see.
‚òë Minor bugs
‚òê Can be frustrating
‚òê It is certain that a patch will arrive soon.
‚òê Is this a terrarium?

Comment:
- Sometimes the z key does not fire on the map, or the x key does not work. I experienced it frequently on my second playthrough.

---{ Update (Plugin, Mods) }---
‚òê There is no update, the problems remain.
‚òë You need to update to play the real game.
‚òê Trying to solve its problems with updates. There is still a long way to go.
‚òê It improves itself with constant updates.
‚òê There is a good variety of modes.
‚òê There are enough add-ons for those with thick wallets.

Final Decision :
- If you find it for less than 1 dollar or for free, and if there are no other games left, get it.

NOTE:
- In the Graphics (Art) section, I decide based on the type of game and the game engine it uses.
- I'm not a game editor. That's why I won't rate it.
- Playing time may vary from person to person. I base it on the time I play.
- Not every error may occur on every computer.
- Continuity (Grind) may have different meanings depending on the game type. While action role-playing and similar games require constant continuity, open world and adventure games are only required to progress.
- I will not be writing for PC Requirements. If you are reading comments about the game, I think your system meets the requirements. This is not a game, this is 100% hentai 7/10.
ËøòË°å„ÄÇ I've been playing throughout the game's story and I've been encountering crashes whenever I get into a Cutscene or H - Scene. The story's great and all but the crashing was pretty annoying Well put together and about the time I was like, ""Okay, this is starting to get bad"", it was over. High quality art and uncensored.
Very good. its a fun game for what it is. Just make sure you SAVE!! lost almost 2 hours lol back to the grind Small details like adding live animations to character portraits really make this game standout",0.06213929258572111

It's simple, yes, but did brighten up my day. It's in pdf format, and you just flip through it. Was honestly just really happy to flip through and see all the wonderful memories from Cinderella Phenomenon. Getting to look at all the CG's with their quotes brought an uncontrollable smile to my face.

If anything, it's a great way to support the creators of such a wonderful game. They deserve it, wholeheartedly. <3 A wonderful addition to any fan of the series; this artbook allows you to see not only the images we loved in the story itself, but promotional artwork that make for amazing backgrounds and wallpapers. I mainly bought this as a show of support for the creators of the series, but beyond that, I genuinely enjoyed the contents.

As other reviews have mentioned, to access your art-book PDF file, go to your games library, right-click on Cinderella Phenomenon and select 'Properties.' From there, you'll want to click on 'Browse Local Files.' Your new collector's item should be in the folder that pops up! Enjoy! Bought this to show support for the original free game which I loved.  Thank you Dicesuki! Happy Goodness. Bought this DLC just to support the developer since the base game is free. Looking forward to other games from the same developer! (: I purchased this digital artbook in order to support the creators for their amazing VN Cinderella Phenomenon.  I'm looking forward to the second part Evermore. I will gladly purchase it!  I highly recommend purchasing this artbook in order to support Dicesuki for releasing CP for free.  Also, any DLC alternate endings would be awesome. Take my money!! :) Good: All the game art in one place. Its beautiful. Some promo work too :)

Missing: Anything other than finished game art. I would have enjoyed early designs, things that didn't make the cut, that kinda stuff. Bought this to show support for the game considering it was free and I quite enjoyed it. The digital artbook itself is such an eye candy, packed with character info and icons used throughout the game. I especially loved the short trivia part at the end and the promotional pics.

Recommending this artbook for those who enjoyed the game likewise and has some bucks to share. :) Seeing as how the game is free, I bought the artbook to support the creators in some fashion. I would have gladly paid more for the game itself, but this will have to do. The book itself is nice. There are some new pictures that weren't in the game, and overall the layout is nicely done.

[i]These are all reskins of exactly the same game![/i]  What value is there in this spam/pollution glutting the Steam store for gamers?

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics. 

This looks and feels like a mobile app, but it doesn't seem to have made it to the app stores.  It's unclear why this was put on Steam instead of the app stores it seems to have been designed for.  Maybe it was removed, maybe it was rejected by Apple and Google (they do have more rigorous quality standards than Valve does for Steam, after all).

Regardless, for all intents and purposes this might as well be a mobile app, it has the same limitations and dumbed down qualities.  It's impossible to recommend such a game to PC gamers.  We don't spend all this money building gaming rigs so we can pretend they're iPhones and play games that might as well be mobile apps.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 3 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

""Holiday Jigsaw Halloween 4"" has the farcical price of around $5 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam.",0.029422590292155514
829630,Skat Stammtisch,game,False,"30 Apr, 2018",Casual,With Skat Stammtisch you can enjoy a match of Skat on your PC whenever you feel like it!,"Skat, a game where you can play to lose and win by losing every play (Stich).

I have always liked playing Skat and I like playing this game.

There are some regional rules that have not been implemented (like Null-Ouvert, Revolution - Null Ouvert where the opponents can swap out cards, and Kontra-Reh-Bock-Jungfrau-Hirsch) The original Altenburger German Face of the cards is missing, and so some cards are unclear to me.
The comments of the AI players (and my own) become very annoying very quickly. I regreted paying for the game after the first game. (I played a lot of Skat in the past and really enjoy the game but this is not fun!) This game is a poor skat game, the AI is not fun to play as it never takes chances and only plays when it has only a 100% winning hand which takes away all the fun. You cant fast play a turn, there is no option for that, you can only give up, but it does not really matter as I wrote above AI only plays when it gets the 100% winning hand. Graphics are poor for a 2018 steam game. Game speed could be faster. Music is poor too. I regret spending money on it. Gutes Spiel.  Good card game. 10/10.",-0.03862612612612614
676030,Eternal Starlight VR,game,False,"17 Jun, 2021","Action, Simulation, Strategy","Activate your Neural Link to gain an omniscient view of the battlefield. Experience the conflict at any scale, as you plot the course that will lead your fleet to victory. Eternal Starlight is a tactical space combat game, built from the ground up for VR.","Really impressed so far. 

Reminds me a lot of BattleGroup VR. I would say there are some dialogs where because the audio doesn't work for all I'd remove them. The admiral for instance only says one thing, over, over, and over again. :(

Also I would like that I like the side missions, scanning, finding damaged ships, etc... Nice little filler. This game smacks Another example of butchering what makes a genre. This game gets both RTS and RogueLIKE/rogueLITE wrong. Story mode is honestly god awful. Same missions that are either a cakewalk, or a death sentence where no matter how hard you try, you will just get obliterated as all you are given is a capital ship with barely any combat capabilities and a single fighter that can barely provide any fire support, while you are fighting at least 4 ships each more than capable to destroy you alone. And there isn't an option to buy any other ships aside from more fighters taht are barely any help. After dying on one 'easy' mission 4 times i've explored other options, and those missions are straight up filler content. And out of 5-6 playthroughs i had the exact same content and the exact same outcome as the ""random"" prizes for said missions barely make any difference in your playthrough. 

Controls are pretty bad as well. My PC runs much heavier games with ease and when the entire game experiences microstrokes each time i try to use the voice commands it is irritating, not  to mention how awkward it is having to stare at my wrist and not at the action while giving commands is honestly bad and disruptive. 

From the positives i will say that the action looks smooth and it is nice to zoom in and out to see the action unfold. Too bad i am returning the game as it is more frustrating than enjoyable. Fun fleet strategy game. Took me until my third try to really start getting into it, but using voice commands certainly improved the experience. This is a great VR game, very enjoyable, great example of what is possible! Multiplayer/Co-op would be the next step but not sure if these are on the cards. Either way recommend 10/10

It reminded me a little of starfox back during the snes days when talking to the factions. Very good game! Awesome game! Similar to Battle Groups VR, if you‚Äôre familiar with that game. But without the ability to take the driver‚Äôs seat of your spaceship like you can in BGVR. I love how you control the space battles in both games.
I completed the campaign on the easy setting in about 6 hours. I kinda took my time, and enjoyed it. There‚Äôs three difficulty settings, easy, medium and hard. Most games I‚Äôve completed on one of the difficulty settings, I usually don‚Äôt go back and replay it on another difficulty setting. But this game I really like, and I‚Äôm gonna replay the campaign on medium next. There‚Äôs also a skirmish mode too, but I haven‚Äôt tried it yet.
I love this game, and I have no complaints. I would‚Äôve liked to have had the option to control the ships from the captain‚Äôs chair like in BGVR, but still a great game without the option. The graphics and sound are amazing. The gameplay is really fun, and I haven‚Äôt experienced any bugs, lagging, stuttering or freezing in the game. Everything runs super smooth for me. There‚Äôs several ships to unlock as you progress through the game. Also there‚Äôs plenty of weapons and armor attachments to unlock and purchase for your ships.
I highly recommend Eternal Starlight to anyone that likes space games. I‚Äôd give Eternal Starlight an easy 4/5‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è from what I‚Äôve played so far. And that rating could very possibly go higher as I play the other modes in game. Just finished the game under 4 hours on easy. Good game but short. Now will try Endless mode and some Skirmish mode.
Definitely recommended. Just wish for some dlc. Beautiful ships
Fun small scale combat
A lot of options when it comes to ships, hard-points, weapons and special powers
Beautiful environments

A crew of pirates led by Captain Jim embarks on a search for the Eternal Treasure.","While this fun little mobile game series is not bad, it is not worth your time in 2025. There are thousands of games better than this one on steam. 
Also it has annoying bug with text centered and going out of bounds on top and bottom which is just unforgivable. I was unimpressed with the Braveland, due to it being just a simple mobile port. A lot of reviews agreed. But the dev was responding to those reviews asking people to try Braveland Pirate, so I did. And while it is an improvement over the original Braveland, it's still just a better mobile game. Yet another entry in Braveland series, a collection of cheap mobile games mimicking Heroes of Might & Magic. While this game offers several improvements over previous games, it's still pretty dull and full of grind.

Everything that I said about previous games applies here as well:
* This game is made for mobile devices so it lacks many quality-of-life features of PC-oriented games.
* While there‚Äôs an attempt to make the world design more open by adding optional islands, it's still a simple point-and-click game, and the main path is linear. It still lacks open exploration and strategic depth of HoMM games.
* Battles are repetitive and get tedious and dull very quickly. Majority of the enemies you'll encounter are reused from previous games, and you'll encounter the same enemies over and over again.
* Player hero now directly participates in combat, but the talent system still feels uninspired. 
* The game is longer than its predecessors, but only because it relies on grind to pad out the limited content.

Ultimately, while Braveland Pirate adds some new features, it does very little to make the experience less tedious and shallow. A chill game Improved Braveland Wizards and a bit longer. Playing time is around 5-6 hours than previous games which took to finish in 3 hours Simple and straight forward time killer Game becomes impossible to play very quickly. Grossly unbalanced with no way around it to continue playing. Completely ends game play since you can not get past either of the two battles because it is unbalanced with no options to work with. Or try different tactics as you only have one heal and two players other than change the square you get beaten on there is no other tactics. You can't heal another player. you can't level up with lower battles. You can't go get different weapons. What happened to the people you hire? You have no other tools or ability to attack with range. You only have 2 swords and a single heal for the battle. Leaving you with your only option to choose which square you die on.  As a developer why do this? What do you gain from this? Is there a secret you are hiding from the player I couldn't find that opens up other tactics?  I couldn't find any. +
Fun.
Easy / Medium / Very Hard levels. [I'm getting to the age where playing on the easier levels.]
Funny story-line and cartoon characters, Nice music.
Choose your favourite crew types.  As the game goes on their strength grows, special abilities and dress in better clothing. Visit inns and get reinforcements. Maybe avoid really difficult bits and double back to them once more powerful.

My enjoyment:
8/10 Fun little game for your KB or HoMM fix. TL;DR: this game is the definitive Braveland experience and pretty simple fun at that. Get it on sale, play it, and forget about the first and second game.

This game, on its own, is fine fun. However, after playing through all 3 Braveland games, I've grown discontent with the series as a whole. Braveland is a frustratingly long trilogy for a series that almost never innovates on anything. The only thing innovated from the first game is the forgetful talent system in Wizard and Pirate.

Sure, the heroes and troops are different in each game, but not really... just stack troops and focus on doing as much damage as you can, GG. 

The only other difference is that each game is longer than the last.

By the end of this game, I was thoroughly exhausted with the formula and just wanted to be done with it, but only because I had 20+ hours of it already under my belt from playing through the first two games.",-0.013254329004329005

? Story (havent finished)
? Wrong font compared to store page screenshots? (tho in game one is better) 
? Actual worth for you (cus these are [b][i]MY[/i][/b] opinions) The game is fun and challenging, would love an update with more levels! A simple puzzle game about inverting and flipping gravity and your orientation.  The main game is short and is really more of a tutorial of how all the puzzle mechanics work. 

The real meat of the game is the side puzzles. Those are definitely more difficult. I have not cleared all the puzzles but I have clocked more than 3 hours just clearing the first bunch of side puzzles. 

Definitely a good game for a day off to complete. What a great retro experience! This game really captures the magic of the old Nintendo (Famicon) games: simple and engaging mechanichs, charming aesthetics, funny music and cute characters in pixel art.

The game offers a great experience for casual playing while having a drink or relaxing a bit before going to bed. The puzzles hit a sweetspot of difficulty, not to easy not to complicated, and if you like a bit more of a challange you have extra levels that demand a bit more of thinking besides the main route.

Overall, Invercity feels like the games I grew up with and made me fall in love with gaming, so give it a go. And If you happen to have little kids, this is a great game to share with them to introduce them to gaming, I know I would. Game Length: 4+ Hours (has bonus stages for more challenges as well)

With stunning graphics and immersive gameplay, brace yourself for a chilling adventure! Roll to victory in this winter realm!","This was a surprisingly decent sequel to the first AtmaSphere. I was pleased to see that the coins and vases were given a complete overhaul, with the vases actually breaking and providing more coins. The coins were even given a bit of a purpose, allowing you to spend them to change the skin of the sphere. I just wish there were an achievement for unlocking all the skins.

Other than that, the game is, at the time of writing this, poorly optimized and even crashes seemingly randomly. I posted about this in the discussions and the dev answered, which was a nice surprise. I made sure I was on the most recent Windows update, had the latest graphics drivers, and verified the game files, but still experienced a single crash before beating the game.

I would like to point out, which might be obvious given what I just said, but the dev does seem to be quite involved and active within the community, providing as much help as they can and whenever they can. I popped into their discord and noticed how active they were, which is quite refreshing! With that said, I think the issues I mentioned would be resolved given time.

+1 perfect games! Movement is really bad, it was fine in the first game I'm sorry but I can't recommend this one. I actually really enjoyed the first game and bought the 2nd as soon as I finished the first. 

But this game..... This game feels like the developer discovered Mario maker troll levels while developing it. The checkpoints make no sense at times, some of the jumps flat out abuse the inconsistent physics and rolling, and other jumps abuse the poor camera angle.

I fully cleared the first 3 categories but the ""insane"" category isn't hard in a git gud sense but more of a disrespecting my time sense. I put it down for now. 

The music also randomly stops in this one and it isn't relaxing or as enjoyable to play. Buy the first one instead. 

I'll keep plugging through the impossible levels and I'm sure I'll clear them all, but they just aren't fun or consistent. First AtmaSphere was nice and chill but this one is just frustrating and not fun at all. Refunded. Nice game 9/10 Harder than Dark Souls i liked the first game a bit more, probably because of the art style, but the new additions like statistics and leaderboards were really nice. If you want a small game that you can just turn your brain off, watch a podcast or something while playing, these games are great for that As the ball rolling game curator, I cannot recommend this.

We're looking at about 60 levels where you roll left to right, with limited 3d to move up and down.

Levels spread across 4 difficulties, and the only spike for me happened when hitting the hardest difficulty.  Dev chose to simply remove checkpoints in the harder difficulty, adding too much tedium.  Seeing myself as #3 in the global leaderboards for those last few levels - Not a good thing! Very atmospheric and beautiful game. The ball is controlled perfectly without any problems. The game is very well developed, thanks to the developers. Atmasphere 1 was a functional, if unexciting example in missed opportunities, that wile woefully unengaging to me, was at least somewhat functional as a work. Atmasphere 2 ramps up the presentation, and improves vastly upon the level design...but is broken on a fundamental level.

Even before diving into any of the actual stages, I found my controller to be completely non-working, and menus broken, with the options not letting me scroll to the off-box resolutions, only to have it completely imprison me on said screen, neither Esc, nor any controller button working.

Restarting, and actually diving into a level saw my keyboard thankfully working, however, the moment I let go of something, even with the left stick on my controller neutral, would see the ball rolling away from the camera. As well, the cursor was only usable on the menus if W was held, which caused things to scroll off the cursor, and thus you need to time it to get the option that was wanted.

Restarting [b]again[/b] with my controller off showed the same thing happening, and it was only when I physically unplugged said device, that ‚Äúnothing pressed‚Äù equalled ‚ÄúNo Movement‚Äù. Unfortunately, this was not the end of the issues, as the other issue I encountered continued to make the game unplayable.

Specifically, rather than accelerating to maximum speed smoothly, and facilitating any form of precise control, the ball ‚Äì contrary to what the gameplay footage in-trailer shows ‚Äì instead ‚ÄúSnaps‚Äù from minimal speed to maximum, complete with frame-rate hitch. Lowering this from 240 Hz to 120 in the options did make it semi-playable until Medium stage 4, but after the 16th death that could have been averted if this didn't occur, I lost all will and motivation to even try playing more of it.

I don't know if this was a by-product of ‚Äúunlimited FPS‚Äù being auto-selected, or something else, but in the instance the former option was the culprit, that said option is greyed out, making it unable to be toggled, and thus me check if that's at fault.

That's not it, though: the game never tells you double-jumping is possible, so unless you stumble upon it like I did, Medium 3 will be impossible. On the topic of that word, though, apparently a later stage exists that is literally impossible to clear unless you jump off the course, and wait for the platform to regenerate, then jump back on. This may sound innocuous, but in any other level, you die the moment you fall onto the background terrain, meaning the only way any player could possibly know to do this is if they either intentionally tried to lose a life out of frustration, or otherwise accidentally fell onto said part.

In other words, exceedingly poor design.

[quote][i]This game is scrubby.[/i][/quote]

It's a stupidly simple top-down shooter / meme game, made with Paint‚Ñ¢-style graphics.

It is also, perhaps surprisingly, fun for half an hour, the time it takes to kill enough blocks to get all the achievements.

There's nine weapons to wield and an upgrade system that lets you shoot faster and get auto-shooting guards. The enemies (big and small melee mobs, one shooter and one spawner) aren't challenging at all, even in large quantities. Still, it's entertaining watching the gold spew out of them as you kill them.

A couple of small qualms to note:
- You can't remap keys in-game (but you can in the Unity launcher)
- If you let lots of enemies to fill the screen and/or use spammy weapons like shotgun with maxed fire rate, the game may slow down.

Inexpensive as it is, get it on sale and have half an hour of internal chuckles and/or cringing to the fact this game exists.

840210,Arkham Horror: Mother's Embrace,game,False,"23 Mar, 2021","Adventure, RPG","Inspired by the award-winning board game franchise, Arkham Horror: Mother‚Äôs Embrace is an¬†investigation game served with turn-based combat, set in the cult universe of H.P. Lovecraft.","A great game. I wish there would be a sequel Not perfect but a great port! Let's make one thing clear. Arkham Horror: Mother's Embrace is not the digital version of the famous board game, nor was it much beloved card game.

Arkham Horror: Mother's Embrace is more in spirit with JRPG than TTRPG. Was the game good? No, it is not as good as it should have been, but it could be way worst than what we got.

What you love/hate about Arkham Horror is here. The colorful character roster, the Sanity check, the Mythos penalties and so on. The graphic is decent, the soundtrack is fine, and surprisingly, the dialogues are fully voiced.

So would i recommend Arkham Horror: Mother's Embrace? It's depend how much you love Arkham Horror as a franchise. If you do, yeah, go ahead. Not like there is other option. If not, you would not miss anything. This game sucks. The game won't let me change enemy targets, keeps forcing me to select the enemy the game wants me to select.  This game is a major fail. It's fun if you enjoy the source material. If you like the Arkham Horror Games (especially Mansions of Madness): Take a look, you might like this game! Otherwise: Don't bother, there are better options.

That being said: I liked it. Primarily because I like the Arkham Horror Franchise and its characters. '..snatched from the jaws of victory'.   The game not my playthrough.  I cannot in any way, unfortunately, recommend this game.  I have played through 6 of the chapters so far but gave up having twice not got through the final fight in no 6.  But that is not the reason I stopped.  It is all the annoyance created getting to that point.  Main issues - problems with movement, I have had to ctrl alt del to get out of the game numerous times because my character was stuck and unable to move as it was blocked in by the scenery or other characters.  Luckily when I rebooted it took me back to the same place but in a different position so I could carry on.  But is this acceptable?  Given the price of the game, is it really that unfinished.  Secondly, the sheer nauseating monotomy of clicking on every white dot mostly to find that you get a sanity check.  As others have said, you pick up a piece of paper that has today's date on it, oh no sanity check, lose one sanity.  that is not gameplay that is weak playtesting and only annoying to the people trying to play the game.  If you want to play the story ie get to the end, use one of the guides which say 'if you click on the shrine you will get a sanity check'.  You can then avoid them and the game actually flows better.

Alas this is not like the boardgame, there is no thrill of the chase or team bonding here, it feels like a cop-out.  To be fair I dont think it started out that way and there are lots of familiarities here with the original Arkham but  I feel that this would be much better done as an X-Com or Phantom Doctrine type background with Arkham layered over the top.  That way the movement would be excellent, you could have sanity and health for each character, you could have your base with team members working on other things while your team goes out to discover clues and battle the cults, and you could create the right atmosphere.  Lots of scenarios such as finding the other team members, investigating a suspicious event, battling a known cult hideout and eventually build up to the grand finale etc.

This game is a travesty I am surprised it even got a mixed grading.  I went for it because it was Arkham but wish I hadnt bothered. It is a nice touch. Not quite terrifying, but interesting, especially, if you like the tabletop games with the same characters. If you're a fan of the Fantasy Flight Arkham Files series of board games, you'll love this! The game play is reminescent of the old Sierra games. Limited text bases choices requiring you to do what the devs thought was the right answer. I find it clunky. In the late 1980's, it would have been acceptable tech. Not now. The Developer Lucky Hammers closed in 2019.",0.03660394265232975

Check the game here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFdIHizTxg I was too young to play the original hardcopy version back in the day.  Having said that, I thought this game was fine. The game isn't flashy, but neither is playing the tabletop version. The game is reminiscent of old text-based games of the early 80's, when computer graphics weren't really anything beyond what a Commodore 64 could offer. 

The game works as a single-player standalone, and it's a nice little jaunt for a quick adventure. On the PC it works, but like the tabletop game - it's not flashy. If you want a more engaging experience, buy No Man's Sky or something else. If you want an easy-to-digest experience that you can enjoy by yourself without spending hours doing the same pointless repetitive tasks - then Starship Traveller works, and it works well - and best of all, it costs less than the soda you're going to buy while waiting for your friends to show up at the gaming store to actually play Traveller on a tabletop. I love this book. Really captures the feel of the original Star Trek series! True to the original, there seems to be no link between the choice made and the outcome. Fun Definitely one of the better CYOA games out there. Love the story along with how interactive the game is (especially with using dice as well as being able to set skill, stamina, etc). I enjoyed finding all the pictures as well as experiencing all the different choices. The music was pretty decent, would've been great if there was voice acting but no biggie though. The art was also pretty decent Overall, if you like CYOA games, this one is for you. Not badly priced either, considering all the time I spent playing the game, it was definitely worth it. A great on-screen production of one of the early Fighting Fantasy gamebooks.
A change of direction from the usual sword&sorcery style games set in the world of Allansia, this one is set on board a spaceship [i](as if you hadn't guessed)[/i] which has been trapped in a parallel universe to Earth.
Steve Jackson's star-trek style original book has been brought back to life [i](beamed down?)[/i] on screen here. The gameplay is just as it woz [i](all those years ago!)[/i] and altho the original artwork has been redesigned with new, colour illustrations, it complements the game perfectly.
There are options for futuristic background music and sound effects, as well as a series of 20 Steam achievements ranging from tricky to amusing. There are also Steam trading cards for this game, if you like that sort of thing.
In addition to your own skill, stamina & luck scores, you have a small specialist crew with their own individual scores, who may need to fight with you or make skill roles in their area of expertise. Your starship has scores for weapons and shields.
As well as the standard FF combat, this game also has systems of combat for personal phaser duels (quick & deadly!) and ship-to ship battles. You have the option to custom name your character, crew, ship & even the ensign.
The game is not very combat heavy, but does need very specific path choices to find the info required to make your way safely back to Earth. The game is quite short, but that is because the original book woz only 340 references rather than the usual 400, so not a fault of the developers.
TinManGames have produced several of the original FF games as standalone titles (more about them elsewhere) and this is an enjoyable variation on the theme. Game rating

The translation is very effective, and fooled me into thinking that the native language of the game [i]was[/i] English -- though there are numerous typos that could be ironed out to give more of a professional gloss to things.  There are a few bugs, too, these all showing up toward the end, but nothing game -breaking, mostly just dialog flags resetting when you reload.  

Generally, I was impressed!  Will Professor Meme have further adventures, I wonder? Pleasant retro adventure for nice afternoon. Story is a bit hurried in the end, it tries to aim high, but has not enough space for it. So it could have been tad longer after all. Overall was an interesting and fairly short point and click adventure.  Playtime was about 2 1/2 hours without a guide.  The story is a scifi fantasy mystery where you play as Professor Meme after landing at the base on Zerulia.  Your friend Professor Gustav is missing and it becomes your job to find him and discover the mysteries of the strange creatures, the Seazogs.  The game is not without it's faults, and some puzzles are not as intuitive as I'd have liked.  There were two sections where I became stuck for a while.  For the first one, thankfully the base is fairly small so I was ultimately able to exhaust options to stumble on the answer.  The second however was thankfully not a game breaking bug, but was a softlock where I was unable to ride an elevator back up in a room.  I was able to quit to menu and when I continued, I was back in the starting room with all my inventory, so I was able to progress and ultimately finish the game.  I am considering typing up a guide so more people can ultimately finish the game, I feel that because there are times it is not clear on what to do, some people may be discouraged and not want to continue the game.  I hit that point previously, when I had originally purchased the game and gave up for a while. Only today I came back to try again and was able to complete it in one sitting, but I was also determined to see the end.  Again, I feel it was a neat game and very affordable for the short experience it provides, but it has faults and can be hard to know where to go next. Despite some technical glitches, I enjoyed this short sci-fi adventure.  The cute graphics might make you think it is a light story but it is actually kind of serious and dark in some places.  I got stuck a couple of times but nothing seemed too outrageous.  There is an issue with scenes resetting if you go back into another area and then return, also an object didn't appear in my inventory until I re-did a scene.  Still, I liked the character development and the setting.  you have to like retro-graphics obviously, and sci fi.  Beyond that some patience with the interface and this story can be quite rewarding.  I'm glad I bought this one, a fun evening well-spent. A very interesting retro style point and click adventure, would recommend always, even more if you feel like kind of nostalgic about those spectrum times, also nice little futuristic story to spend a couple of hours exploring this world. It's a nice game. 
It has a classic point & click gameplay, simple but very effective pixel perfect graphics, inmersive music and simple but effective sound effects.

1624970,Gnomes Solitaire,game,False,"20 Mar, 2022",Casual,Help the brave heroes overcome all the dangers and unravel the secrets of the kingdom!,"Disappointing solitaire game cashing in on the Gnomes Garden series.  It reuses the same backgrounds repeatedly (without any story context), has limited game design (it never evolves from the original setup) and worst of all very poor level design.  Some levels you have a pile of 40 cards to use to unearth 4 cards by revealing 12 (i.e. no challenge), others you have 15 cards to unearth 8 cards under 60 staged so that you only have 8 cards on display but have to remove 2 to get to 1 underneath (i.e basically impossible without using ridiculous numbers of jokers/shuffles).  These are randomly distributed so it doesn't feel like you are progressing but hitting walls.  I also have no idea how they are calculating their card packs as I've come across layers with 8 cards of the same number but the total card count was only just over 60. An aggravating play - there are far better solitaire games available. SImple and easy. A fun game to play Gnomes Solitaire is a basic mobile-app like solitaire puzzle game.  Solve various puzzle levels using Klondike style card moving and matching.

[i]These are all reskins of exactly the same game![/i]  What value is there in this spam/pollution glutting the Steam store for gamers?

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics. 

The game only displays in 4:3 pillarboxed aspect ratio (with some lazy ""wings"" to fill the pillar).  It's possible they developed this using an old CRT they found in a dumpster, or this game has been specifically designed for people gaming on PC's from 1995... either way, this isn't really acceptable in the modern era of PC gaming.

This looks and feels like a mobile app, but it doesn't seem to have made it to the app stores.  It's unclear why this was put on Steam instead of the app stores it seems to have been designed for.  Maybe it was removed, maybe it was rejected by Apple and Google (they do have more rigorous quality standards than Valve does for Steam, after all).

Regardless, for all intents and purposes Gnomes Solitaire might as well be a mobile app, it has the same limitations and dumbed down qualities.  It's impossible to recommend such a game to PC gamers.  We don't spend all this money building gaming rigs so we can pretend they're iPhones and play games that might as well be mobile apps.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 3 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

Gnomes Solitaire has the farcical price of around $5 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam.
 It's a fun game that's easy to pick up and play to pass the time. The gameplay is simple, but it is difficult to achieve the necessary scores due to the limited number of cards in the deck in certain levels. This forces you to replay levels more often, which can feel a bit repetitive at times.",-0.018098233003893377

Duke it out against other players in a soccer-like competition!,"Rocket League + VR sounds like an amazing combo, but all of my time was spent flying around waiting on people and they never came. Really unfortunate. ‚ÄòJetpack Stadium‚Äô has one big problem. Its not the graphics that are a little sparse, as they are also colourful and fun looking. It is not the amount of content because even at full price ¬£4.79 this COULD be worth many times that amount. And it most certainly isn‚Äôt the gameplay. The rockets feel responsive and while slow starting you can get the giant football moving at quite a speed because this game is essential Jetpack Football and I have an absolute blast playing it.

The problem is I played this game on my own with no AI, no other players and no-one showed up at all. There is no community of players waiting to play this and that is a shame. Without any single player options nor online players this game is dead before it got started and that is a big shame because this is overall a great game! While I marked it down for now there is MASSIVE potential here that I hope shows its face in future updates. Maybe a small single-player league or some tournaments, anything to counteract the lack of online players that makes this game feel like an empty shell waiting for something great to grow inside of it. where is everybody",0.037841710758377424

if there is a weapon on the outside. One of the CPU wrestlers will go outside the ring and then quickly get back inside. Then the other wrestler does the same thing - over and over - eventually it stops and they start wrestling again.
I like the arena/ring creation very similar to Fire Pro Wrestling World.
The create a wrestler edit add on requires more 3rd party tools than in game options. There are many options here but without paint.net or adobe photoshop or something like that. Wish they added template heads that you could modify.
Also you need to upload your arena and create a wrestler in order to use it in the game.
Lots of moves to choose from but no real CPU logic like in Fire Pro Wrestling World.
The game had potential - last update to it was in 2022....so not sure if they will ever add to it or improve it any longer.
I would avoid it - I was issued a refund. This game is total trash, super repetative and some of the worst tutorials as they dont work, i love this game 970 hrs and still counting cant get enough of the matching wrestling biggest names against each other and watching who would win oh did i mention it has both royal rumble and battle royal you can create the greatest rr or br       i would tell u but figure it out yourself I Kinda Do And Dont Recamond Seems like an unfinished game As is the actual wrestling in this game is pretty bare-bones with some animations looking clunky or too stiff. The real charm of the game therefor is not the gameplay itself unfortunately, but in the novelty of the custom content you can create or download. It's undeniably fun (for a little while) to play a wrestling match with a ninja turtle against the likes of batman or 1980's Hulk Hogan dropping the leg on Todd McFarlane's Spawn. Beyond that though, there just isn't much under the hood. You get exhibition matches and can create gauntlets which feels like a poor excuse for a career or season mode. Probably because it is. The game has potential, but it really needs a lot of love and care to make it last. Even little details like post-match celebrations and physical championship belts are missing. How hard is it to make a belt that can attach to a wrestler's hand during intros or play a cinematic camera celebration after a win?

All in all, if you're a fan of wrestling and crazy dream matches and you can find this on sale for less than five bucks? Sure, give it a go. This game is really good. would love for a few things to be added. That could make it better.
1) More over the top moves (like wwe allstars or battlegrounds) and more finishers twist of fate, styles clash, etc...
2)Taunts during the match. maybe a taunt button. the taunt selected from profile. (if there is a way already its not shown in the tutorial.)
3)The option to increase or decrease the game speed.
4)Last but not least custom music. a folder that you can put your music for this game. Then when picking a character you can pick the music from that folder to play for that character if that character wins.  and also in game music as well(during the match). would love to set up gauntlet with custom music..

I read negative reviews and unfortunately did not believed the game could be that bad, but I was wrong - what a steaming pile of early access this is:
- interface will take tons of work to make it usable,
- micromanagement based on points just makes the game tedious,
- there is no planning nor strategy elements,
- I can hear the same ""taking fire"" sample over and over again, but there is no indication which soldier is actually under fire,
- soldiers just die even when there is noone around to shoot them at this moment,
- shooting through the walls is quite common,
- shelling kills everyone in range, even if they had cover from the point of impact,
- I put guy with LMG next to the wall, so he could shood every enemy that will cross the gate... unfortunately he died without firing single bullet, because he was staring at the wall and I can't (or don't know how to) point him in right direction,
- interface often treats click on soldiers icons as selecting soldier that is close to the bottom of the screen, which in game depending on reflex actions is not a good sign,
- I gave guy machine gun, so, of course, he shot two friendlies that were in front of him

I could go on, but just like this game, it would be pointless Pretty good game, should add a beach invasion. That would be pretty sick
Really fun and kind of easy to play. +
Lovely graphics and visuals very charming

-
Badly executed game mechanics, heavy micromanagement needed, you have to look at all soldiers to refill ammo constantly and also to give medikits, there is quickseleections at the bottom for soldiers but you cant drop the medikit or ammo there.

Speed: The game is superfast, it could  have been a very tactical game if you could adjust the speed. Hopefully it will be added in a future release.

Annoying music that turns downthe atmosphere
--------------
Still I think it can be enjoyable to those people that like this highspeed game since the graphics are fun, if you are into shootem√∫ps  (even though I am I cant really say its enjoyable hehe) Not a bad game, has some potential, but I can't recommend it at the moment. Nie≈∫le I think this game has possibilities, but requires better unit AI or the ability to target enemies Tags: Tower Defense
Additional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library
Note: Early Access - Might be worth another look when it release

TLDR: Eternal Early Access. Wants to act like a freeform tower defense with relocatable towers. But comes across as a stif poorly designed and half broken RTS instead.

Outstanding Issues:
-Game does not obey conventional control schemes (e.g. no mousewheel for camera zoom, boxed selection not working) 
-Artificial Intelligence is poor. Only foes within a very specific radius will engage
-Game quickly becomes micromanagement hell as each unit has individual health and ammo bars that need to be catered to, along with unit repositioning and compensating for lack of AI
-Not a lot of strategy to adopt. Hard to use terrain and buildings as cover since they are mostly just boxed squares of unwalkable terrain with art placed on them, all thats left is bunching up dudes together near a bottleneck. Units dont really have experience, special abilities, dont radio or work as groups or adopt stances. Sigh.
-Incompetent/Revisionist historical slants

Pros:
+Good audio direction with the ambiant music
+The engine itself looks somewhat tablety, but half decent for what it is, offering some real resolution support
+The UI is not too overloaded and I feel like I could have experimented and learnt everything about it if the game was fun Pros -
- Great soundtracks.
- Easy controls.
- Great visuals.
- Replayability.
- Fun strategic challenges.
- Hard levels which make you have to get to know how the game works in order to win (even know the game is fairly straight forward)
- Very small learning curve, you can pretty much jump straight in and have a lot of fun.
- Oh and the most important thing of all... CHEAP.

My cons lean mostly towards configuration and development issues, l'm sure once the game has had some more patches these can be easily fixed.

Cons -
- Sometimes certain abilities wont work, eg replinishing your soliders ammo, half the time you will need to send him away from his squad/outside a bunker to heal or replenish ammo as the game has a hard time knowing what solider your're selecting when in close quaters with other units and either will use the ability on the wrong soldier or just wont do anything at all until you select the solider you want to use and send him away from other units so you can properly select him to use a ability etc.
- Sometimes enemys will shoot your soliders through walls/rocks and your troops cant fire back.
- General diffuculty/lack of consistency when controling large squads/individal units to move long distances across the map. (Will sometimes just unselect the units so you have to go back and move them small spaces at a time.)
- In it's current form the game only has 3 levels as far as l know which will take you a maximum of 30 minutes to 2hrs to complete.

I could go on about very minor fixable problems but l dont see the point, this game is SO much fun and 100% worth the money. Even if you can only get 1-2 hrs out of it in its current stage, (l hope developers will be adding more levels soon! :) ) it's totally worth buying to support the developers and the general replayabilty of the game.

The game is cheap cheap cheap and is one of those games you can play for an hour or two then go play your primary game like CSGO or pubg. Just one of those cheap mini games that is a tun of fun. l have a feeling a LOT more people will start hearing about this game as it gets developed because even in it's early stages l can see it has a lot of potensial.

-No level selection
-Keybinding for keyboard had no effect

As the game currently is, I can't recommend picking it up. It desperately needs a music soundtrack of some kind, and the game feels empty because of it. I want to like this game, I really do.

 Good picross with hidden object scenes and geometrical Tetris type puzzles.  The cursor should change between functions though (select/deselect tile) and the select/deselect buttons should be much larger to prevent redoing picross puzzles over. Combo of many different puzzle games. Interesting plot. Recommend. Same as the other Arizona Rose game...you like these types of puzzles, you'll like these. If not, you won't. Not much else to say about it.

The game-killer for me came when a pop-up ad interrupted my game, which leads to an automatic deletion when that happens, so be warned of that as well. This is the reason for the low play time, if anybody cares. Pretty Nice Puzzle Game. Without any discount a little bit expensieve but the developer made a good job to create an addiction puzzle fun factor. 
With achievements and trading cards to collect the prize is okay (Summer Sale Action)

Bei Puzzlespielen bin ich immer skeptisch. Meistens langweilt es mich nach 1 Stunde wenn sich kein guter Suchtfaktor einstellt (z.B. leicht erreichbare Errungenschaften oder leicht durchzuspielene Levels)
Bei dem Spiel ist es nicht so. Gute Sounduntermalung und schlampigkeitsfehler werden mit dem Nichterreichen der Errungenschaften (Fehlerfrei 0-1) bestraft.
Der Vollpreis ist etwas zu teuer angesetzt aber dennoch zahlt es sich aus. Die Entwickler haben keine M√ºhen gescheut das Spiel gut umzusetzten. :-) Pretty decent Picross clone, though the ""story"" is as bonkers as any old Hidden Object game.
Speaking of, there are a few HO scenes included here and there. Excellent picross with occasional minipuzzles of various types. Helpful touches like highlighting of the cursor's row and column, faded clue numbers for solved groups, disappearing clue numbers for solved rows and columns, and powerups. A bit more difficult than the previous Arizona Rose game; some puzzles are impossible to begin without guessing and risking a mistake, unless one uses a powerup. And if I recall correctly, it advances more quickly to the 20 by 20 board than the previous game does. Hint: Move the cursor while holding a mouse button to select multiple cells (shows selection count too!). While doing so you may click the other button to cancel the selection, so it's handy for counting cells. But be careful, a misclick can rapidly generate many mistakes!",0.12402482269503538

The puzzles are pretty well designed, easy but not stupidly so. Most importantly, the story is well composed, well presented, and generally well written. The constant fourth wall jokes are cringy and cheapen the otherwise good story, so that's really annoying. But otherwise, it's a good game with a good story, good storytelling, good art, and good voice acting. Intrigued for Episode Three. Honestly one of the best games and stories I've played in a while. It has everything I enjoy! good game 1 11/2 to 2 hours of gameplay, pretty solid gameplay with the occasional nonsensical puzzle being the only downside. All the good stuff from the first episode but now in a bigger stage. The voice acting is quite good and the pop culture references are very well done. On to chapter three! great game with intriguing story Bear with me is a story about a girl named Amber and her partner Teddy E Bear in the search for her missing brother, and the mystery behind the ""red"" man who has an interest in amber.

Art 10/10 - The art i found was very Beautiful. The Black and white design added towards the old detective theme that the gameplay was going for.

Gameplay 8/10 - The gameplay was a point and click puzzle game. While fun, it was still simple. The game also offered various options when proceedng through the game.

Story 10/10 - The stroy was very interesting. The whole game seems to revolve around amber acting out fantasies that a young child like her would. For the second episode, the game focuses more on Paper city itself Along with a a fresh batch of new characters and interactions.

Music/Sound 8/10 - The music and sound were very good. The voices of the characters were clear and and easily understood.

Overall - Overall i really enjoyed the Second episode. Finally venturing out into Paper city gave a great deal of depth to the story than the previous episode. The main characters Amber and ted share a weird kind of humor which i found refreshing. Much longer episode with even better jokes. What more we can want? Bigger, interesting city? More relations? New clues and threads? Hard choices? Everything included.

Ted? Come back... please. What a fun second chapter!  The ideas are just so well delivered, the jokes are on point, and this voice acting is 5 Stars good!   I just read about Chapter 3 coming, and I am excited to hear about it!  This is a game, and I look forward to more! Keeping it awesome and interesting :)",0.21641905901116426
1236190,Korpus: Buried over the Black Soil,game,False,"14 Feb, 2020","Action, Adventure","Korpus: Buried over the Black Soil is a first-person horror game in which you have been sent to evaluate an abandoned house, set somewhere in Eastern Europe. Uncover the houses past and the secrets buried within.","[h1]I know you are in my house.[/h1]
[i]Korpus: Buried over the Black Soil[/i] is a short but clever game, with a pertinent reminder about an event that has been neglected in western history. The game's main pull - that the house reshapes itself depending on the notes you've read - is sadly a little underexplored, given that notes are seen only in a linear fashion, so the game has zero replay value. The game also falls prey to that all-too-common horror game trope wherein the main protagonist can only run for five seconds before wheezing and slowing to a crawl. 

However, the way the house does reshape is very clever, the graphics and atmosphere are impeccable, there are some very, [i]very[/i] good spatial puzzles, the story is neat, and the game is a decent length for the price, provided you got it on sale. I think this game has been unfairly overlooked (probably due to the price), but it is worth a look. It is well made, even if some of the chase scenes are a bit lackluster (especially the last one, with an enemy who looks a combination of spooky and absolutely ridiculous). Very much worth it on sale, hopefully the developers (who seem to be from Ukraine) have another go at horror.

[b]Backlog Clear: #2[/b] It's decent, worthwhile on sale as it is quite short and full price is a bit much for what you get.  I like the art style, and the levels are well designed.  It's not terrifying, but it is unsettling, and draws attention to an atrocity that is little known in the west.  Although with that said, it's almost like two separate stories - the transition between those two stories was quite jarring.  But overall it's fine, and worth a look if it's on sale and you need a decent horror experience for an hour or two. A genuinely scary, and thought-provoking title. I was pleasantly surprised by this game and would definitely recommend it. During the first section I thought it would just be a horror game where you have to constantly run from the enemy, and not much past that. But I really enjoyed the story, I usually don't care about story when its presented in this way but this was actually cool. And the art direction/aesthetic was super cool too! An atmospheric setting and an rollercoaster story make for a fantastic short story with a few stumbles along the way.

Pros:

Story is great
Notes changing the layout is very cool
Music and sound is top notch
Lots of great visual spooks, think ""Layers of Fear"" without the questionable narm

Cons:

Iffy door physics can rip you out of the horror vibes, especially during tense moments
The ""Estate Agent"" set up doesn't really matter in the long run and the supernatural aspects are never really justified
The ""Threat Encounters"" vary from ""Fine, but rely too much on the wonk doors"" to ""Insufferable mazes with goofy gunman enemy"" 


Overall:

I usually don't score games, but If I had to I'd say 8/10. Great Story that gets hamstringed in the end by an awful final enemy section.

EDIT: I forgot to mention the main reason the ""Threat Encounters"" are a real pain in the arse, and that's because the player character has the stamina of a 75 year old smoker with severe COPD. look I actually like the story and don't mind the 1990s graphics but if you are going to make this a chasing game in some parts...make it easier to open doors and the shift button to run which hardly works....the guy can only run 2 inches from the last spot??? I finally gave up in the cellar after running for the second chase and only not making it because I couldn't get the door opened before he shot me...either make it easier to run or people will detest your game and never buy from you again....I would have recommended this if you change that. There were some moments where I felt like I didn't know where to go. But overall pretty good. There are some chase scenes but they weren't to difficult. is good suck cock Korpus: Over the Black Soil is a solid horror game, not relying on constant cheap jumpscares and going for a more athmospheric approach. The Ps1 era graphics are candy for the eyes. Piecing the story together around the house is a good way to make the environment change. However the gimmick of ""changing the environment around you"" by reading or looking at pictures is not so well implemented. When it's done with photos it's well done because you have to recognize the place represented. With text it's maube too direct. The mazes are short and not that difficult to manage and still keep a tense athmosphere.
I had a good time with the game for the hour and a half it lasted.",0.05395089285714285
506900,Downward: Enhanced Edition,game,False,"13 Jul, 2017","Adventure, Indie","Downward is a first-person open-world parkour based platform adventure set in the medieval ruins of a post-apocalyptic planet Earth. Make your way through breath-taking landscapes, face ancient guardians and unravel the deep mystery that lies behind the disappearance of humanity.","Its not a very good parkour game. Movement never gets to be consistent enough to fun. You will be constantly tripping over small rocks and ledges. As the game gets harder it becomes more apparent that the movement just isn't up to the task with it never quite feeling right. Fun little fantasy parkour game. Bought it a while back, came back recently for the Enhanced 2.0 update of the game, and it's been pretty nice. Easy to learn and difficult to master, straight-forward to beat the story but a lot of challenges outside of that. 

The story tries to be deep and dramatic, but it lacks a bit of punch. You can tell where things are going long before they actually get there, so it probably would've been more effective storytelling with either a different structure or with the presented structure tidied up a lot.

Combat could've had more variation and required required more timing, rather than the same handful of ""keep away from the attacks until the weak spot becomes clickable"" golems. But still okay outside of the drones that blow up in your face until you learn to backward-dodge away. Pretty fun for the 10 hours or so that it took me to beat it. Pretty cool game made for collecathon players. 
Some of movement kinda janky and need some getting used to This was the first game I decided to play after my father passed away. Honestly, I don't know what I was looking for... a distraction for my pain, maybe... leisure, perhaps?... or a sheer attempt to carry on with my regular life, and that includes keeping my gaming habit to bring me a smile or two. 
When I saw Downward in my Steam Library, I knew I had it for quite some time, among many others I couldn't find the right timing to sit down and play. 
Again, I don't know what I was looking for. I needed to have the sensation of flying, jumping, as if was trying to reach the sky or something. I needed to have a sample of what heaven was like, unlike the types of games I usually play. 
Well, getting down to business, Downward is a short entertaining game with fantasy and exploration aspects, but the main feature is the parkour. You boost for high jumps, touch the sky, fall, rebound, hook up, and all the rest. I mean, if you played and liked ""A Story About My Uncle"" this would be another nice option for you. I recommend this game, all in a nutshell. It brought me a bit of peace at least. 
 Good game, especially if you play it with UEVR. Played just a little so far and here are my observations.
- The Mark mechanic says you can use it as many times as you like, until after the first 'boss' then you only get 2 charges.. so that's a lie.
- I used the Mark to get behind the first boss but it instant turns 180 degrees making the mechanic completely useless with anything that can turn to face you.
- The upgrades screen doesn't explain what anything is except health, so you're upgrading whatever?
- Much of the items in the upgrade menu are in Spanish.
- The wall mechanic says how to wall-run and jump off, but then the next 2 wall sections have a bouncing auto-jump added to them.
- Much of the items in the upgrade menu are in Spanish.
- There's a climb animation but no animation for picking up, using a lever or drinking.
- Falling (dying) doesn't cost anything, until it suddenly does.
- There's an invisible 'killbox' when you fall too far, except in areas where there isn't.

With all things considered within the first few minutes of gameplay, I still recommend it for the platforming and world detail. It's an ok game. Climbing mechanics are heavily scripted, and sometimes the same jump cannot be done with the same height at a differenet place. The fighting is totally pointless, just as the upgrade system. The gathering is suppose to encourage running around looking at alternative routes and secrets, but the game is so boring, it just kills the vibe. The only real fun part is the ending after the cast. The story is also insanely dumb.

At least it has tits...but that's pretty much it. There are many other much better fps platformer games out there. Downward: Enhanced Edition has beautiful graphics of a post-apocalyptic Earth. That's the only real positive. The gameplay is just boring. The graphics almost make up for the lackluster rest of the game. It's a parkour walking sim, with little else to do since there is little to no story. 5/10 MEH 12 hours across two playthroughs, deserves an expansive sequel This game is junk.  

There is no ability to rebind any of your controls.

Not joking.

Tough luck if you have any mobility related disability.

If you want to buy console trash for your PC then maybe you will love it?

EDIT: the keybind thing is fixed now if you want to play this game.

Shmups Skill Test is a clever way to evaluate your shmup skills in the form of a &quot;gamer age&quot;. Challenge and unlock shoot-‚Äôem-up-based minigames in a gauntlet of shmup nostalgia goodness.,"It is full of cheaters except for the can game This is a surprisingly addictive shmup that will more than likely hold your attention for a few nights if you're interested in the ""Brain Age"" angle. 

My first major complaint is no actual tate/portrait mode support. You CAN rotate the display, but it has no actual vertical monitor support, so people with a secondary monitor for tate gaming are out of luck. Who rotates their main monitor without changing from landscape to portrait just to play a game in that awkward way anymore? Really wish there were portrait mode resolutions supported.

There were 2 minigames I didn't like that I wanted to bring attention to (I don't know the names so bear with my descriptions while I wing it):
-Dodge Everything! This one shoots out a very predictable checkerboard pattern shot, vertical then horizontal. This one will either be a very easy one that you get without trying 19 times out of 20 for an easy 10,000pts, or a frustrating miss where you can't predict the horizontal shot depending on your skill level. As someone who falls in the former category, I say this minigame is a total detriment and it's removal would only make Shmups Skill Test slightly better.
-Grab the scores! This one consists of trying to grab 10,000pts worth of 100/1,000 skill bars flying off the screen within 10 seconds. This one will be frustrating until you realize the top of the screen is much easier to grab the points... then after you find that out, it still feels a bit too random when it pops up as far as being an indicator of your ""game age"".

Both of these minigames are a bit annoying if you think they're being considered hard into the ranking. That said, when trying to figure out the names of these minigames for the review, I looked in the practice section to see what they were called and couldn't find them. I took that as an indicator of these games having less of an impact on your actual ranking and more as just a ""street fighter smash the car"" bonus stage. Wish there was more of an indication to show this, as these are the main games that really take you out of the whole ""game age"" ranking system.

All that said, I enjoy the brain age gimmick and thought it was done pretty well. I can absolutely recommend this game for a few nights of fun shmup fun when you just want to jump into some shmup minigames, or if you want a nice warmup before diving into your next 1cc attempt at your shmup of choice.

P.S. In response to top negative review: this isn't a bait title. It's Shmup SKILL TEST, not Shmup TRAINER. That's like being mad at the SAT's for not helping you git gud at math :p kino I kind of feel like I was tricked in getting this.  Shmups Skill Test is definitely a bait title for a game.  

Shmups Skill Test consists of a number of mini games all involving shoot 'em up game play.  You play these mini games, get graded on your performance, and at the end, are given your 'shmup age'.  With younger meaning you're a better shmup player.  Though, I don't know if this is a simple ranking system or does something interesting when you start to get to children ages.  I couldn't get below 40 years.

Additionally, it also offers a breakdown of how well you did the mini games compared to other players.  Which I found a little more interesting, but I also don't know what sort of pool of players I'm being compared to, either.  I mean, I know I'm not very good a shmups... I've played them and my progress, or lack there of let's me know all too well.

Where I think this game could have been good, is if it aided in developing a player's shmup skills.  Something like Gunvein's tutorial.  But without something like that, Radiant Silversword's Cardinal Sins game mode does a much better job of testing a player's shmup skills with a better presentation.  And Radiant Silversword comes with an actual game (Radiant Silversword).  Even SophStar has cadet training section that offers a better set of mini game challenges than the entirety of this game., and it also comes with a really good game.

Ultimately, Shmups Skill Test had a chance of being an interesting name.  But not nearly enough content nor anything to help a player get better at shmups over just playing actual shmups.  And there's a number of them here on Steam for the same or less money that are better than this. It's time to level up! I don't expect it like warioware hahaha.It's so fun, i really enjoy it. Worth to buy if you like shmups game

Give it a go, see how good you truly are at shoot-em-ups. Estoy viejo I'm no stranger to shmups, having clocked in lots of game time in DariusBurst Chronicle Saviours alone. From long running franchises to smaller titles in the genre, there isn't a shmup title I haven't played on Steam. After discovering Triangle Service's shmups, I decided to give one of them a whirl. And what better way to start with their legacy than Shmups Skill Test. Having clocked in at least seven hours of play, how well does it fare compared to the rest of Steam's shmups?

[h1] The Good: [/h1]

+ The replay value of this game is practically bottomless. No two runs are ever alike, as the minigames in a main run change. One minute you're blasting tanks, the next you're collecting medals. If you're lucky, you might have a 'classic' shmup homage level. And on top of that, the minigames you accomplish can be played individually. There's also leaderboards and a replay function, to archive your efforts and compare yourself to other players.

+ Shmups Skill Test is newbie friendly. No nightmarishly hard difficulty to be had here, as the only minimum challenge is memorizing the minigames and trying to get through the game with a good rating and score.

+ Shmups Skill Test also has multiplayer. Four player multiplayer, no less, like on DariusBurst Chronicle Saviors.

+ The music is good, too. It fits the many minigames present, given how some of them are frantic and borderline non-stop.

[h1] The Bad: [/h1]

- I'm getting this out of the way: Shmups Skill Test only has built-in autofire for limited minigames. Everything else is classic button mashing. This is problematic because some of the top scorers and players have controllers with autofire. Hope you have a controller with turbo, or an external program with turbo function.

- Some of the achievements are easy to understand, while others are archaic and complex. For one thing, there's an achievement where you leave the game, wait a week or so, then come back to the game. Another one has a rare 'quiz' minigame that has to pop up; I haven't gotten that in the many playthroughs of Shmups Skill Test.

- The game doesn't record your age result at the end of a replay. A minor gripe, but still.

Overall, do I recommend this game? Yes. Shmups Skill Test will provide a lot of playtime and longevity, and it doesn't require anyone to be extremely skilled at it to play.

I especially love the new Batman ones. Not sure about stats (TBH the Superman car is my favourite for racing anyway) but they look awesome. I think the Robin car is my favourite aesthetically. 

All in all I think you get some great bits and pieces from this DLC pack, and if you don't want everything from it, you can simply buy the pieces you do want separately. 

The fact they gave us the option to either buy as a pack or just buy the bits we want is great. I personally bought the paqck up front to support the game, and also so I didn't have to worry about remembering to buy stuff as it came out. 

This way I already have everything when it drops. This is a game I bought, knowing I wasn't going to be playing it much until 2022, when I have people over. By being able to buy the all the DLC ahead of time, it was one less thing to worry about. 

If you want a care free way to acquire all the DLC from 2021 ahead of time, you have the option.

If they do a pack that has all of 2022's DLC as well, I'll buy that as well. 

I only wish I knew about the racing season earlier, as I fear it's too late to unlock everything now. If they had an option t just buy the season cars for a higher price, I'd do that. I don't really have the time currently to invest into a racing season, and as I missed the start of it it's likely I'd never be able to unlock everything. 

I think maybe if they has seasons on rotation, so you can have another go at unlocking everything at a later date, this would be nice. 

Or maybe even have seasons ongoing and overlapping. So once you pay for it, you do not have a time limit to unlock everything. I know timed seasons are an ""in"" thing with the kids today, but I really would have liked the ability to unlock things from pass at my own pace. The main reason I didn't buy the pass (despite being very cheap) was because I don't like feeling rushed. 

It's a shame I'm going to miss out on those DC villain cars, but like I say I hope they actually give us another shot at them next year. 

 Everything in the pass is out now, so my final opinion is its pretty good! Probably not worth the price but if it goes on sale and you're interested in everything I would say go for it, its a big bundle with pretty much every DLC released as of now (aside from like, the preorder stuff that became DLCs).
The Batman expansion even comes with extra City Rumble levels which is quite nice! Surprising it's not really advertised. Because I purchased this pass earlier I got the Batman Expansion today in addition to lots of other cool stuff along the way; awesome! I love this game  Hot Wheels Unleashed it's one of the funnest games I have played i years! So many different cars to collect and things to create and customise too : D Not worth the price. One of many cash grabs by Milestone. Can somebody explain the point of this pass? I bought 2 season passes for this game but the devs keep putting out DLC that is not included in either of them?????

But the controls are HORRIBLE !! and not rebindable.
I want to love this game, but I hate it. Controller or mouse and keyboard, it is a pain in the bum. I hope they make a sequel someday... the pixel art is soo good also music is awesome.. Spiderman roguelike, just need to get use to it. Very solid fun and challenging game with great music and art! cool I tried for 10 mins trying to get use to the controls but I could not..... 
The mouse movement being tied to player just throws me from any rapid form of precise movement I want, I looked for options because nothing in control scheme.

and found a post from developer.

""Hi all! We've tried all different ways to do this, and locking the cursor around the hero was the only good way to do this with our mechanics.
Unlocking the mouse made it impossible to zip around a level quickly, as you would need to do large, uncomfortable movements to follow the hero on the screen - I know it sounds a bit weird as it is unconventional, but trust us, it wasn't feeling good at all! The way we did it takes just a little bit to get used to, I hope you will enjoy it :)

Thanks for your comments! <3""

SO I can't play the game.

Update, Found old launch with option that gave more mouse controls made me sad they didn't work. Not enough variety. 
Dull.
 Wait for it to go on sale, and you won't regret picking it up. hook hook, blam blam, awesome game! FLINTHOOK is a rock-solid, 2d rogue-like grapple-shooter ... thing. 
It has very clever game design, art direction-- practically the whole nine yards. 
Fun to hop in for 30 min to an hour and blast away. 

*controversial point* - some people probably think that because the enemies have 
very distinct patterns, they're pushovers. Others will call out the presence of 'too many
gimmicks' among enemies and obstacles. I land somewhere in the middle. There are going 
to be some cheap deaths, and pushover moments - that 's the nature of the randomized
beast. These points don't cause me to dislike the game. 

THIS IS WHAT RAISES MY IRE:
It takes often an entire half hour JUST TO GET TO A BOSS. They're the typical, room-sized variety,
And there's no way to grind for strategies. You just have to get good and watch vids if 
you're struggling. That doesn't have to be! 

I would suggest implementing a wager mode for boss encounters. Say you knock out a weekly challenge. 
GREAT. you've got 500 coin. Head on over to Boss challenge section, and challenge a boss you've already encountered, for more cash, or to grind for strats. That way, you have a better shot of making the gauntlet and beating the boss for real. Everything else about the game can be reasoned away. It just needs a boss mode. 

8. 4  out of  1O stars Definitely play Rogue Legacy 2 instead.  That game is harder to beat, but it's so easy to ""read the room"" in that game whenever you enter a room that you can race forward without ever stopping.  Dead Cells is the same way.  Meanwhile with Flinthook, the traps REALLY blend into the environment, so you're going to be punished if you don't stop for a few seconds and locate all the hazards everytime you enter a new room, which really ruins your momentum.  It's still beatable, and there's guaranteed healing items in every run, but it's not as fun as it could be.",0.11859941249226963

In this game, we will follow the life of an engineering student who must pass his English exam in order to be allowed to participate in the next tournament. In order to improve his skills, he decides to take lessons and meets a girl who will help him...

At the beginning, I didn't read the summary of the game so I didn't understand anything, I didn't understand where the developer was coming from but in fact, it's just the daily life of a student who tries to improve his skills. The story is a bit dramatic through the 2 bad/good endings but in the end they still say something similar.

In the overall criteria, the game is okay but it deals with the fact that those who have difficulties but still try to develop will be the ones who will have a better chance to improve if a failure follows and that's why they will say : [i]""those who work hard and fail, should have more courage to face failure""[/i].

I didn't really enjoy this game because it was a bit boring, so even though the game is practically free, I don't think I can recommend it.

[i]In each game, the developer tries to deal with an aspect of life, so you should try them.[/i]

Leaflet Love Story is a Visual Novel developed by G+ Gongcheng Tuan company, released in 2019 on Steam, recently they released the English translation for all people to enjoy. This game attracted my curiosity by its price but also by the image of the game. If you like romantic stories with a dramatic twist and set in college, this game might appeal to you.

[h1][u]Criteria[/u][/h1]

[b][u]Graphics/Design[/u][/b]

‚òê Photorealism
‚òê Beautiful
‚òê Good
‚òë Decent
‚òê Bad
‚òê Don't look too closely
‚òê Paint.exe

I have played very few Chinese VN, we feel that there is something different in what it produces compared to Japanese VN, for my taste, the background and the chara-design of the characters are well drawn, it is not incredible but we manage to enjoy the game and follow the story without being bothered by the quality of the drawings.


[b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b]

‚òê Very good
‚òê Good
‚òê Correct
‚òê Looking at the walls is more interesting
‚òë None

In a VN, there is no gameplay to speak of other than clicking. We can still talk about the navigation in the menus, the options offered during the course of the story that are perfectly suited.


[b][u]Audio[/u][/b]

‚òê Maestro
‚òê Very good
‚òë Good
‚òê Not so bad
‚òê Bad
‚òê RIP my ears

I am a little disappointed that there is no opening in the game, the OST are correct, when we get to sad moments, the music played its role well. You can feel the emotion through the sound.

[b][u]Audience[/u][/b]

‚òë Children
‚òë Teenagers
‚òê Adults

The game contains a romantic story, which can be suitable for children and also for teenagers who want to discover what a feeling of love can be.


[b][u]PC configuration[/u][/b]

‚òê Very low config
‚òë Low-end PC / entry-level mid-range
‚òê Mid-range PC / entry-level high-end
‚òê High end PC
‚òê NASA PC

The game is not greedy at all, an entry-level PC will do very well, you can enjoy this game on your grandmother's PC! :)


[b][u]Story[/u][/b]

‚òê Story?
‚òê Text and audio floating in space...
‚òê Moderately interesting
‚òë Good
‚òê Captivating
‚òê Will replace your life

Leaflet Love Story tells the story of an engineering student who is gifted in robotics, but unfortunately he is bad in English, which prevents him from studying abroad. So he decides to enroll in English classes and meets a pretty girl with whom he gets along well. From this moment on, we will be interested in the daily life of these two young students.

What I liked a lot in this story is the dramatic side, a love relationship does not always end as we want. Fate can take over. The game offers road choices that will determine whether the story will be a happy ending or an unhappy one. After finishing the game, I can tell you that you will have 2 happy endings and 2 bad endings. It is interesting to do them all to see how the story will play out. 


[b][u]Duration[/u][/b]

‚òê One cup of coffee (<5h)
‚òë Short (5-10h)
‚òê Medium (10h-50h)
‚òê Long (50h-150h)
‚òê To infinity and beyond!

This will depend on the player's investment and reading speed, in my case I spent quite a bit of time trying to understand every element of the story in detail, plus I don't read fast so it took me about 5 hours to finish the game. Looking at the other reviews, most people finished it in around 4 hours.


[b][u]Price[/u][/b]

‚òë Free!
‚òë Good value for money
‚òë Wait for a discount
‚òê Not recommended

The price is really affordable for the duration of the game, I still advise you to wait for a promo, for less than a euro, it's really a very good deal! 


[b][u]Translation[/u][/b]

‚òê Not translated *not yet*
‚òê Disappointing
‚òê Quite a few mistakes
‚òë Nickel
‚òê Translated into all languages

The game offers translation in Chinese and in English, if you are proficient in any of these languages, it's perfect.


[b][u]Bugs[/u][/b]

‚òë Never heard of it
‚òê Minor
‚òê Frustrating
‚òê So many bugs, impossible to play

No bugs at all, runs great!!!


[h1][u]Conclusion[/u][/h1]

What I really liked about this game is the choice of routes that can vary the storyline. The story is good and can suit everyone if you are not demanding, but that's all. I still recommend it because of the price of the game, you don't risk anything with the amount you will pay. Add it to your game catalog or wishlist for promo! :) Average story with some weird ass endings and terrible translation. The art is really cute tho. bad translate 5/10 [h1]Qin Jingxue is an angel![/h1]

Gamebreaking:

* *BALANCE* wave scaling is a mess (especially if Dinosaur bug mentioned above is actually a feature)

Level 67 was tricky for me until I noticed a key detail.
The rest were pretty short taking a few minutes or less to solve.  Bear in mind the amount of content is small and don't expect a lengthy challenge.  That being said, all can be solved by logic, which is nice.  The backgrounds change when you restart a level, which is subtle but gives some variety.  Nicely made puzzle experience.

Help her by searching for and trading all sorts of items to various humans and youkai to get enough food to make her lunch a rich one!","Do you love Hina? I love Hina. You should buy this game so you can love Hina even more. If you don't buy this game then I guess you don't love Hina, in which case, you should love Hina and buy the game. I mean come on, it's Hina. who couldn't love Hina for crying out loud. I mean she's Hina. Just look at her spinning and sucking up all the misfortune. What's not to love? Spin Hina Spin! I love Hina. Do you love Hina? Very cute Hina game! I do not regret buying. All Hina fans should buy this game. 
It's basically the myth about the guy who buys a house with a pin through procedural trading but its Hina getting lunch
you will play as hina a lot and it's cool and hina is cool buy this game Sanae stole a dirty magazine from me 
dude. its called ""millionaire lunch"" but hina never acquires an inventory worth more than like $400 so this is clickbait A simple but incredibly fun game, Hina-chan's Big Trade is a great thing to sit down with for an hour or two. With quick playthroughs and snappy comic dialogue, it's fantastic for scratching a puzzle itch when you only have a bit of time. The large variety of trade items makes it fun to replay and try to plot more effective trade paths to improve your outcome. Unfortunately, a lot of playthroughs will feel very same-y and you'll find yourself running through all available dialogue with the small number of characters in the game fairly quickly without new items to trade. It's also a very fangame-y fangame, relying on a player's prior knowledge of characters to hang its humor. Overall I think it's a worthwhile thing for puzzle loving Touhou fans and I've had a lot of fun with it. Cute Hina, tbh the replayable really fun! so many ending and content! Hina has always been my favorite if not one of my favorite girls ever since I first saw her sprite in Touhou mountain of faith and hear her stage music. While her ability is to absorb the misfortune of humans, she is also hiding deep inside a forest that is located under a mountain that is full of youkai, chasing away any human that has mistakenly entered the dangerous realm of youkai and making sure they leave safely. To prevent the absorbed misfortune from going back to humanity, Hina let these dark matters surround her, then distance herself from humanity. People don't know this, they only know they have to avoid her at all costs as the consequences of getting too close to her misfortune can be death, therefore treating her like a plague. They never appreciate what she did, they never try to make a statue, offering or be thankful to this goddess who has been protecting them for the entire time. They only escape when they see her, believing she is the reason why misfortune exists in and fall on them. Even though Hina is taking all the blame, she doesn't hate humanity for this, conversely, she loves humans a lot. She may act dismissive when she saw a human. She does that because she knows she is objectively too dangerous to stay close with, and so she acts uninterested, but deep down in her heart, she likes humans, she just wants these humans to live a safe and intact life and perhaps she wants to know more about human.
Hina is so nice that she never intentionally be hostile to any human beings, she is so forgiving that she never pulls a long face at people who treat her as an enemy or apocalypse. She is so innocent that she thought if she dresses up like a Christmas gift, people will understand she is in fact friendly. Even Nitori considered she is too gentle as an apotropaic god and stated that she won't get angry under any circumstances in the M-1 Grand Prix.
You see, Shion may also be a misfortune god, but Hina is the one who has the thinking of benefiting everyone else regardless of how harsh she is treating herself, and executes it in the best way to anyone possible, except herself. Did she ever reveal how sad, and pitiful she is after all these works and only to get hated on? Hina is THE TRUE SECRET ANGEL that no one admires.
Hina is so underappreciated as a protective goddess, Her ancestry has made up for the best ability material, the best religious material, and the absolute best waifu material. How can you not love, receive any affection from or return your feeling to a person that is willing to give up all she has, and not have a complaint, JUST FOR YOU? One thing is for sure, there won't be a person treating a relationship as serious, as sincere, and as cherishing as Hina does, cause she treats humans with genuine. Unfortunately, people still only acknowledge or referring her as ""SPIN"" or ""hinacopter"", they always think she spins for fun, overlooking the fact that this girl has one of the biggest contrast between personality and ability and how she is able to make use of it to help people out.
Hina, she maybe the incarnation of darkness, depression, and danger for most people, but she will always be the brightest, warmest and most beautiful guardian goddess for me. Translator is a filthy hypocrite who doesn't consider his actions for half a second if it could give him a bit of extra profit.
Too bad since the game itself is pretty fun, look into a way of getting an untranslated version of the game if you want to support the dev. Kagiyama nearly dies from reimu :(
Joon has a giant loaf of bread :) Much better than the other ISY game on Steam.

430410,Memoranda,game,False,"25 Jan, 2017","Adventure, Indie",Memoranda is a 2D point and click adventure game inspired by author Haruki Murakami‚Äôs surreal short stories.The game tells the story of a young lady who gradually realizes that she is forgetting her own name. But is she really losing her memory?,"It's a careful ""yes"" or ""maybe"" from me. I liked Memoranda's art style, voice acting and many other artistic or impressionist aspects, but found the gameplay and its puzzles very illogical and un-intuitive, so I resorted to a guide pretty much the whole way through and just tried to enjoy the story.  Not the best kind of Point n' Click game, but not the worst either. Looks good but ultimately felt kind of hollow, with the kind of puzzles that make people hate adventure games. How much Murakami do I need to read to enjoy this game? I'd like to leave a ""neutral"" review. Nice art and atmosphere. Puzzles aren't that interesting or necessarily very logical. Quite quickly you turn to the ""trying everything with everything"", why else would someone ingest petrol? There's still some bugs that aren't so nice. World changing is arbitrary at times. Sometimes you give the correct solution but the game doesn't accept it because you need to have triggered the solution by interacting with specific things. Sometimes you give a partial correct solution by selecting the right item before combining it and the game tells you you're flat out wrong without hinting you're partially there. I found the ending a bit underwhelming, not great if you like deducing information, because the logic is either a bit loopy or the small puzzles are exceedingly simple. Also why can't I give back the elephant picture or tell the lady where her cat is :( some closure is missing. 5/10 (closer to a 6 than a 4). Yes. Nicely drawn and vocalized, but completely aimless adventure where nothing makes sense, no item interaction, no dialog, nothing, also unpolished in certain areas, opera singer is one nice example where you have to mute your speaker just to get over with meaningless dialog and interaction.

Bad execution with nice artists and strapped ""based on"" label to try to get extra sales.

On top puzzles are completely uninteresting and most can only be solved with a walktrough, with zero inspiration as well.

Overall 0/5. No amount of ""pretty pictures"" can help it rise below basic Point and Click genre parameters.

Any point and click adventure enthusiast should stay away from this trap. After encountering the first puzzle in ""Memoranda"", I was excited: finally, a game with built-in hints! But that probably was the last nice thought I had about the game. I got stuck in the main story line so many times, there are no useful hints for it. For example, I picked up flour from the bakery and the character thought that she can finally bake doughnuts for the little girl. Okay, good, I know what to do! But there is no kitchen or any other place suitable for that. What I forgot during my long break from playing this game, that I already gave a doughnut to this girl. So the flour is actually for something else. And why do some characters repeat their requests all the time even if they were already fulfilled? I got really tired of going through the same places again and again hoping that something has changed. Eventually, I had to look in a walkthrough several times to finish the game. I love Murakami stories and I enjoyed references to them in the game but I did not enjoy the gameplay. So bad it's embarrassing.

The world building doesn't make any sense, the story doesn't make any sense, the dialogue is totally disjointed and never makes any sense... In short, this is some of the worst writing ever perpetrated.
Accordingly, none of the puzzles or inventory uses make any sense, and they all form an endless chain of non sequiturs.
This is probably the worst puzzle design I've seen in over 4 decades of adventure games.
No rhyme or reason to anything.

Easily a thick thumb down.

To which I could add a subpar interface (requiring massive keyboard input in what is supposed to be a point n' click,) rotten animation (of otherwise pleasing graphics,) some illegible texts, and a main voice actress who can't articulate her words (making subtitles a must.)
 I'm sorry, but I cannot recommend this game. The graphics are nice, but some of the puzzles make no sense and other are way overthought. The story itself is silly and characters flat and illogical. There are some minor bugs, that would be charming in a cool game, but are a bit annoying here.

It's not a terrible game. We bought it on a very discounted sale and I suggest you do the same. 

We rushed last 25% of the game with a walk-through just to see the ending. It's an acquired taste. Interesting puzzles, magical atmosphere and many different characters which don't have much to say yet still add to the magical aspect of the game world. Inspiration of Murakami can be felt to some degree I must say. ITS FUN",0.040682870370370335

Was absolutely not disappointed its an amazing game. The story is deep and seems to be up to personal opinion to an extent. The soundtrack is amazing and the ambient sounds in general are also very nice. The art style is interesting and unique, and its not hard to get every achievement fairly quickly for all the endings.

He also has a drawing in the sewers as graffiti, but I havent found it yet, but I am probably going to be devoting a lot of my time to finding it :) It's a really shitty parody of silent hill.

3 hours long, dated visuals, and crap gameplay with no story, after like 10 minutes I'm just lost and no idea what the point is and just quit and haven't touched it since.

I decided to watch a youtuber play it and well glad I did.  

Game kinda sucks but has some creepy moments, awesome sauce Absolutely awful game. Boring, generic jump scares, aggravating controls, zero story to speak of. Holy Balls...

Recently the devs released an announcement to try a demo of the NEW GAME they are working on, except the original game Kebab Chefs is being tossed aside for a quick cash grab. Like it's called ""Kebab"" Chefs, yet the game has very little to do around this and a whole mess of unbalanced foods into the mix, boring mini games and a lack of effort overall in the game.

Until the developers work on the game they promised all of us would be finished, I highly recommend NOT buying this game. Furthermore the game is pretty buggy and doesn't look like any of these are to be addressed anytime soon since each ""Update"" features nothing good for the people who bought the game.

This kills the puzzle aspect and he puzzles aren't even that good to begin with. A fun and not too hard puzzle game. Nice idea and not something I've seen before so quite original. It is probably a bit too easy at times even to get 3 stars but that isn't always bad. I'd like to have seen one more world that was actually a real challenge but as it is it is still a great game and well worth the low price. I love the way this game was created and i love that this game is very cheap like me who wastes all moneys what i get on steam and i have left like 2$ and there is hard to find good games with that price but this actually good game i love the pixel art and its kinda hard i haven't played it a lot but now i love it and that's what its now! A very fun and enjoyable puzzle game with some nice relaxing music.
Recommend to buy, especially on a sale! I loved this game, the challenges seem simple but in reality they are very well thought out and complex, having to deal with 3 different angles, geometry and spells with different mechanics makes this game a new experience at each stage. As for the art it is very colorful with attention to small details which makes this game have an engaging setting. I'm enjoying this game a lot. Nice and colorful voxel art, reminds me of playing classic toys and board games.
The game feel is relaxing and the level and spell progression are well balanced. The wizard gives you tips when you insist trying to do something wrong haha :)
And don't think this game is super easy, sometimes you'll have to be a great Wizard to solve those puzzles, has really good challenges. Enjoyable game. Got it for 50 cents on sale, and am now halfway through the last world. The puzzle dynamic is interesting, I really like the music and I think it's great that such a cheap game has quite some length. The only thing I didn't like is that the three star system isn't strict, in the sense that I found more efficient solutions for many puzzles, often in terms of moves, than was necessary to get three stars. Since I found the puzzles somewhat easy (except for puzzle 16 from world 2), I would have enjoyed it if it was more difficult to score three stars. The other thing is that the game crashed quite often (every half an hour, hour or so). The game automatically saves your level progress and restarting didn't take much time, but it was still somewhat annoying.",0.13463030303030296

Relive your adventures alongside the beautiful music of the game!,"I guess this is what peak sounds like Good OST is good. The DLC songs are included instead of being sold separately which is nice.
Worth picking up if you vibed with it while playing as per usual.

but...

Bad Labeling on tracks makes importing to and playing it from anything other than steam a pain to fix.

The DLC tracks have track numbers, but list the album as ""Monster Sanctuary (Original Ga"", but they do show titles.

The Non-DLC tracks do not have track numbers other than 01 (or literally no number/year for what is track 30), Artist, Album, Album Artist, or Titles. This makes finding the right track in a player extremely annoying if you haven't memorized the length or file size of what you're looking for.

Not really sure why this is the case as this particular weirdness is the first time I've ever encountered a lack of proper labels on an OST that came from steam. Not sure if it's the software I imported it to, but I doubt it considering it's not been an issue for more than a dozen other soundtracks before this one. This came along with the deluxe edition.  I really enjoyed the soundtrack to this game - all the songs are nice.  My favorites are the Champion Battle, Mountain Path, and Mystical Workshop. [h1]Overall album grade = A+[/h1]

There are quite a few bangers on this album. My favorites are #6 Champion Battle followed by #5 Combat as they synchronize well with the on-screen action and SFX sounds as you fight through battles. These songs build up over time echoing the increasing intensity of the battles. I really like the unique music in each zone, especially the very relaxing and inspired #12 Ancient Woods along with #3 Mountain Path.

I can hear very faint influences from other game OSTs in this album and I love it. For example, #10 Infinity Battle vaguely reminds me of music from the Lunar series. The melancholy #26 Blob Burg reminds me of Legend of Legaia. #20 Sun Palace would not sound out of place in Secret of Mana.

Once you discover the hidden mechanics (e.g. you can create boxes of your own), it takes a completely different angle. 

Surprisingly good bang for the buck :D My experience here was short and frustrating.

I've launched the game twice. Both times, it has asked me to click ""Agree"" to the same EULA. The game is tagged as ""full controller support"", but naturally you need a mouse and keyboard to actually play the game due to the EULA screen. So that's annoying, and makes it difficult to play on a Steam link with just a controller.

Second, the game frequently ""stops"", shows a spinning Windows cursor then jerks back to life 15 or so seconds later. It appears to do this each time I die or quit the actual game. Hard to tell. While this is happening, it appears to also fool the Steam Link and jerks things out of fullscreen and into the Windows desktop. So that's also annoying.

The UI is somewhat small and hard to read. The gameplay is a bit obtuse. Nothing overly so, but I can't say that it grabbed me. So far all I've done is shoot things and move through rings. I'd like to think there's more to the game than this, but my interest has been drained by all the little annoyances that have hit me to this point so I won't be continuing.

Not recommended: 2 out of 5. Maybe you'll have better luck than I did. Love this game. Really surprised it didn't do better considering how simple it is to understand and control, the best part comes after - learning how far you can take it! An incredibly creative game. Its more of an experience than a playthrough though but hey it is super cheap. This game has some potential and the mechanic is complex.
It has low frame cap (30fps) and way too many skills that probably require many hours to figure out.
Game is definitely playable but I felt there weren't enough excitement to continue playing. Shot a void into the energy source.
All of existence immediately collapsed into nothingness.

 Coniclysm is an abstract third person shooter where the player assumes the role of an intelligence adapting for survival in a strange new universe. Well, I got it for just 1‚Ç¨ through the sale, but still it's disappointing. The game feels very uneven, like made by an amateur. The tutorial is too long and too intrusive, you never really get to play and test what it tells you. The tutorial doesn't switch off automatically, you have to go to the settings. Even on the easy level you get very quickly killed, and after that the game is just over -- no savegame, no checkpoint, nothing. Each time you start from the very beginning, not even your player name is remembered. And after dying, the default option is not -- as one would expect -- to start a new game, no: the default is to visit the game's website. The end effect is that one has to make a lot of effort just in order to actually get into the game -- let alone enjoy it. This needs a lot of polish, even for a low price of 4‚Ç¨.

This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you. this game never works The essence of strategy, distilled to it's purest form. Its just a game of, is my number bigger than yours. No real strategy in the game, even the ""economy"" doesnt really effect this game. 

If you want a game like this, go for anything else like Superpower 1 or 2. Much better games. simple and fun, lacks different difficulties but also very beautifull graphics . Won't launch anymore for whatever reason. It's an incredibly simple RTS. It's good and fun with friends. I don't get all the bad reviews. It's simple, graphically and gameplay wise and that's a good thing.",-0.014483331211272373

Do not underestimate this game as it is a very reasonable price for it. Yes, of course, it still needs to be finalized and a patch, but this one has its own flavor and it is really playable, I really want to play it and this is really for fun If Adam Sandler was to make a video game, that would be it.

Nothing in this game makes any sense. Real roads from somewhere in the middle east with balloons everywhere. Real cars on the screenshots and videos, but badges are missing in the game ( to avoid paying licencing I suppose ).  The 'rubberband AI' seems to crash constantly. UI design looks as if it was drawn by a 12 year old with crayons. His favourite colours were obviously toxic green and pink.

I wish I could say something about the handling, however the game doesn't really have 360 controller support. It does seem to detect the input, but there is no way to reassign key mappings. I used to accelerate with the 'X' button back in 2002, trigger support please. The arrows seem to control both the car AND the chase camera. I dont understand how in a team of 10 people that made the game they all thought this is a great idea. If I want to steer my car left, that also rotates the camera left and I have no idea where am I going anymore.

On the plus side, congratulations to the developers for trying. This is the first game I have ever played from their country so I applaud their ethusiasm. However they should have started with something simpler. A Mario Kart clone maybe?

My review is negative for the obvious reasons, but by all means please buy this game. I suspect it will be taken down due to licensing in the next few weeks. Now is your chance to get it and show it to your friends after you have finished watching 'The Room'. A cringe classic in the making.",-0.03343304843304843
2133300,The Entity Code,game,False,"12 Oct, 2022",Indie,The Entity Code is a sci-fi themed 2D puzzle game with simple but challenging mechanics.,"Fun little matching puzzle game. It was short but enjoyable, ended up paying 80 cents for it during the last Winter Sale and it took me about 90 minutes to complete it. Besides the earlier puzzles most need to be solved within only 5 moves. 

The difficulty curve is nice and it slowly adds different elements to the puzzles throughout the game. The final puzzle was several back-to-back within a time limit and normally I don't like timed puzzles but the timer was fair and it felt satisfying to beat. It had a very minor story/plot and while it wasn't necessary it was still a nice touch. 

Overall I do recommend it but with a play time of roughly 2 hours you may want to wait for a sale. (Although full price is still cheap). A relatively short puzzle game which requires the player to transform a set of nine tiles on a board to mimic the target board in no more than five clicks, with each click on a tile turning adjacent tiles into the same shape as the one being clicked on. Later levels introduce three functional tiles which make tiles adjacent to them swap places, prevent them from being turned a different shape, or recall their shape before the last performed click. The fourth function introduced is not a tile; rather it is a register for storing the shape of the tile clicked on last which can then be used to replace any one tile on the board by clicking the right mouse button.

There is no ""undo"" button, but, with only five clicks to work with, resetting is fast enough. The game takes around two hours to complete. I had a good time with this game
It's a simple game but it manages to give some good challenges without being impossible to solve
5 moves max, the rules are well introduced and the difficulty is raised gradually

It's nice to see the game tried to add some story. Even if I find it a bit clichee and not very good it added some context and it was way better than nothing.

The other thing that was very welcome is the bit of time the Dev took to add some polish, coffee, particules and music to the game. It is to me what differentiate an unfinished project to a real product, and I really liked it.

Play as the smart-ass detective as he tries to discover who murdered the dame with the blue chewed shoe.","horrible crap compared to the first two episodes Short game but entertaining enough. Nice game. Silly, but stylish and fun. You have to use WASD for movement, that's a huge minus. Played the original Nick Bounty flash games when I was a kid and the jump in quality between the two.  Obviously it's not a perfect game, a bit clunky, but i'm just happy to have a longer Nick Bounty game Pros
- Good dialog lots of Humor
- Good voice acting
- Graphics seem a step up from previous title, a bit more detail in scenes this time around and some subtle particle effects and lighting.
- Noir themes are appreciated.

Cons
- Controls are awful; it says its better with a controller but the controller implementation actually uses a mouse pointer that you move around with the thumb-stick so its pretty tedious. The alternative is keyboard and mouse, you can't actually play the game with just the mouse as for some reason they disabled the ability to click to walk, although you can still click on a hot-spot and the character will walk to it (or try to walk, see my next point)
- Pathing and collision detection is one the worst I've ever seen. The character will frequently get stuck. If you click on an item then the character nearly always gets stuck in a walk animation trying and failing to walk over or if there is any static object in the world that's even remotely close then character slows down or gets stuck. Navigating some scenes can be a real chore.
- Camera can't be controlled, you can easily miss objects because its too zoomed in or just not the right perspective.
- Why is the main characters face even worse looking this time around.
- If you click on a hot-spot while the character is walking then it doesn't work, you have to wait for the character to be completely stationary.
- Occasionally on entering a new scene the character is unable to move for several seconds.

Overall a game for fans of the series or die-hard point and click fans only. I have played all the Nick Bounty games since they began as browser games and enjoyed them all. I would definitely recommend all of them. The Dame with the Blue Chewed Shoe was done very well. I look forward to hopefully seeing a new Nick Bounty game in the future. Great to see a true sequel to flash game classics.
In a weird way it fulfilled my want for an LA Noire style game, despite being very VERY different in tone and gameplay.
Runs well on Linux! I hope there will be more NIck Bounty cases to solve in the future This game was surprisinging delightful.  I played it thru 3 times to experience the dialog of all three sidekicks.  It was great humor, enjoyable story plot, good graphics,  and just all around silly fun.  Thoroughly enjoyed this--highly recommend. The same brand of crazy humour is still here. The main character is still a fairly competent noir private detective who lives in the modern-day world. It is still almost impossible to get stuck, as the solutions to puzzles are pretty obvious.

However, the game has really clunky, laborious movement which requires a keyboard this time. The speed is fine, but the path-finding is pretty buggy - upon clicking a hotspot, it is very common to see the character spin around it at least once to find the one ""correct"" angle to interact with it.

The game provides a few slots for manual saves. Use them. At some point I ran into a bug which did not let me collect all the necessary evidence at a certain scene. This blocked progression but was remedied by loading a save from an earlier scene. Not sure if it was related to my choice of partner - the cop-lady - as I could not replicate this bug with the other two.

The game takes around four hours to play through. It takes an additional hour to play it through with a different partner, loading a save right before the choice. In addition to hearing new lines of dialogue, it does slightly alter the way the final puzzle plays out, but I would only recommend that to dedicated fans though, as it is hardly worth it. 

[As a note: the final dialogue before the credits gives three options, only the first of which actually results in a meaningful reply from the partner; the other two elicit a dismissive silence and a confused grunt respectively]",0.014558692515214253

Fun competitive action for local multiplayer. We had a great time. Reminds me of classic Smash Bros in all the right ways, while still having it's own unique flavor.
The hookshot mechanics are a lot of fun, there's decent variety as far as items without there being too many to remember, and they're all visually distinct so it's easy to tell what you're picking up at a glance.
All of the characters feel unique while being similar enough to try a new character without too much of a learning curve.
The controls are pretty standard for the genre, so those familiar with similar games can pick it up and play without much trouble.
The single player modes are pretty similar to what you get from Smash Bros, but are different enough to stand on their own merits. The sports ball minigames are weird, but pretty fun.

Overall if you want something in the same vein as classic Smash Bros but with it's own unique flavor I'd highly recommend it, solid 9/10 for what it is with my main complaint being lack of online matchmaking. 4 out of 5
For a game that clearly was made to play with others you'll be surprised at how fun it can be to play alone and the many different challenges and party modes you will have fun with. The controls are easy to learn but hard to master, and the games are quick so it's really hard to get bored.

Positive: there's a lot of customization available, specially in the party mode, that's the best mode this game has to offer, even against the ai you will always have fun, you don't win or lose immediately in each round, your score grows a bit in each round until you've completed the whole party mode, and that keeps you from getting impatient or frustrated, you'll be always exited and hooked to your current game!

Negative: you'll see that the sport-type challenges (soccer, basket ball and volley ball) are the most frustrating of the challenges and it's difficulty doesn't change with the 4 different game difficulty settings, it's usually the same experience if you play against the ai in the campaign.

If you like Towerfall, Rocket League, Super Smash Bros, Megaman or Mario Party you'll probably like this game. At first, I thought this game was about robots and hooks‚Ä¶ booiii, I was wrong! It‚Äôs way more than that! I saw passion; I felt love and smelled the truth! This game made me rethink about friendship and family. 

So‚Ä¶ my best friend, Joseph ""Joe"" Baynes‚Ä¶ I finally got the courage to call him‚Ä¶ I invite him over last night just to play this gem. Context: Joe married my crush (Melissa) some years ago; I was pissed and lonely for a while‚Ä¶ I always saw Melissa as my soul mate and a potential wife‚Ä¶ Anyway, he came to my place and we talked like nothing happened; it was beautiful, nevertheless, he was stinking with a funny smell; I never figured out what was the smell or where did he come from‚Ä¶ Also, he was wearing some fancy glasses, just after realizing that, I noticed he was using a cotton patch in his right eye. At that point, I thought he will be having struggles playing Hookbots; booii, I was wrong! Joe kicked ass last night! Hooks and joy all dispersed in my room, just like the old times.  I named my bot ‚ÄúWANKA‚Äù and he named it ‚ÄúSUPER‚Äù, just like we used to as kids!

Life gives you lessons in the less expected ways; he told me that Melissa was a Guinea pig shopaholic and spends all Joe‚Äôs money in those little bastards. When Joe tried to talk about her problem, Melissa threw a brown Guine Pig to his head and hit him in the eye. Short after that, Joe got conjunctivitis in his right eye; now he‚Äôs always wearing that damn cotton eye patch.  Now I can‚Äôt imagine myself (in my deep fantasies) being married with Melissa, she sounds like issues‚Ä¶

It was midnight, I was going to finally beat Joe in a casual Hookbots battle; but something went wrong‚Ä¶ Joe received a call; a strong rodent screech was heard from his phone and scared him so much that he just threw my controller and ran away; he just disappeared‚Ä¶

As I already told before, life gives lessons in unexpected ways: If you think about it, if it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe I'd been married a long time ago, where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, cotton-Eye Joe?

Thank you, the developer, for making me a wiser person. Great party game. Movement feels great and battles are hectic. Plus the game has a lot of game modes that keep the game fun.",0.09695896316797958

It contains 2 sets of uniforms for all classes, plus a special officer uniform.","literally lets you play as Erwin Rommel The [b][i]Isonzo: Royal Units Pack[/i][/b] is a richly detailed and immersive addition to the WWI shooter, expanding the German faction with an array of uniforms and headgear from two iconic states of the ""Deutsches Reich"": Bavaria and W√ºrttemberg. This content pack provides players with historically accurate uniforms, headgear, facial customizations and more, offering a glimpse into the elite forces of these regions. For those interested in German military history, this pack is a must-have, brimming with unique touches that make each soldier stand out on the battlefield.

[h3][b]A Tribute to the Royal W√ºrttemberg Mountain Battalion[/b][/h3]
The [i]Royal W√ºrttemberg Mountain Battalion[/i] is a centerpiece of this DLC, featuring a set of six uniforms that immediately draw attention with their distinctive ""Litewka"" tunic. Known for their veteran status and their role in key battles, the W√ºrttembergers are depicted with the authenticity that fans of [i]Isonzo[/i] have come to expect. The inclusion of specific roles like the wire telephonist engineer and the minenwerfer ammunition carrier for the assault class adds a further layer of realism, allowing players to visually engage with the specialized duties that soldiers performed during the war.

The [i]Gebirgsm√ºtze[/i] mountain cap is another standout feature, adding a functional and iconic piece of headgear to the pack. This cap, paired with the rugged mountain uniforms, gives the W√ºrttemberg units a visually distinct look that sets them apart from other German forces, emphasizing their expertise in Alpine warfare.

[h3][b]Bavarian Flair ‚Äì Checkered Collar Tabs and Unique Headgear[/b][/h3]
The Bavarians are not left behind in the [i]Royal Units Pack[/i], with their own set of six uniforms sporting the instantly recognizable Bavarian checkered collar tabs. This attention to detail shows a dedication to historical accuracy, as these small touches were a point of pride and distinction among Bavarian troops during the war. The Bavarian uniforms offer a unique visual contrast to the W√ºrttemberg units, giving players the opportunity to explore different aspects of German military fashion.

The headgear for the Bavarians is particularly striking, with options like the [i]Feldm√ºtze[/i] and [i]Schirmm√ºtze[/i] caps, each featuring their state's distinct cockades (blue and white for Bavaria). The canvas-covered shako's with state-roundels are eye-catching and historically significant, adding an air of formality and prestige to the Bavarian forces. Especially notable is the bare Tschako headgear for officers, which prominently displays the state insignia plate, offering a more ceremonial look that distinguishes high-ranking figures on the battlefield.

[h3][b]Elite Customizations ‚Äì Facial Hair and Accessories[/b][/h3]
The [i]Royal Units Pack[/i] doesn‚Äôt stop at uniforms and headgear‚Äîit goes further by offering a selection of facial hair and facial items that enhance personalization and historical accuracy. The five facial hair styles include nods to notable historical figures, such as Nobel Prize-winning scientist and veteran Eduard Buchner and the legendary Erwin Rommel. These carefully styled mustaches and beards give your soldier a look of both experience and individuality, adding personality to your character‚Äôs appearance.

The facial items also include a special German cavalier smoking pipe engraved with the image of Kaiser Wilhelm II, a fitting and unique accessory that perfectly suits high-ranking officers or elite soldiers. This pipe is not only visually distinct but also adds an extra layer of historical immersion, letting players feel as though they‚Äôre embodying the real-life figures who shaped the war.

[h3][b]The Rommel Officer Set ‚Äì A Nod to Military Legend[/b][/h3]
One of the most notable additions in this pack is the special officer set inspired by the legendary exploits of Erwin Rommel during World War I. Known for his tactical brilliance, Rommel‚Äôs WWI experience is immortalized here through a ""Kleiner Rock"" tunic, a historically accurate face resembling the figure and his matching mustache. This addition is a wonderful homage to one of Germany‚Äôs most iconic military leaders and is perfect for players who want to embody Rommel‚Äôs legacy in battle.

Rommel‚Äôs uniform and facial customizations offer more than just historical significance; they provide a distinguished, elite look that sets your officer apart on the battlefield. Whether leading a charge or directing troops from a strategic position, your character will exude authority and experience.

[h3][b]Cosmetic-Only, but Immersive[/b][/h3]
It‚Äôs important to note that the [i]Royal Units Pack[/i] is cosmetic-only, meaning it does not change gameplay mechanics. However, the level of detail in the uniforms, headgear and facial items ensures that this DLC makes a significant impact on how players experience the game. The historical accuracy and attention to detail in this pack deepen the immersion, making battles feel more personal and rooted in the diverse military cultures of Germany.

Each uniform tells a story‚Äîwhether it's the elite status of the Royal W√ºrttembergers, the distinct Bavarian identity, or the leadership qualities of Rommel, the cosmetic enhancements allow players to step more fully into the roles of these storied soldiers. For players who value customization and historical depth, the [i]Royal Units Pack[/i] is a fantastic way to elevate the visual experience of [i]Isonzo[/i].

[h3][b]Verdict[/b][/h3]
The [i]Isonzo: Royal Units Pack[/i] is a beautifully crafted addition to the game, offering a deep dive into the unique uniforms, headgear and facial items of Bavaria and W√ºrttemberg during World War I. With a strong focus on historical authenticity, this pack not only enhances the visual diversity of the German faction but also adds a sense of pride and prestige to the units represented.

Whether you‚Äôre donning the mountain-ready uniforms of the W√ºrttembergers or sporting the distinctive checkered tabs of the Bavarians, this DLC ensures that your soldiers look as formidable as they feel. The inclusion of facial hair inspired by historical figures and the special officer set based on [i]Erwin Rommel[/i] makes this pack a must-have for fans of history, customization and immersive gameplay.

While it doesn't offer gameplay changes, the [i]Royal Units Pack[/i] makes a significant impact on the overall experience of [i]Isonzo[/i], bringing more character and personality to each battle. For players looking to take their German forces to the next level, this content pack is a worthy and highly recommended investment.

While not as exotic as the cold weather/stormtrooper variants, this one includes region-specific uniforms from germany who would've been seen as specialty or veteran units, the uniforms are also much brighter and crisper than the standard issue ones with regional marking on their collars. Overall a good pack, I am especially a fan of the Bavarian Telefonist Engineer that just exhibits everything I like about an engineer uniform. Really solid pack and doubled with the expedition pack make Germany the most diverse for uniform selection.

Pls add uniforms for Schwarzburg-Sondershausen next. Cavalier Pipe we all bussin' on the alpine front I really appreciate the devs sicking to historically/aesthetically appropriate DLC packs.

I bought this pack to support the WW1 series as they have an excellent track record of delivering solid multiplayer games that do not use excessive monetization tactics like loot boxes or season passes. I was a huge Insurgency fan and was very disappointed to see the Insurgency Sandstorm devs allowing excessive cosmetic DLC packs to get too flashy and inappropriate for that games setting and make it hard to distinguish what team the player is on. This makes me very appreciative for solid, simple, and fun multiplayer games like Isonzo.

All the WW1 games have also included a way to play the game solo against bots with custom difficulty which is a feature I think is essential for any multiplayer game to ensure that the game will still be enjoyable after the player base inevitably moves on to something else.

A possessed man is coming, a voodoo mask in his chest and lines of power in his back. Shadow Man is coming, trailing evil from Liveside to Deadside. To stop an apocalypse. To save your soul.","I'm late to the Shadow Man party but if I had played this as a kid then it for sure would have been a childhood favorite. The Soundtrack and vibes are off the chart. Exploration is a bitch, but if you're used to soulslikes or retro games, you should fair pretty well.

If you're stuck, talk to an NPC. my fav game of all time ever Atmospheric and fun. It's an old game so be prepared for dated gameplay, but its not about that. You're playing because its a weird freaking game that gets very, very dark and disturbing. You'll have weird dreams. You might have unusual feelings in liminal spaces. Have fun! absolute nightmare of a game Nightdive does it again with another perfect remaster, clearly done by people who loved the original game. You know how the flaws in a piece of media become the signature by which that type of media is recognized? I'm talking about VHS scanlines, technicolor oversaturation, handycam shaking, lens flare, tank controls, inventory management, static camera angles, low polygon count, etc.

Shadow Man feels like it lurks on the cusp of becoming its own modern style of game.

It's part collectathon, part third person max-payne-style dive-shooter, part metroidvania, part rpg. And for all it says DARK SOULS in its script, I'd honestly put forward that it's part Dark Souls with its large mazed environments and unlockable shortcuts and its environments carrying half the weight of its storytelling.

Shadow Man also has some unique jank to it. You're kind of expected to have read the (unfinished) Garth Ennis Valiant Comics run to know any of what the characters are talking about at the start of the game, but the script's also not so deep that you'll get lost if you haven't. The controls are not true 360, and the camera pans to specific axis around the character---this makes jumping forward pretty dang fragile, you'll often approach a ledge head on only to fling yourself sideways as you try to microadjust your angle during the leap. The game handles a controller well (god knows how they crammed this thing onto an N64 cartridge, but it *was* there at some point) but not perfectly---I had to remap lock on away from the shoulder buttons because the triggers next to them are how you shoot and I only have so many fingers.

Lastly, it's big.

Nightdive did a damn fine job with their restoration, not just remastering but returning cut content and fixing bugs (most of them---the asylum ledges can softlock you if you haven't talked to your girlfriend and your snake before jumping on them,) and this has only further cemented that Shadow Man is a large game. I'm going to come back and update my review periodically, so don't treat my playtime as indicative of the overall size, but expect a full featured game here.

Also a note should be made here about the voice performance. Everyone is on full scenery chew, it's great, but the script sort of wobbles in quality. A lot of the lines (which I'm guessing are from the comic, so go figure) feel like they're meant more to be read than spoken. The sound design is excellent, but sometimes background tracks and ambient sounds fade into the line reads in weird ways. High quality indie jank---the kind of thing you could deliberately build a game about. You have to be ready for it, but it's not bad.

Overall, I think this is kind of the definition of a cult classic. If you like late 90s / early aughts gothic media, you like platformers and collectathons, you like self-serious schlock, and you like games where a ton of care has been put into them---twice---you should really check out Shadow Man. And if you're of a game designing inclination, consider lettings its funk guide you into fleshing out a new subgenre.

Edit: I was an idiot. There's no softlock bug in the asylum. You can only grab ledges when you do not have both weapons drawn. This is a level of technicality that more modern games avoid due to frustration, but it really does connect you more with the deliberate feel of this thing. Also I started poking around the first of the restored areas unique to the remaster and it is gigantic and complex and challenging. A+ work by both the original dev team and the remaster team. There's a lot of game in this game.

2nd Edit: THERE IS A LOT OF GAME IN THIS GAME. It's also extremely flexible with how it lets you explore it. And I've now been to the second of the restored areas. The vibes are immensely evil. If you like liminal environments you'll love Shadow Man. This game is a treasure.

3rd Edit: There are some absolutely nonsense hidden areas on the game's critical path. The map is also, as is tradition in a metroidvania, as unuseful as possible. It feels great to explore areas for the first time, but there is SO much stuff to revisit for. Fortunately there's a ton of guides since this game has been out for a quarter of a century, but unfortunately it's really hard to give simple directions that will walk someone through all the BS nooks where the game tucks a plot-critical doorway or dubiously interactive switch, dial, or shootable engraved door. Even knowing how to interact with a given thing can take some guesswork. Those doors in the temple of fire that look like pushblocks, you're supposed to shoot them. The big cubes with the glowing orbs on each face that look shootable, those you're supposed to push.

4th: Average Shadow Man BGM be like *squeaky toy* *dentist's drill* *baby laugh* *woman screaming her lungs out in agony* *squeaky toy*. Sometimes you forget this is based on a Garth Ennis comic and then you're like ""oh, yeah, this is based on a Garth Ennis comic.""

5th Edit: Rolled credits at around twenty hours. It really feels like a marathon. The number of collectibles you need to get to the endgame is pretty dang close to 100% of the total number of collectibles, and that's plus the five mandatory retractors, three mandatory l'eclipser pieces, and five or so mandatory equipment pieces. Combat is also not this thing's strong point. It's about atmosphere first, secret hunting second, platforming third, and combat dead last. However. If the pacing doesn't put you off, this is a really rad title. Especially play it if you're thinking of getting into game design. It'll show you as many mistakes as moments of genius, and really hammers home the lesson that there's no one right way to make a thing. There's just you, your vision, and whatever steps you need to take to reach that vision. Do NOT choose ""The Horror"" difficulty for your first playthrough! Great creepy voodoo fun!

SGB is new if you didn't know and has very little assets to begine with.
That being said the DLC is a little bundle of relief the assets are of quality and worth it becouse you get alot more materials to work with when creating your game.

Pros- More assets and terrain to work with in your SGB project which is a releif
      Quality assets you can tell they really tolk some time and effert into puting the 
      DLC together.
Cons- Only one vehical design for the cars the other car models are just painted diffrent
      No 2D graphics for the 8 modern character models.
      
 Good quality assets in the G-Style pack. Not a huge collection, but all very good quality, equal to or better than the assets which come with the core product. 

A fairly western-sh city theme with plenty of street furniture and interior items (office, school, hospital etc). Could have done with some general household interior items but many of the included items could double up in a house setting, but I suspect the developer is saving them for another DLC.
This DLC is essential if you want a modern theme, and you can't create your own 3D assets. It includes animated characters, floor tiles, wall tiles, several building models, doors etc.

There is an included test level for you to play with which you can wander about in and wonder why everyone is driving on the left in what looks like an american city with a british telephone box, and the assets import into your own project with one button click. A nice way of delivering the DLC.

Reasonably priced fair value for money. The developer has done a nice job and the contents are sensibly thought out. Great little DLC pack for Smile Game Builder - chock full of modern 3D objects, ground/wall textures and with 8 adorable, bravely default-esque character models included.

The building models are especially useful for creating large, varied modern city maps and the smaller objects are nicely made and cover a wide range from office essentials to hospital equipment, vending machines to washing machines. Honestly, considering these are fully textured, often animated 3D models, the price is pretty great too.

I really hope we see more DLC in this style soon as I just can't get enough!",0.2729603651065915

Great little game. Fiendishly adictive and really really difficult. Must try this.

706020,Fade to Silence,game,False,"30 Apr, 2019",RPG,Fade to Silence is a single-player and co-op survival adventure set in a post-apocalyptic world that is frozen in an eternal winter. Snow and ice have shaped a merciless landscape. Nature is corrupted. Monstrous creatures out of an Eldritch horror dream roam the frozen wasteland.,"Bad. Awful. Clunky. Ugly. How do you fuck up gamedev this badly? I have very mixed feelings about this game. I give it a recommendation because I did enjoy it. I got it on a good discount and thought it was worth the money I spent on it. But it has it's issues and you have to be patient with it. It doesn't live up to it's full potential and that is disappointing.

Fade to Silence is set in a frozen post apocalyptic world where the player and a handful of other survivors that you find must struggle to survive in a harsh world filled with eldritch monsters and a deadly cold. You are constantly haunted and berated by a wraith figure who torments you and resurrects you when you die to continue the torment. You build a refuge with the other survivors and have to defend it against periodic and increasing attacks from the monsters. You constantly need resources to survive, and these resources are permanently depleted as you gather them, forcing to the player to push further into the frozen wilderness to get what you need to survive. You need to drive out the monsters to gain the resources they guard, having to capture strongholds from them so you can get even further into the frozen environment. You eventually discover the mysteries of the wraith and what caused the apocalypse.

This feels like it's 90% of the way to a really good game, but just didn't cross the finish line. As if the development was cut short without putting the finishing touches on it. There a lot of low level bugs that would have simple fixes that the player will encounter frequently. You will be inconvenienced by bugs, you will lose loot because of bugs, you will take damage because of bugs and you will die because of bugs. They seem to have fixed the really game breaking bugs that I've seen others report, but there's still a lot of little ones all over the place and you will experience them from time to time. Stuff like: cutting down a tree and seeing flying up in air due to dodgy physics and sometimes not coming back down, getting stuck in terrain and being unable to move, loot being tossed into unreachable places, a few loot items on the map are spawned in unreachable places, game sometimes not accepting movement input for 1 to 2 seconds after you exit a loot container or destroy a hive (lethal if the trash moon is dropping cars on you), taking damage and even being killed while a cutscene is playing (trash moon dropped cars on me when I found a wolf. I thought it was funny seeing the cars hitting all around during the cutscene of Ash reuniting with one of his lost wolves, but when the cutscene finished I was dead).

And it's not just the bugs that make it feel unfinished. There's also a lot of simple quality of life improvements they could implement but just haven't. There's a bunch of issues with balancing. The base attacks never felt like a real threat, just a minor annoyance that made me return to base at specific times. There's a conflict with how the story is given through dreams that you get during resting while the game mechanics pushing the player forward to get more resources as soon as possible disincentivise resting. This can cause you to miss most of the story content. The story finishes abruptly with a cutscene without any real final boss or showdown with the wraith which I found disappointing. I was hoping I'd finally get the extreme satisfaction from destroying the trash moon after it's been dropping cars on me all game, but sadly it doesn't happen.

There's some highly questionable design choices as well. For example there's a high level enemy called the stalker that excels at ambush attacks and is hard to escape from. They are a good enemy for the later areas as they keep you on your toes. Someone thought it would be a good idea to put a couple in the starting area. This honestly feels like they only put them there to troll new players and force early deaths. They are the kind of enemy that feels impossible to fight until you figure out how they work, but until then you will die to them a lot. Early players will often be outright killed without even knowing what's happening or even properly seeing the enemy that killed them, just a black mist zooming through them. I'm sure there are people who have rage quit and uninstalled because of this.

The combat is decent, but it's got it's issues. The lock on mechanic is good when fighting a single enemy, but against groups it gets annoying. The camera zooms in too much and you can't move it while locked on, so it makes you at risk of other attacks, like other enemies or the constantly spawning bombs that are near hives or the trash moon dropping cars on you. The enemies feel challenging at first, sometimes even unfair, but they each have a strategy that makes them easy to beat. Once you figure that out, they do start to become repetitive, but there's often other factors, like groups or the trash moon showing up, that complicate things enough to stop it getting boring. It could use a few more common enemies for variety.

The early game feels very difficult at first with a constant strain on limited resources and trying to survive in the harsh world, but this difficulty doesn't persist through the game. It drops off around the start of mid-game. You get plentiful resources and can craft decent (namely copper) equipment and good consumables, even more lives if needed. You've figured out the most common enemies mechanics so combat is not as dangerous and you don't die as much. And while there are harder versions of the common enemies late game and more of them, they don't really scale well with your equipment level, making it a bit too easy. The only things that will kill you at this point are bugs, recklessness and the occasional new enemy until you learn how they work.

Which gets me to the last issue: permadeath. This game is supposed to be built around this concept and references cycles repeatedly. You find many bonuses in the form of shards which improve your stats and boons that let you choose from some powerful bonuses. The catch is that they only apply after permadeath. The idea is supposed to be that you make it so far before the environment grinds you down and you come back stronger and get further each time. But because the difficulty drops off around mid-game and you steamroll to the end, you don't really experience this. It kinda ruins the idea and most players will try to avoid permadeath at all costs to avoid losing game progression when the permadeath is supposed to be a part of the game progression. The mechanic needs a bit more work to flesh it out so players are pretty much forced to get the permadeath boosts in order to progress. The wraith is supposed to be tormenting you with endless cycles after all and there are plenty of people who finish it without ever experiencing permadeath which defeats part of the point of the game.

All that said, the game is enjoyable to play. The environment feels great. You really feel like you're in a post-apocalyptic world struggling to survive. The blizzards are a real threat and the game mercilessly punishes recklessness and lack of preparation. The story and characters are immersive and there is a consistent theme of moving on from loss and past mistakes. The narrative is dripped out slowly keeping up the mystery very well. The trash moon looming over the world is very imposing and having to dodge the cars it's dropping down on you from above is an experience, especially when it can show up at inconvenient times. The threat of permadeath does make dying more consequential and the threat of defeat more real, rather than many other games where you can just reload at a checkpoint.

Overall I would rate it about a 6 out of 10, with the potential to be a 8 or even 9 with a bit more work by the developers to fix the bugs and other issues to bring out the game's full potential. A good pickup if its on a sale if you want a post apocalyptic survival game that is a bit different from most and are willing to be patient with it's issues. Not the best co-op/multiplayer experience, but a fun game all the same. Not my style of this genre of games.  

I've played 7D2D, Long Dark, Icarus, etc.  This seems to have an interesting story but it just... I don't find the game play worth it.  I tried and tried - over 20 hours - and I just don't care for this.  Maybe co-op but not like this. i like the game, for full price idk if its worth it for a casual player, but its challenging so that is a nice breath of air. needs some more momentum and help off the start. i read through the in game notes and they are lacking to say the least. the things you get to keep after permadeath are extremely lacking. i probably wont put in anymore time since the achievements are only available through permadeath mode. i do not hold that against this game though as it is how its intended to be played. unplayable game so many bugs The game was good (compared to most games we get now days) but I recommend this game more because I want to see an even better game like this in the future. The first part of the game was really fun. Discovering the mechanics and world. But after some time I saw more and more thing that I didn't like.
Combat is very easy at its core. This was made for controller 100%. What made the game hard was actually the character movement. So slow to start running, rolling, hitting. 
Then looking at the items, just a handful of them, and you don't even need to use all of them to finish the game. 5 types of enemy = you get used with them very fast.
Limited backpack space. Why? So you spend more time running back and forth. 
Collect 1k gems. Why? You don't need them but you spend more in game time. Reminds me of collecting posters in Far Cry = boring. 
Moving trough zones step by step like Shadow of Mordor, so you can build your character is no a fun thing. Having a more openworld like Witcher 3 or Gothic would have made the game so much better.
I hope they make a second game. With more focus on the story, character development, openworld. And less of repeat the same over and over just so you spend more time.



 I wanted to love the game but well the game is just meh 
combat trash .
movement feels bad .
controls kinda painfull at first to get used to it 
world looks nice frosty ice cold no emotions dead inside frozen to the bones

game is a 3/10 
it could be better but its bad 9 / 10
Great, but there are lots of flawed decision making.

I'm impress with the game and surprised that it did not do better in sales .(You pay 29 for a dlc those days...).",-0.00841208581774623
2253580,The Space Bar,game,False,"30 Mar, 2023",Adventure,"Play as Alias Node, a human detective working on planet, Armpit VI. Your assignment? Catch a shifty criminal, wanted for grand theft and murder, before whatever it is, escapes to another world!","Extremely thankful this came out on steam in a seamless format. No ISO switching, audio is not buggy, runs great compared to the ScummVM version i tried a while back. Exceptionally underrated and difficult point and click game that is truly unique. EDIT2: tl;dr: this is a deceptive, buggy release with a game-breaking bug. DON'T buy.

My review is mainly in regards to this Steam release, as I would stil absolutely recommend you to play this game. Yes, like other adventure games (Edna & Harvey: The Breakout comes to mind regarding this game; this game's Empathy-Telepathy is compareable to Breakout's ""Tempomorph"" feature, the whacky characters and well-placed fourth-wall-breaks being other similarities), The Space Bar is VERY cryptic, but it makes up for it on style, humor and ESPECIALLY immersiveness. This release, though I am happy that it is available digitally, is just not up to my standards with one aspect ABSOLUTELY making me mad @ Jordan Freeman Group and detering me from recommending anyone from buying this Steam release.

1. First of all, the game has a few issues. The Steam Overlay doesn't work and even if it did, you would have to rebind the screenshot key since F12 quits the game and you can't remap anything there (not that you would need to otherwise). In addition, the game runs at VGA/480p. Not a problem by itself, that's just the game, but scaling it to a resolution like 1024√ó768 would make any overlay more usable; Windows Game Overlay barely works and the AMD Adrenalin software is unusable at 480p.

2. There are several bugs in this version. There is one graphical option in the game regarding ""Perspective Correction"". For some reason, it is not turned fully to the right in this release by default. Even if you do, you have to do it every time you play the game since it doesn't save that setting. Probably it doesn't save any of the other settings as well! There were two crashes, but they weren't too bad. What is really bad is that the game freezes sometimes at certain points. The Vildroid flashback briefly froze on me several times in the locker room for example. What's worse: In several instances, the game freezes while skipping dialogue. This means the ""CHAT"" option with Fleebix in the Thud flashback straight-up exits if you select anything and to this day I have only heard half of the ""FINISHED"" option when chatting with My and Ty. A shame since that line seems to be one of the many well-placed fourth wall breaks. I suspect this has something to do with the included D3D9 wrapper that also seems to cause problems on the Steam Deck.

EDIT: It actually gets worse. I just finished the Fleebix flashback, that has numerous occurrences of freezes with line skipping around the Quantelope Lodge! The first one is having Thud press the blue button in the clocktower, which is not that bad. What is bad is that the audition introduction is skipped with a freeze, as is everything but the first few words of the congratulatory message after completing the audition! In addition, I have noticed another bug of this version, also most likely wrapper-related: Rarely, bottom text disappears within a second, meaning you can't read it unless you take a screenshot (not possible through Steam, remember). This happens when picking up drinks ordered from the DrinkVendor 2000 and it also happens when you try to go underwater in the Moist Grotto. I have only ever finished the Fleebix and Thud flashbacks in their entirety, so it's VERY likely there are numerous other bugs of these sorts in the game.

EDIT2: Cilia's flashback also freezes on me frequently, especially when being catched by the Akro Mati regime. Deven-7's flashback freezes even more often, in particular when a negotiating team returns. This is quite bad as you basically have to look up the results separately all the time. Even worse still, and this might be a game-breaking bug (!), if you suceed, you are somehow unable to progress. You can select ""CHAT"" with Deven-7 in the bar, but there are no options and you can only exit the conversation by hitting escape. I haven't found a way around this yet, meaning you CAN'T COMPLETE THE GAME. You need the high frequency jammer from him and you can only get it by betting with him after completing the flashback successfully!

3. I paid 14,99 EUR for The Space Bar. Not unfair by itself, that's what I paid for my physical copy and you get cloud saves, easy install and no disk-swapping. It has since been reduced to 14,79 EUR, the same as on the ZOOM Platform. Only problem is that the ZOOM Platform release features extra goodies such as Concept Artwork, Magazine Ads and so on. And I get it, Steam wants a cut, but what I don't like at all is that the ZOOM Platform release includes the OST. On Steam, you don't even get it as purchasable DLC as with other games.

4. This release is supposedly the ""Digital Edition"" with, according to Jordan Freeman Group, ""higher-quality cutscenes and audio"" from an unreleased DVD Edition. As far as I can tell, this is at the very least dubious, probably just a straight-faced lie. The intro of the game (LOGO3EX.SMK, found on the first Disk), is 103 MB in the original CD release I have. And in this supposedly enhanced new release? 103 MB. Not that you could tell that many differences at 480p. So either these files from the ""unreleased DVD Edition"" (whose existence I am highly doubtful of) are exclusive to the Super Digital Deluxe Edition exclusive to this ZOOM Platform, which would be a real slap to the face since there is no clear indication and that one was cheaper right after release, or the Jordan Freeman Group made it up.

14,99 EUR for that, Jordan?!

EDIT: I really appreciate the positive feedback guys! In regards to Sentry, if they have even admitted that these ""higher-quality cutscenes and audio"" is bonus content, than there is no other way to put it: They have been deceptive on purpose. In the venturebeat.com article about the then-upcoming re-release, Jordan Freeman himself says: ""It is with sheer joy we digitally present the previously unreleased DVD edition of Boffo Intergalactic Games‚Äô The Space Bar, with higher resolution cinematics and improved audio. [‚Ä¶]"". There is nothing ambiguous about that statement, it CLEARLY indicates this is the supposedly previously unreleased DVD edition with higher resolution cinematics and so on, not these things being secretly exclusive extras. To this day, the bonus content on the ZOOM site is listed as ""Concept Artwork, Lossless Theme Music, Magazine Ads, Signed Poster Scan"", not a word of ""higher-quality cutscenes and audio"", indicating that it also should be in the Steam release. This is unacceptable, even if they apparently further reduced the price to 9,75 (I should have waited!), especially for a release riddled with issues.

EDIT2: Even the game-breaking bug notwithstanding, this is an unacceptable release. It seems instead of fixing it, Jordan Freeman Group or whoever is upvoting the two positive reviews. By people who barely played the game, one of them only having posted a review of another Jordan Freeman Group-published game. For some reason that alludes me, one of those reviews is listed as ""most helpful overall"", even though it has the same number of upvotes and far less comments than this one.",-0.01254907592407592

This was an astoundingly vapid and empty game. I‚Äôd say it reminds me of low-effort Flash games from the aughts, but honestly I think that would be an insult to them. At least they had a modicum of originality. This game is just a string of dumb dadaist non-jokes (plus a lot of ‚Äújokes‚Äù that consist entirely of ‚ÄúWe made a reference!‚Äù) interspersed by generic RPG Maker gameplay that consists of ‚Äúpress Attack to win‚Äù. I have no idea what the developers were even trying to do, and even more baffled why this has so many positive reviews. I refunded it despite it costing less than a dollar, because I literally don‚Äôt want to give these hacks a single cent.

I have to say, I think at a certain point these corporate chic parodies reinforce corporatism more than they criticize it. Capitalism is not a force of nature that does things for no reason, but capitalists are very invested in making you [i]believe[/i] it is because that makes it harder to question. Regurgitating that propaganda, even satirically, is doing their work for them. (I‚Äôm reminded of Disco Elysium, which in fact [url=https://space-blue.tumblr.com/post/771289170540920832]made this exact point,[/url] because despite also being an absurdist dark comedy it uses anti-capitalism as a genuine belief instead of an aesthetic.) i got stuck in an area because whenever a random encounter occurred the game would crash This started out kinda neat but it ended up being a lot more frustrating than fun. For 99 cents, I can't complain too much. Ultimately, it went from interesting to mid to meh to ""why is this combat system so ass?"" nice little rpg maker game. Incredibly mid, it's a RPGmaker game without good RPG combat. 
Story sucks too.
Visuals are really nice but thats all it has going for it A Business RPG features quirky humour, unique hand-drawn art, a capitalist dystopia and classic combat. [h1]Intro[/h1]
Suits: A Business RPG asks us the question that many other RPGM games had asked: what if I made a RPG Maker game that is very fucked up?

In that regard, Suits does manage to hit the mark. Clearly reminiscent of hit pieces like OFF, this short little game brings us through a fucked up story line about how capitalism can destroy a society from the inside and gut it from the inside out. While the positives are very positive, the game still has some errors that holds it a bit back from its full potential as a true Fucked Up RPGM Game classic. Let's dive in a little bit.

[b]TL;DR:[/b] A solid 7/10 game on the Fucked Up RPG Maker Games with great inspiration from OFF. An overall good experience only held back by too many silly 420 jokes and some unpolished and unbalanced gameplay that can feel a bit frustrating at times. At 4 hours of playthrough without going 100% (althokught it's possible) it's a great value for 1$

[h1]Positives[/h1]
Let's start with the wrapping. Art-wise, this game clearly drinks from cult classic OFF aesthetics: hand drawn, black and white and grotesque. Still, it manages to have its own vibe and tone, setting the game as colorless from the beginning instead of having the colors fade and making the hand drawn, pen on paper style very clear. The simple pixel art for sprites contrast with the intrincate designs of sprites in combat.

The OST hits the mark with its dark and industrial ambient [spoiler](save the song about dinosaurs)[/spoiler] that is unsettling enough for us to never feel comfortable in any part of the game. Pitched up or down versions of some song can be heard in combat, adding to the strange eerines of the whole ambiance. Overall, a great work form the composer to make us feel like we don't truly belong here.

Finally, the narrative and story in the game is compelling enough for me to keep going. It helps that my anarchist ass also wants to see capitalism crash and burn under it's own weight, so I might also be a bit biased here. Still, it has some shortcomings that I will go into later.

Summing it all up:
[list]
[*] Good stilistic and art choice
[*] Pretty well made OST
[*] Interesting plot points and little secrets
[*] Overall narrative feels compelling to follow
[/list]
[hr][/hr]
[h1]Negatives[/h1]
Starting where I left it on the positives, the narrative is held back by the insurmountable amount of 420 and scatological jokes. Don't me wrong, I love weed jokes as much as the next guy, but when you have this game trying to tell you a complex story about how capitalism is a soulless machine feeding the meat of discarded workers back to them, it takes you off a bit when there are constant clocks at 4:20 or you find ""a dank bag of oregano"". I get it, but it feels a bit too much at times.

On that note, some scenes and dialogues feel weirdly too sexual. Again, I'm not against it in a pearl-clutching puritanical way, but more like ""why is this here"". Especially [spoiler]on the 5 minutes wait section at the bank (which, btw, pretty funny on its own)[/spoiler] it really felt uncomfortable at times, since I literally can't do anything as a player to move away from the situation. As much as a I get that is a dark game with dark comedy and all, in this specific case it felt a bit unnecessary.

Finally, let's talk gameplay. Usually a RPGM game is gonna have, well, RPG elements, specially turn based combat. Ignoring the shortcomings that may occur just by the fact of using RPGM as an engine, the combats themselves seemed unbalanced, specially with the addition of Jerome. Seeing that obtaining the one and only party member of the game feels like a secondary quest that can be missed, It's not hard to imagine that combat could get frustrating fast as a one man army. But with Jerome, having the chance of paralysing enemies from 1 to 5 turns to do whatever you want, some boss battles are incredibly trivialized, including the final boss battle, which takes away most of the dramatic charge of the encounter.

Additionally, random encounters, especially in the Undercity, feel way more powerful than their boss counterparts. Farming for some upgrades felt complicated and a bit hard on resources, since save points don't recover HP/MP, but then getting said upgrades and leveling up felt like overkill for certain bosses, since there is a real chance of perma stunning them for the whole combat.

Summing it all up:
[list]
[*] Narrative and overall dialogue is held back by a bit too much of weed and sex jokes
[*] Gameplay lacks polishing and balancing
[*] Jerome feels simultaneously too strong because of paralysis and too weak because of low damage output
[*] Lacking a heal on save mechanic strain too many resources on healing items
[/list]

[h1]Conclusions and final notes[/h1]
Suits: A Business RPG is a love letter to the classics and an overall enjoyable experience if you are used to games on this vibe. With a final personal score of a 7/10, I'd say it's a good entry point in the subgenre of Fucked Up RPGM Games at 4 hours of game time for 1$.

Great references to Mortis Ghost and the Batter, by the way. Got a chuckle out of me Definetly worth it for a dollar or less.

On Tuesday night, a new video game got released, based solely on my true existence. You can paint the levels like how I painted my face.

Good joke. Everybody laugh.
*roll on snare drum*
*curtains* cool idea cool funny Disclaimer: My scores/reviews are almost always based on having bought the game at close to the ""lowest historical price"" on steam at time of purchase.

Quick score: 3/5

Notes: Pretty basic platformer with a decent art style and a visual gimmick. Unfortunately the gimmick isn't really used in any interesting ways and is just kind of a pre-level chore you need to complete before actually playing the game. Difficulty is maybe average or slightly below and the game can be completed in about 30 minutes without any real replayability.

Wouldn't recommend playing the game with a controller, so avoid if that is your intent.

Also another annoyance worth mentioning. For some reason rather than have a variable jump button, you have 2 seperate jump buttons for short and long.

Not great but not bad. 
For .49 cents sure why not. Annoying to play with a controller. Using the button is a mini hop. You have to press up on the joystick to actually get a proper jump. Feels awkward because when you're moving to the side and trying to jump it's sort of this over and up motion which doesn't feel right. Can't think of any platformer that I've ever played that had that.

Other than that, I found it way too trial and error right from the start. Ease the player into the game with the hidden mechanic. I really don't feel like grinding from 1 minute in. Super Cable Boy and Charge Kid are a couple I'll recommend for others to check out. Those are fun, challenging and have a nice difficulty progression. Cute little game and at such a low price! It has some pretty interesting mechanics that make it a nice spin on the precision platformer genre. Challenging but really well crafted and the sound design and palette work is really cute. That being said I would like some adjustments or additions in the future, like the option to pick a palette, adjustable controls (I prefer arrowkeys and z over wasd), and maybe even like a little crt filter and some extra levels, heck I'd even pitch a couple bucks towards a deluxe edition upgrade or sequel with those adjustments. That being said I do get stuck on some levels due to the puzzle design (the fall guys level is takin me quite awhile, wish it was maybe towards the tail end of the levelpack), but overall I think for 99c, sometimes 50c on sale, there's no way you can go wrong with a purchase. i played the game This is a very fun retro platformer with an original twist at a bargain price point. There are many precision platformers on Steam and this one manages to add something new. A must buy for fans of the genre. Platformer where most of the map is covered up, and you have a limited number of 'splatters' to reveal parts of the level. Not particularly challenging but still fun, and considering how cheap it is, it's worth picking up.",0.07425463425463424
2343160,ROGUE-FP,game,False,"30 Mar, 2023","RPG, Strategy",A blend of old school gameplay and new school controls. Experience a classically styled roguelike in a way you never have before!,"Quite unique take on a classic rogue-like, liking it! [b]I like ROGUE-FP.
I recorded my progress in ROGUE-FP, as well as some observations & thoughts.
Please take a look if you prefer a more audio / visual format.[/b]
https://youtu.be/JCIjBNmouNQ

ROGUE-FP is an Indie, turn based Roguelike Dungeon Crawler that is First Person.
It is Rogue, in a more accessible, striking first person perspective.
Would you like to know more?

[h1]A More Accessible Take on Rogue?[/h1]
Yes.
ROGUE-FP has the random dungeons of Rogue, made with Procedural Generation, but rendered in a striking, ASCII inspired, first person style, massively improving the immersion in the dark, yet simultaneously vivid and eye-catching dungeons.
ROGUE-FP feels very Matrix like, yet fantasy, and not everything is green, with a lot of brightness, spaced in-between and against very dark backgrounds, if that helps explain it better.
It‚Äôs really one of those things that must be seen.
I like it.

Plus, ROGUE-FP has 5 difficulties; available right at the start; good.
I‚Äôm playing on Medium here, because hunting for secret doors all day is not fun‚Ä¶
Thankfully, the gameplay is.

Controller Support is present, as are rebindable keys, but I found the inventory navigation with the gamepad not great, only able to use items, not throw or drop them; not great.
Thankfully, good old Mouse and Keyboard control is present, and very good, so that is mostly what I used in the above video.

While I did enjoy my time with ROGUE-FP, I did find many areas where it would be even better.
Please let me know if any of this is off-base, but I find directness works best here. 
I will try and keep this organized.

[b] Tech / Bugs:[/b]
[h1]1: Bug: Listen To The Controller Game![/h1]
After alt tabbing out, then going back in, it takes a bit before I can look around again with the controller.
This can easily get you killed, as it seems you must move around with the gamepad a bit to get the game to remember it is being used.

[h1]2: Bug: I Found a Secret Door, on Medium‚Ä¶[/h1]
Intended?
I thought those were limited to the highest difficulty?

[h1]3: Scale That Inventory Window![/h1]
Having to Mouse scroll the tiny thing every time I open it, rapidly gets annoying.
Simply scale it so everything in it is visible at once if the inventory is opened; that would be much more user friendly.

[h1]4: MY EYES![/h1]
Ouch.
What a painful title screen.
It looks good when you‚Äôre not trying to do anything on it, but if you are‚Ä¶
I found the frequently moving screens very distracting; and it hurts my eyes when I‚Äôm trying to go through the game options.
I strongly suspect this will really bug others as well, so please pause the constant screen looping when the options screen is open.

[h1]5: Which Should I Choose?[/h1]
Dig Dungeon? Classic Mode?
What does that mean?
The simple action of starting the game should not generate confusion‚Ä¶
This represents a failure on the first screen.
I strongly recommend replacing the current options with a simple ‚ÄúStart Run‚Äù or something, then another window, with a pop-up message explaining the difference between the 2 options.

[b]Gameplay Suggestions:[/b]

[h1]6: It‚Äôs Black on Black![/h1]
Should really warn the players when they walk out into the blackness, as the pit fall will kill them, yet it can be very difficult to see, given that the floor and walls are also often black!

[strike][h1]7: Fast Throw Badly Needed![/h1]
Having to open inventory, mouse scroll down to select your darts / shurikens, then RMB over them in order to throw one feels slow and terrible!
A hotkey for fast throwing is needed here; badly![/strike]
[b]Edit: You can directly equip and throw the arrows without a bow[/b]
I did not think to equip and throw the arrows; just so use to needing the bow.
Now I know.
This will make handling snakes much less toxic to my muscles!

[h1]8: Jump Please![/h1]
I‚Äôm an athletic Fighter-man, not a squishy wizard-man, let me run and jump!

[b]Edit: Don‚Äôt need bow; can just throw[/b]
Would still like a bow
[strike][h1]9: At least Start Me With a Bow Man![/h1]
Let me range those snakes, and put my starting 24 arrows to use!
It‚Äôs just a tease otherwise!
Plus, those strength draining snakes are brutal![/strike]

[b]Not Strictly Rogue Gameplay Suggestions:[/b]
I gave this one its own category, as I understand the idea here was to cleave as closely to Rogue as possible, while putting your own spin on it, but basic Rogue feels very limited today.

[u]The addition of more player choice here would only help the game, while allowing an opportunity to more sharply delineate the differences between the classic mode, and a game that is Rogue like, but not strictly rogue in first person, plus monster bits.[/u]

[h1]10: Starting Absent Any Healing Feels Really Bad.[/h1]
We have no pocket prayers, no starting healing potions, or spells to help us out; if we get poor luck, we just die.
We are an extremely unprepared, poorly equipped, fighter wanna be, sent down here to die.
These abilities, added to roguelikes like the excellent NetHack, classic ADoM, or ToME, present tools the player can use to offset and survive terrible RNG: that these features are not present here really hurts the gameplay, reducing it to RNG map luck, and knowing to avoid fighting certain monsters like snakes unless they are sleeping.

[h1]11: No Choice on Lvl Up?[/h1]
The total lack of player choice concerning lvl ups from Rogue and Nethack, paired simultaneously with the lack of depth with the complete removal of any classes here, does much to remove much of the possible depth of the game.
This results in runs that feel very similar.
This is bad.

[h1]12: Let Fighter-mans Learn![/h1]
Listen: I know he‚Äôs not smart: he can‚Äôt even read!
[i]I bet those scrolls are actually written in common; he‚Äôs so ashamed![/i]
But he can learn!
It‚Äôs not his fault!
Just give him a chance!
At least give this man an Int score!
Let him try!
Maybe with enough Int, he can learn to read?!
Maybe even learn some magic from spellbooks!
Anything to be more than just another dumb fighter!

[h1]13: % = Down Stair?[/h1]
Why not >?
That % was really throwing me.
Yes, it looks like an escalator (how deluxe), but just used to the greater than.
Maybe add an option to swap them in options?

Anyway, my many critiques aside, I did enjoy my time with ROGUE-FP.
ROGUE-FP is an Indie, turn based Roguelike Dungeon Crawler that is First Person.
It is Rogue, in an accessible, striking new look.
Watch? This is an updated version of Rogue (1980) its got a fresh coat of paint, the swap to first person, and time only taking effect when you perform an action. 
There are two game modes available Dig dungeon and Classic mode.
Dig Dungeon is the developers own little twist on the classic with more unique level generation and the addition of monster bits occasionally dropped by slain enemies that provide small bonuses.
Classic mode is as close to a faithful recreation as possible to the original for better or for worse. Awesome game, true to the original. This is a rather remarkable version of Rogue, and I'm inclined at an early stage of engagement with it to state that it may very well be the definitive version of this storied, honored, and hugely influential classic- especially for modern audiences. The first person perspective totally works and importantly, it still feels 100% like Rogue. Veterans of the game will feel a strong sense of ""home"" with it, while also enjoying the change in format. The hybrid ASCII/3D graphics are BRILLIANT, capturing Rogue's unique atavism and abstraction without sacrificing  modernity. I love the monster bits, which add a fun set collecting angle to equipment upgrades. Again, it's a feature that wasn't in the original game but feels absolutely true to the spirit of the core design. While it doesn't have the ludricous depth, lore, or complexity of Caves of Qud and similar modern roguelikes, there is an elemental simplicity here that is both charming and appealing. The tutorials are excellent and non-obtrusive, and the UI is uniformly excellent and easy to navigate. For five bucks, this has got to be one of the best bang-for-the-buck purchases you can make here on Steam. A respectful but innovative edition that should have a higher profile among today's game players. Two things I should mention first: 
1. In the grand scheme of things I've barely touched this game yet, so I'll sink in a few more hours into it, then maybe edit this review if necessary. 
2. I have never played the original ""Rogue"" but I have a combined total of well over 1k hours in rogue-likes in general.

So far, this is really, really good! Time only moves when you do, or when you do an action like equipping a different weapon or something, so you have the time to strategize and plan your next move. The art style is seriously phenomenal too, although I can see why some people wouldn't like it. Falling down a pit can kill you if your health is low enough (I think), but otherwise you just go down a level, and I think that's neat. Enemies drop ""Monster Bits"" that you can use to slot into your armor, and some of them can even be eaten if you don't have an alternative source of food. The game also doesn't feel as punishing as some other rogue-likes, and some of the monster bits even up the chances for finding specific stuff in the dungeon like wands or weapons or whatnot.
Also, you can actually use explosives to break down the walls of the dungeon, opening new pathways.

I don't really know what to say other than it's well worth the full price, and that YOU SHOULD TRY THIS GEM!!!!! TLDR: An amazing re-imagining of a classic dungeon crawler that many, like myself, have never been exposed to. Highly recommend for everyone who is a fan of dungeon crawlers, modern or traditional, and rougelike fans. This game is insanely fun and an instant classic. 10 Emus out of 10!!!

OH MY GOD THIS GAME IS SO FUCKING GOOD!!!!! I'm a huge sucker for dungeon crawlers that take place in a single dungeon so I already loved the idea of this. Then I come to learn that this is a twist on a game older than me!! Did some more digging and learned that this is basically that very same game but with a modern angle!! This game is great, even though im having a tough time getting past floor 7 on Rouge difficulty, its still super fun to play. 
If you're a fan of dungeon crawlers than this is the game for you!! 

It has a tab in the main menu title ""How To Play"" and it does seem a little overwhelming at first glace because of the amount of information, but I promise you it's not that bad and if you're familiar with games like this then you'll catch on pretty fast. It also helps that a more active tutorial is available as soon start your first dungeon dive. This gives you a shortened, more hands on approach of the tutorial and even mentions that the ""How To Play"" tab will have more detailed information. However, if you're like me, you'll click that first before entering the dungeon for the first time. The active tutorial teaches you things as you encounter them as well which is a great way to teach someone.

There is also a ""Classic Mode"" which emulates the original Rouge's dungeon layout. This mode is a little bare bones compared to the normal dungeon, but it's still a fun experience. Same enemies and random drops as far as I can tell from what I've played of the classic mode. I usually play this mode as sort of a ""speed run"" mode just because of how flat it is. That's not a knock either, it's still really fun to run through and it's neat that players can experience what the original game was like to some degree.

During my googling I had also learned through a reddit post that this is the creator's first game and I have to say I'm really impressed. So I just wanted to take the time real fast and say thanks for recreating a classic that I had no idea even existed before this game. I also want you to know that I will also be purchasing a GOG copy so I can be sure to have this game forever.  I really enjoyed playing the original rogue but it was always difficult getting back into it cause of how dated the game is. That being said I am thoroughly enjoying Rogue-FP , the developer put in a lot of love into revitalizing this classic game while adding their own subtle touch to it. One of the best games I own. Period.
 While not having the entire featureset and depth of the original Rogue (and especially not Nethack, the gold standard in my eyes), this game is a brilliantly done reinterpretation of Rogue with cool graphics option (will always prefer the funky ASCII/textured environment option) with loads of deadly twists and turns with two game modes to explore.

1030330,Wolf or Boy,game,False,"22 May, 2019","Casual, Indie","Wolf or Boy is a simulation game in which you can experience a physiological battle between humans and werewolves. Hearing a rumor that horrible murders are repeated in a village in the middle of nowhere, you decide to visit the site. Apparently, how they got killed is not a human beings doing. There are werewolves amongst the villagers..","Lets get the verdict out of the way: *MISSED OPPORTUNITY!*

That being said, let me explain why the above has been determined after close to an hour of playing this game.  This game has a poop show of misleading sales pitch in the ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù section of the games store page.  Quite literally every single point that is made on the ‚ÄúAbout Page‚Äù uses a kernel of truth, that is worded in a way to bloat your expectations.   Let me start by explaining the features point for point:

*This game is based on the popular table game ‚ÄúAre You a Werewolf?‚Äù*
	Should have been a trigger warning that you based this around the bargain bin version of ‚ÄúThe Village‚Äù.  While not an inherently bad problem with the game, it is a symptom as the game itself seems to miss the most important part of the table top that makes that game so much fun‚Ä¶  The player interactions.   You have literally no legitimate character interactions in this game.  Every ‚Äúchoice‚Äù you make just triggers unintelligible random numbers to determine if you are dead or alive each day.

*You and the rest of the participants bring his or her partner to the game.*
	Excuse me?  This is worded as if you are playing a multiplayer game, is that on the forecast for updates to the game?  Its features like this that lead me to believe this is a early access title that is being marketed as a full release game.

*Each partner can use a unique ability which can be used to determine who are werewolves or protect yourself against their attacks.*
	While this is technically true, it is so poorly implemented.  Despite having abilities that should have saved me, I was still executed without reason or logic.  Sure you have abilities.  They don‚Äôt matter.  I will explain this a little later.

*You partner can become better at executing this ability as you win more battles.*
	This eludes to a leveling system in the game, where you can grow stronger/more powerful as the game progresses.  An hour into the game, and I can see absolutely no relevance to the ‚Äúcharacter level‚Äù at all.  Zero, none, nada, so either this feature is broken completely, or like many other gameplay mechanics, they don‚Äôt matter cause the AI can decide to arbitrarily kill you with no logic or reason.

*You are free to customize your partner‚Äôs character*
	These options are so limited they might as well not be there.  The developers descriptions keep eluding to a story, but there is nothing here.  Your choices for your partner don‚Äôt matter, and the partner itself does quite literally nothing.  What exactly is wrong with simply making the partner, your character?  It makes no sense, and amounts to nothing gameplay wise, or narrative wise.  Side note: Character voices sound like straight mumbling, and there are no English voice overs.  Even in Japanese the voice overs are snippits and unintelligible.

*You don‚Äôt know how the story runs every time you play, you can enjoy playing the unique game forever!*
	You don‚Äôt know the story cause there is no story.  You cannot claim there is a story, when you provide no interactable characters with unique personalities, no instances of communicative dialogue/decisions that have any impact, and no narrative reason for anything to happen.  The game is literally the same game each time, crafted as if the developers straight ripped off the rules from ‚ÄúAre you a werewolf‚Äù without ever playing the game to get inspiration.  

Those features amount to a general state of false advertisement in this game (including the trailer).  The game moves through the motions of the table top, but it leaves out all of the interactive story telling/narrative possibilities that simply interacting with characters would provide.   There are no characters in this game in its current state.  James, stein, marvin, etc etc, don‚Äôt matter.

You get to ask 1 of 4 questions each day.  The ‚Äúcharacters‚Äù will randomly provide no information, or an answer and all of the possibilities end there with no relevance.  Soon as the choice is made, random numbers are rolled and you get to find out if you die or not.
If you don‚Äôt die, you get to use an ability to your ‚Äúclass‚Äù, but after an hour of playing the game, I never got to use a single ability as ‚Äúknight‚Äù, ‚ÄúFortune teller‚Äù or ‚Äúpriest‚Äù.  Maybe it‚Äôs a random chance based on your level that your class will get to use the job?  Game gives no indicator, like all other aspects of the game, it literally gives you zero information about how to play, what things do, and when you can use them.  Even after an hour, amassing 44 coins, I was never able to use the shop which merits extra experience for classes.  The whole experience leaves me feeling like this game is not finished.

Even if the intent of designing this game was to straight rip off the board game in an effort to cash out, the developers managed to some how leave out 75 percent of what makes the board game it was based on fun.  (How the flip does that happen if you are interested in your craft?)

Don‚Äôt be a loser like me, don‚Äôt buy this game.   Its not worth the dollar asking price.
In closing, there is no story in this game.  There is no real gameplay in this game beyond straight random number generation.  There is no value in this game.   I would be curious to see if this game is still in development, and if it is, then get your shit properly represented devs.  Stop being dishonest, its not necessary, and you do have a possibly interesting title if you gave it some actual effort.

Yet again, another shitty werewolf title on steam.  Maybe one day I will stop buying these and temper my expectations from ‚Äúdesperate consumer‚Äù.",-0.08202603471295061
931120,Pixel Maze,game,False,"18 Sep, 2018","Casual, Indie","The game fills the color with a digital cue, all the numbers are interlocked, and each step must be patiently calculated to finally break the maze. If you like puzzle games, want to challenge difficult, and have a lot of time, come play!","give me more There's an absolutely massive amount of content for $1. If you're a fan of minesweeper/nonograms or similar logic-based puzzles then this is a great title to pick up.

There seems to be a save bug where if you save a puzzle, close the game, open it, and load the puzzle, then you won't be able to save the puzzle again properly. So you either finish it in the second session or lose your progress. The other reviews here seem to see that as a deal-breaker, but it's really not that hard to just finish a puzzle within two play sessions...It would be really nice if the developer had fixed it some time over the past year though.

I've almost finished the game and have yet to see any other bugs related to the saves or anything else. The UI is smooth and responsive, and I haven't had any issues with it either. [b]2024 edit:[/b] price went from $1 to $4 in october 2023, years after the game came out, but still no patches or fixes. despicable.

a very difficult fill-a-pix puzzler with color images. you get a blank canvas with a bunch of numbers and a 3x3 cursor, and you have to figure out which square gets which color. the result is a picture and a sense of accomplishment, as guessing is not necessary.

216 levels from 8x8 to 59x59, no timer, no ratings, zoom in/out, and it used to be unbelievably cheap even at full price until 2023, but that's all there was on the positive side, with several things outweighing it on the negative, unfortunately.

first of all, the game starts up in chinese, have to change it in the settings (unless you know chinese, of course), where you can't find any volume sliders, just on/off for music and sound, but since it was made in unity and the launcher is enabled, resolution options and windowed mode are available on startup.

there are a lot of typos, and it's got nothing to do with not being a native speaker, it just reeks of laziness when there are no spaces where they should be and half the level names start with capital letters while the rest don't. I posted a somewhat better english translation in the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1806310561]guides section[/url].

the worst thing and the major dealbreaker is how saving and loading works, or most of the time doesn't work. if you quit a level, [b]it doesn't save your progress, you have to do it manually[/b] to one of the 3 slots, which is something you can get used to, and at least there's more than one slot. if you want to continue, you can only do so by going back to the main menu and load ('read') that puzzle, because if you simply open it again from level select, it's gonna get reset.

this would all be tolerable, especially for such a low price and such a huge amount of content, except [b]saving and loading is buggy as hell[/b]. the only thing that works is the save getting deleted when you solve the level. you might be able to load your progress from the last session, but even then it's not sure if you can save it again. if you do each puzzle in one sitting, it's not an issue, but for some reason I find this game really difficult, and I normally do fine with nonograms and the like, so even a 15x15 level can take a considerable amount of time, and I have no idea how long (and with a limited amount of time, how many sessions) a 50x50 would take, but proper saving and loading is essential in any video game anyway.

there's a hint button that solves a 3x3 square, but it can only be used once per level (twice for bigger puzzles), though it resets if you load the level again (if you can, that is), so if you're really desperate, there are ways to get more hints.

and while it's not a huge deal for me, achievements are also iffy. I finished the first 3 pages, loaded the first level on page 4 and I still only had achievements for the first 2 chapters, 3 and 4 only got unlocked after reaching page 5.

as levels go by, their size increases, and while zoom is an option (and most welcome, especially when playing in windowed mode), moving the picture around easily is not. another huge oversight. there is a button that lets you cycle through incomplete numbers, so you can click that a few times, zoom in, etc. but it's awkward and there's no way to center the level after that at all.

I really wanted to recommend this game, but in such a broken state, and with only a single patch a few days after release, so no real chance of it ever getting fixed, I simply can't. I hope more similar games will come to steam eventually, there are a few link-a-pix titles, and of course plenty of nonogram/picross games, but nothing like this. Flipped my review after further playing. The underlying mechanic (basically fill-a-pix) is great, a step-by-step pure logic puzzler with lots of pretty colors. The interface, however, is a mess. The English translation desperately need a thorough edit; the color palette behaves in lots of odd and non-intuitive ways; it's far too linear; and the level save is not only clunky, but eats saves. 

I desperately wanted to make it work, as I love the mechanic and there's very few similar games on Steam, but after struggling to get through a bottleneck and then having two level saves eaten simultaneously, I give up.

Runs great on Steamplay (Mint 18.2, Nvidia proprietary), which is only good thing I can say about it and most of that credit goes to Unity3d.",0.0396304207488418

1051690,Nightmare Reaper,game,False,"28 Mar, 2022","Action, Indie",Progress through the cursed depths of a nightmare while finding an arsenal of powerful weapons and improving your abilities along the way. This retro-inspired FPS with looter shooter and rogue-lite elements breaches the wall between classic and modern gameplay.,"A game where you fight your inner demons-- literally.

Nightmare Reaper is a boomer shooter with rogue-lite progression. Every map is separated by three sequential levels, where you can collect gold and topaz for which can be spent minigames for permanent stat upgrades. Jade is the third currency, acquired through playing arenas. 

Hundreds of weapons, dozens of enemies and gallons of blood await in the depths of demon-infested caves, cities, mines, dockyards, prisons, ruins, and wherever else you may be needed for extermination.

The game's only 25 bucks but it definitely gives more than its money's worth in a bloody good time. Boom shoot good Yeah, it's pretty good.  You flush a toilet, turn the light switch a lot.  Um...I remember petting the dog and slaughtering hordes of demons with a bug gun.  Also grappling hooks.  And multiplayer is being worked on.  So that's neat.

Many secrets.  Good for long gaming sessions or short one off runs.  Unlockables are endless until they end. It's a Boomer Shooter, and a Roguelite! What is not to love? This game is amazing This game is awesome! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes boomer shooters and likes a lot of variety in weapons to choose from. I think this game is a hidden gem that deserves more attention. Nightmare Reaper is a must play for fans of boomer shooters, FPS, roguelites, or all of the above. This game sat in my library for so long unplayed, but the second I hopped in playing, I put in about 16 hours before playing anything else. Outside of running / controlling perfectly on steam deck, the game does exactly what it says on the box: provides a classic boomer shooter experience updated with modern game design elements such as loot drops and skill trees. I won't spoil anything, but the skill tree system in this game is incredibly smart and engaging, and the loot system is present but not impactful on gameplay in a negative way (i.e. there's no meta to follow or Destiny-esque power level grind, simply find some weapons you like, use them, rinse and repeat). Narrative is present and handled creatively, with small dripfeeds of story and exploration. All weapons come with alt-fires that change the way they can be used in combat, and enemies are varied to a point where it does impact the way and order in which you engage them.

I've played (and loved) games like Project Warlock and Forgive Me Father, but this game just got its hooks in me like no other game in its genre recently has. Definitely worth a few hours (or days) of your time! A celebration of all things retro with excellent sound design, kick-ass sound track and a compelling setting. 10/10 10/10 CLUTTER SIMULATOR I'm just going through a personal issue in life. And this game was helpful. REALLY.. helpful.

I got all the achievements cause this game is actually GREAT and addicting. The new game plus keeps you invested.

But my only complain is the 500 powerups achievements. NO WAY a sane person would spend that much time to get all this through normal ways. Aside from that, Great game. Great flow. Dev did a great job and Andrew too (with the badass music).",0.11004571817071818

The jumping is something I've seen complained about, and I completely understand why. This is one of those platformers where you need to time your jumps right, and watch what's above you, especially in level 4 when scaling up the wall. Failure is absolutely punishing. I can't complain about this, I'd rather my mistakes be my own fault so I can learn from it.

The brightness. Why the fuck is there not an option to turn it down? Only thing I have to say about that.

There's really not much else to it...This game is well...yeah...If you have 3$ to burn, might as well try it out.

I recommend this, but if you have sensitive eyes like I do, I don't. The brightness will strain your eyes.

https://youtu.be/y4_wZO2b90o

[h1]Review:[/h1]
Up front let me say that I don't totally dislike this game and I hope it improves, at which point I would love to switch this ""not recommended"" rating to ""recommended."" I think some of my issues below are even covered in the developer's post-release roadmap and I'm looking forward to seeing how that all goes.

Bottom line: At the moment, I don't think the game is particularly fun as a platformer.

The game has some good things going for it: some very pleasing visuals, very soothing music, and some low stress environments where you don't feel like you need to rush your platforming.

All that being said, the platforming levels themselves as well as the overall feeling of movement leave much to be desired. Jumping is very floaty and feels like you're gliding on the moon. Likewise general movement feels slightly like you're skating around, and also your momentum is hard to stop if you're trying to change direction in mid air. None of these things to me are issues individually, but combined it leads to a lot of situations where you're overshooting small platforms and falling either into a bottomless pit (where the game kindly sets you back more or less where you were when you fell), or far more punishing, you fall all the way down to the very base of a series of platforms you were slowly but surely making your way up.

Which is also part of the issue I think: a lot of the platforming is simply scaling a multitude of platforms to get to the top of something, be it to collect items needed to reach the exit, or to get to the exit itself. This is both not particularly interesting and feels severely punishing if you fall after climbing 30+ platforms only to have to do it all again.

There are some deviations to this formula, but they too I think could use some refinement. As an example, one puzzle has you picking up colored cubes and putting them on colored platforms which can only be reached by carrying the cube while hopping over platforms suspended over a bottomless pit. The issue here is the cube covers half your view. Ultimately it just makes platforming feel cheap and frustrating as it feels like the game blindfolded you rather than tested any actual measure of your platforming skill.

This was my general impression from all the stages I played. Again, the game looks nice and sounds nice, but handles not great and the platforming elements just weren't very exciting. And again, I'm hopeful the game improves. I think it has a lot of potential and I'd love to come back and relax with the game's soothing music and hopefully upgraded platforming.

I also wanted to mention -- though I'm confident this will get fixed pretty quickly -- I ran into a showstopping bug about 5 levels in where after falling into a bottomless pit, it respawned me somewhere without platforms, and thus I was stuck in an infinite loop of falling. Even restarting the game couldn't fix this. Again, I'm sure this'll get fixed fast, but worth noting until it does.",0.022525839793281648

From ZX Spectrum style loading screen to every aspect, pure retro, pixel perfect, done with heart and knowledge and it may look as a small game but it takes hours to complete the Campaign and if You like endless runners there is a second game mode - New School.

I like that all planets are based on real objects in space, so there`s even some educational aspect.
Every stage and enemies are different, some deeper into the game are crazy - my faroite is the one with the weapon ""mulfunction"" :) - mini-games, leaderboards and huge replayability.
Very intense, high paces shooter-platformer.

And my favorite - Co-Operative mode on one screen.
Reminds me good old days of arcade gaming. Best for parties.

It should be more popular, especially with that price, You won`t be sorry.
I recommend Jet Set Corps. TAU CETI E is my favorite level.
Game is difficult, requires learning patterns on each planet, coordination and arcade skills. Well done!

It`s surprising, not a small game You can expect from ZX Spectrum retro games, it has a lot of features, story, and high replayability.

What You get:
- Story mode (Old School) and Endless Runner mode (New School), even mini-game between levels.
- A lot of real planets, which is cool and adds to the realism to the story :)
- Co-Op for 2 Players! Great feature.
- Every planet and enemies are unique, so it`s engaging,
- Lots of guns! :)
- Special pickups like Hologram that helps gathering resources and Colonists - very useful!
- Art is very nice - modernized a little but with respect for ZX Spectrum,
- Cool sounds - auto-turret, shotgun and enemies juicy ""splash"" :)
- Replay value - You can come back just to play one level or try to beat High Scores in endless.
- Leaderboards - scores from other Players You to beat
Fun!

Downsides - Some gameplay music would be nice. But at the other hand it`s true to the original platform where music in gameplay was rare. Maybe in Jet Set Willy :)

Generally a great retro game with great attention to details. Lots of real planets with descriptions is a valuable addition. Two game modes possible - adventure and casual, co-op (!), fast arcade shooter.
I recommend it. [list][*][b][h1]Morlan's shorts:[/h1][/b][/list]
An obvious homage to the [b]ZX Spectrum[/b] era ..a borrowed, ahem, idea from ""JetPac"" (you could say rip-off, if in a bad mood) from 1983. It is basically the same gameplay where your jetman dude (choice for a dudette) is assembling his ship, collects fuel and lifts off. Added ideas: change extra weapons/add bombs/timer and a ""newschool"" mode that is an horizontal scroller (one way) where you still collect stuff etc but you constantly jetpack your way through baddies (same variety) and items.
[b]Some issues need addressing[/b]:
1. First of all don't make speeded up videos for your game. It's deceiving, irritating to the eye and doesn't give the correct idea of what the gameplay looks like.
2. The flying is heavy, slowish/sluggish and the gravity too strong, compared to how the meanies are moving.
3. The hitbox is fairly large making it easy to get hit even if it feels you weren't that close.
4. The sound effects are rough and not very pleasing to the ear. In particular the ""whang-whang"" sound in the menu and the laser, and..
5. ..DROP THE CAPITALS people. What is up with capitalised game names? There's no point to ""stand out"" because half the games come out in CAPITALS.. it's ANNOYING.. STOP IT. (See what I did there? ). Not even angry, just making a point. And it isn't 80s style. They had small letters back then too. And yes there were also capitalized name games too, idiotic trends aren't a new thing.
6. Too high a price for the experience. Find it at 2 gold coins or less and it's alright..

..which is the reason I, not wholehearedly, recommend but I'm partial to the retro-game genre and I don't have a problem with ""pixel-art"" like some others..
[b]Some fun to be had, more so if you're nostalgic about the era, but it's kind of a one-off. You come, you play, you go..[/b]

EDIT: [b]I am changing the review to negative because of the translations[/b]. You [b]NEED[/b] to use proper translators, i.e. people, to translate your game. Don't be lazy, cheap, because really bad machine translations are an insult to the languages. There may be others but least one language, namely Greek, is really an abomination of translation and an insult  to the language. [b]FIX IT[/b] and I will review and change my opinion accordingly.

[b]Don't waste more time reading lengthy reviews.. time is of the essence![/b] Jet Pack with new levels and modes and same retro feel. Sexy game, very nostalgic, bonus with co-op! An excellent remake of the classic arcade game with nice gameplay. Some of the levels are really chellenging. I recommend to all fans of retro gaming. Memories of ZX Spectrum and Atari ..... very good playability! It is a nice ZXS color style game , smooth movement with colorful screen , funny control with ship parts collection , this game reminds me of the < Soft ÔºÜ Cuddly >1987 . I like the game , but I think some change will be better .
1 . Add some BGMs in game , when I played I feel lonely and empty .
2 . Add more acts . The spaceman and aliens kind of doll . They just fly around .
3 . It is cool the ship needs food , not only apple , Canned vegetable and Canned meat also yummy .
4 . This game need a strong theme , horror or funny .
5 . This game speed is fast , make it slow and stressful . Maybe one scary alien chased spaceman .
Then we got : A spaceman in different maps save people and find ship parts with limited ammo and a scary alien try to chased him , add some creepy music / Blood / Dead body / cult 
Ok~ here my crazy suggestions , anyway I hope your games be popular and better .

Happy new year in 2023 and really expect 3D vision haha",0.07970042507693108

I played some game where I wished they would take longer....well Skyfall isn't one of them!
The game is ...there is no other word for it...boring.
Because items are rare and costly the usual gameplay is like this: going to the next dungeon, fighting 2 - 3 mobs.
Than back to the base with a free bed. Of course that is only if you played this on normal or hard...with difficult easy you can probably fight 4 mobs 

Don't waste your money on this one.

edit: and before you ask, I played this game offline so my real playtime is near 3 hours. I do recommend this game because I had a lot of fun playing it.  Scenery is good to look at and character portraits are well done.

BUT - I started the game in Normal difficulty, which I always do with RPGs.  Got to the first boss fight against orcs and I couldn't beat them at all.  The enemies don't respawn, so you can't go back and level up.  So I started the game again - this time in Easy mode.  No problems with the fights then!

I like the 3 separate teams you start off with, so they have different stories.

There are secret rooms to find which give good treasure/equipment.

I would recommend buying the guide (it's very cheap on Steam).  The guide shows secret room locations and also side quests which help levelling up a lot.  What I would like to see in the guide is a world map - I spent quite a while sailing round lost.

 great game good story line A cute little classic RPG.  Super easy mouse controls.  Fun game play.  Lack of a map and quest tracking takes a little bit away from it, sometimes you spend more time running around trying to figure out what to next than actually playing the game.  Overall a fun but frustrating game. Maps, actors (with the same default name) are default templates provided with RPG maker MV software, no map was designed from scratch. It¬¥s a sideview battle.

Game story boring. Just finish the game in 5 hrs.

IT¬¥S NOT WORTHY. I prefer aveyond. this is a great game - a lot of thought has gone into the concept- using 3 parties each with their own story is a great idea coming together as needed- great artwork and graphics- scenery and story are both acceptable and having a guide is another great help. some battles are quite hard but that is to be expected as with the ending. this is one of the better games I have played - would definitely recommend for rpg players",0.04867857142857144
2230220,Wilderless,game,False,"9 Jan, 2023","Indie, Simulation, Early Access","Wilderless is a walking/hiking/photography simulator set in a fantasy wilderness. Players can explore a beautiful, procedurally generated natural open world. Tons of options allow you to configure many aspects of the world, and you can choose your initial world seed to generate different worlds.","The game is described as: ""Explore a Massive Procedurally Generated Open World Wilderness."" Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt find much of the ""explore"" part in it. The procedurally generated open world is indeed present, and the terrain generation works quite well. Exploring the world could have been interesting, but the keyboard-and-mouse controls, along with the HUD, are so poorly implemented that it‚Äôs impossible to engage with the experience. As a result, it‚Äôs hard to treat Wilderness as a proper game.
[olist]
[*]The camera has strange, restrictive movement.
[*]In bird flight mode, turning is jerky, and moving forward requires spamming the Space key, which is far from smooth.
[*]On-screen buttons frequently fail to respond to clicks.
[*]The interface sometimes switches to what seems to be a touch-screen layout, caused Esc and other inputs unresponsive and forcing me to quit with Alt+F4.
[*]The game runs poorly on my RTX 3060 even on low graphics settings.
[/olist]
This is not a game‚Äîit‚Äôs a project showcasing the creator‚Äôs procedural generation skills. However, due to the major issues with camera and controls, the promised ""go anywhere, anytime"" experience is out of reach, so I have to leave a negative review. I was left with a strong feeling that the game is mocking me‚Äîoffering a beautiful world while deliberately preventing me from exploring it with what feels like intentionally broken controls. A cute and relaxing walking simulator type game where you can just aimlessly explore a generated fantasy world. The game is in an early state and it shows in the funky animations, graphics, and collision detection, but I also see plenty of promise. My main gripes so far are with the UI, which feels optimised for mobile touch controls rather than mouse and keyboard. Overall, it's the kind of game you jump into when you don't want to use your tired head at the end of a long day and just want to chill, and I really like that. a little buggy but a beautiful relaxing game of casual exploration
 You can play as a dragon! 10/10 great game. This is more a virtual environment than a game right now, which is fine by me! I like cozy games and this right now is definitely one. You can walk around the world and collect objects which can be given to various animals who will then let you ride them. There are even pirate ships! Arr! its kinda fun. you can make a world of your liking Thumbs Up for amazing work for a single creator and good use of music in game.

But, 
Movement can be off with either keyboard/xbox controller with using Eagle or Ride on
Objects loading in Dungeons or can be mismatched and randomly sticking out of the wall, floor, water, ceiling....
Couple of times I had teleported on top of the dungeon/sewers yet still underground.
Objective: is there any? No Story? Meeting up with Dragon? Other than collecting flowers, mechanical bits and poo to ride on beasts... I see there is no purpose within the game. 
Glitches: Fast Travel is the worst, but glitches are everywhere... 
For now after lazily wandering around in zen, I am already bored and want to play something else that won't bug out on me.
 Really love my experience with it, is a unique concept and the art is really amazing, there's a good wholesome vibe about it that haven't found in other games!

100% would recommend. Not my normal type of game and generally not a normal type of game but I find that I enjoy it. It's similar to a game I love that I always have kept installed called FUGL (bird). Anyway the environment is very passive and the music is relaxing and it seems like the only current goal in EARLY ACCESS has been to collect spells and ride/pet the animals. It's really cute. I hope it gains traction so devs build an even greater experience. So far my favorite activity has been to ride the dragon which you can do by feeding it. There is nothing to kill and nothing seems to be able to kill you. The most difficulty I had was in the dungeon which was really not difficult. I purposely jumped into the lava to see if I'd die (the double jump and glide trivialize these simple trials), and you don't even after seventeen times. You vanish before you touch the lava and a red ball transports you to the last ledge. I wish more games let you just enjoy them this way. My biggest issue is with navigating the simple menu and graphic modifiers. I can't seem to follow a consistent graphic setting which is odd but then again, my machine is very dated and maybe the options are working flawlessly with an inept monkey (me) behind the controls. One example is that I somehow changed my head to a male head and then back to a female head but upon reentering the menu I can never change it to a male face/head again. The option has simply vanished.

I recommend this but please be respectful to the devs, as this early access title is still in the works.

(I love to spawn a shelter which can be anything from a covered wagon or a fully furnished house. lmao there are so many) Wilderless delivers an adorable art style in a small download.

[i]These are all reskins of exactly the same game![/i]  What value is there in this spam/pollution glutting the Steam store for gamers?

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics. 

This looks and feels like a mobile app, but it doesn't seem to have made it to the app stores.  It's unclear why this was put on Steam instead of the app stores it seems to have been designed for.  Maybe it was removed, maybe it was rejected by Apple and Google (they do have more rigorous quality standards than Valve does for Steam, after all).

Regardless, for all intents and purposes this might as well be a mobile app, it has the same limitations and dumbed down qualities.  It's impossible to recommend such a game to PC gamers.  We don't spend all this money building gaming rigs so we can pretend they're iPhones and play games that might as well be mobile apps.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 5 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

""1001 Jigsaw. World Tour: London"" has the farcical price of around $5 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam. This publisher 8floor managed to arranged 1 card game and then copy-paste it with different sfx, wallpapers and made 200+ games. ++  Lot of customization, number of pieces, regularity of pieces, rotated pieces
++  Clasical pieces
++  Nice and lot of pictures
-?   Probably bit better snapping, i mean some option to make it easier, piece must be placed quite precisely. Just small thing on that puzzle serie beauty. fun little jigsaw puizzles it is worth a sale i did get it on discount Have to agree with the original reviewer. Most of this publisher's puzzle sets are pretty good. They do sometimes reuse music from set to set (this shares music with at least the America set) and a few of the included photos are odd. Yes, I suppose you could see University grads in London, but it's not a thing tourists would usually be looking for.

Overall, it includes all the bells and whistles I like. Puzzles can be made to have more or less pieces, you're free to have a ghost image under the puzzle or the photo itself. That can even be resized. Magnifying glass, and pieces can lock down. Sparkles on the cursor, 500 puzzles with a nice mix of animals, scenery and food along with a scattering of other things. 

Some photos are quite pretty, some seem a little bit like filler, but you should find quite a few you like.I'd say pick it up on sale and realize it is London and has a lot of highlights of the city, but if you were thinking of specific stores or musicals it won't include that. Though, to be fair, there are plenty of corgis and cats. I do recommend this game for those who like virtual jigsaw puzzles.  I enjoy how this company's jigsaw puzzles work.  I like being able to push a button and sort out the border pieces (you just have to start with the border).  I like having the ghost image to place pieces on top of  when I need it and I like being able to choose how many pieces there are in the puzzle.  And I got it on sale which is always a good thing.  Not sure how some of the pictures relate to London but its all good.",0.07620345646046581

1079830,Cris Tales,game,False,"20 Jul, 2021","Action, Adventure, RPG","Cris Tales is a gorgeous, indie love letter to classic JRPGs with a new perspective. Peer into the past, act in the present, and watch as your choices dynamically change the future -- all on one screen as you play!","If Cris Tales is a love letter to Classic Jrpgs, then i hope it got rejected. I think I'd only recommend Cristales for people new to the JRPG/turn-based RPG genre - it's very straightforward as an introduction to that type of game, and it'll likely be enjoyable without being too difficult or frustrating. If you want something gorgeous to look at but not super stressful or difficult, I'm sure you'll have a good time.

Overall I'd say Cristales shines brightly in terms of the art style, concept, and music to an extent, but the execution really left some things to be desired. First and foremost I felt that the core fighting mechanic was underwhelming, and the time-manipulation specifically was a bit of a miss. Since only Crisbell can do the time shift and it uses up your turn, the entire process feels clunky and requires a good deal of set up to pull off. The results are also unimpressive, especially during boss fights. A large number of enemies (bosses and otherwise) are completely immune to statuses, which all but nullifies the effectiveness of the time manipulation. All in all I felt like it was more gimmicky than actually necessary to the combat, which is a shame because it's a very unique idea. 

Story-wise I'd continue the theme of good concept but lackluster execution. The skeleton of an excellent story is there and it is intriguing, but there's not enough interaction with the world and NPCs to really flesh it out. Most of the game felt like the story was on rails and you only got to take a few steps from the track. I was really left wanting more in that area; I could see the tip of the iceberg and wanted to dive all the way to the bottom. I'm not exaggerating when I say they could have tripled the amount of side-quests and character interactions if they wanted to. This also meant that a lot of the main characters unfortunately felt pretty one-dimensional. We get glimpses of back story, but nothing that doesn't serve The Plot. Something akin to loyalty missions would have really helped in that area, especially since there are characters that are not unlocked until very late in the game. 

Finally I have to mention some general quality of life and bug issues. I won't get into details, but I think Cristales would have greatly benefited with more play testing just to sus out minor QOL changes that would make the game feel less clunky. There are also a few bugs here and there, the most egregious of which is when, for one particular area, the game warns you of a ""point of no return"", but the warning comes AFTER YOU ALREADY PASSED THE POINT OF NO RETURN!!! This means that once you see that warning, you are already locked out all the side quests in that area if you hadn't completed them, and it is completely unforgivable that they did not catch it in play testing. Thank goodness I don't worry about 100%ing achievements...

It probably sounds like I'm crapping all over this game, but to be clear I really did enjoy playing it. It's gorgeous, it's easy to pick up and learn, the world is unique and interesting, and every once in a while you can set up a very satisfying combat combo. It's also worth mentioning that the voice acting is excellent! The VAs all did a bang-up job and sounded wonderful! All that being said, I'm hoping that the Cristales team keeps up the good work and is able to learn some lessons that can be applied to their future projects. I'm definitely going to keep an eye out for new stuff from this team. TL;DR - The combat, puzzles and choices you make don't change or improve past what you get chapter, sometimes getting worse. It doesn't utilise its main mechanic well, discouraging it's use in combat the further you get.
Only selling point is it concept and good artwork

This... is a game that I really, REALLY wanted to like... but I just can't.
The moment I got through the start of the game, I was looking forward to how the combat could evolve, puzzles and seeing how your choices could effect the story you're being told, deciding what is right and whats wrong.

Unfortunately, even with my expectations being set to be a small expansion to what was shown... it wasn't.
Combat? Apart from being mainly tied to a single character mechanic and one other character singular skill... the time based part of it is not used well. In fact, your even punished for attempting it sometimes or prevented from using it all together... so whats the point in it if I have basically seen everything from the moment ""chapter 1"" starts. Doesn't help when you can also just win easily by have a single character carry with physical or magic damage extremely easily without ever using the time mechanic.

Puzzles? They expand on it slightly with restoring or decaying objects to progress... but sometimes this is used to just add slight padding... or to go ""What was the point in that?"" For example, you go across a suspended walk way, it collapses on you, you walk back up in ten seconds to restore it and proceed as if nothing happened.

Choices? This was the big part for me, since its constantly has the main character wonder if this was the right choice, and that choices will have consequences and you have to make what you believe is the best decision.

Only for the game to basically lie about that by having you get a third option if you do all of an areas sidequest where it basically gives you the best outcome with 0 consequences to the story... and the characters still wonder if it was the right choice when the main character literally sees everything is good now. On top of that, story wise, getting the third option for doing all the sidequests doesn't even make sense as some of them have 0 connection to why the third choice would exist.

I get it, bonus for players for going out of their way to do all the other content first, but you cant have the best option for deciding which thing to save be gate locked by helping with a float and fixing a romance which has 0 connection to the getting the third option to appear.

The only thing that has kept me going is HOPING the game gets better. But im 90% sure im about to finish the second to last part, and only one new thing has been introduced for puzzles and barely adds anything to it.
Im unfortunately extremely disappointing in this game, there's even more things that has frustrated me... but this review is already long enough, so I'll leave it at that. Just a really good story. Made me sad, happy and angry at times. Loved it. Absolutely beautiful art and design. Pretty decent game-play and a captivating story/world.

Also cute talking frog. 

There are a few moments where dialogue does not match text, but that's rare and does not detract from the game-play. 

 I admit I don't have too much experience or interest in RPGs but I had a lot of fun with this one both for the gameplay, and characters and story!

I liked it from early on but waited to finish it to leave a proper view and I can't say it lost my interest ever! The different strategies you can use with the different combinations of the characters is really fun. I loved exploring the world and the characters were so cute! The art style was very pretty and what caught my attention in the first place. It being fully voiced also a nice luxury, features some of my favorite actors too!

I def think it's worthy of a try! I was lucky enough to get it while it was on sale but I think it's well worth it's full price. i wanted to play this for so long because of the demo + trailers. but i give up right near the end LOL i can't deal with this game anymore. ended up watching the ending on utube

btw literally ripped the plot straight from bravely default. at least bravely did it well though

pros:
art style is beautiful. some fun dialogue, characters and story are OK but not horrible

cons:
- genuinely some of the worst boss battle designs i've ever seen in a video game. they're not even hard, they just take ten years especially in late game bc bosses keep regening and you don't do any damage despite maxing out weapons etc. also i feel like you'd genuinely be stuck on these bosses if you didn't look up what to do, because there's pretty much only one way to beat them and if you slightly mess it up... wellll have fun with another ten years working to beat it. 
- game is so slow. no sprint option while walking??
- introduces a cool time mechanic! (then proceeds to do nothing with it)
- like i said before characters just constantly feel so weak and half ur moves feel like they do nothing
- buggy animations

yeah idk try the game on sale if ur a fan of jrpgs, but don't expect perfection. i think the game had a lot of potential but i'm just really disappointed.  - Good art style
 - Underutilized main selling point
 - Boring combat
 - Shit story I put this game on my wish list a long time ago and was scared off by the mixed reviews.
Now that I played it, I think it's pretty good. Not $40 good, but still good.

Every single dialogue is voiced. Every. Single. One. Even for the smallest and most insignificant NPC. This is amazing for a small game like this. And all the voice talents do an amazing job.
Even though it is annoying at times when you're asked for the trillionth time ""Do you wish to land here?""

The characters are good and the banter between them makes the game feel more alive. Willhelm necking Christopher or Zas casually speaking out loud what you think in front of your screen is just amazing. Cris herself is a little bit bland, but grows with her adventure.

The story itself is... okay. While nothing spectacular, it okay in its own right. It doesn't help that the whole story revolves around time, and there are only a handful of good time traveling stories in this world.

The game mechanics of each character are unique enough to try them, even though there is only one VIP in your group who will kill most enemies in one turn. Cris' whole mechanic with time shifting is interesting, but irrelevant for most enemies and even bosses later on, which is a shame.
The town riddles regarding time travel, while interesting in theory, are pretty easy and in almost all cases you are told exactly what you """"could"""" do to proceed, which is exactly what you should do.

The OST is pretty good as well, some outstanding battle tracks are included.

So in short: If you want a short, small game with a unique experience, even if it is not the best out there, get this game on sale and have a good time :)


Final warning for completionist: Some achievements require reloading saves, one or two may be bugged. If you want to 100% this game, check a walkthrough beforehand. I recommend this game if you find it interesting or intriguing from the trailers, images, and/or content about it online. I'd get it on a discount just to experience the art. 

It's a very 'basic' game, but it does the basics competently enough and the new stuff is does try are good. Visually it's amazing. I spent a couple of hours just looking it at, traveling to each timeline to see how the art, world and characters change. It does the concept of time travel or seeing past/future really well, there's no overcomplication that can come from dabbling in this topic. 

The combat is alright. It isn't hard as some people make it up to be. The enemies are pretty simple once you get to learn them, and there's a small level of strategy with what moves to use and how to use the time abilities. I did a small amount of grinding and fought every battle I encountered and I managed just fine. 

The story and plot isn't anything to right home about. The writing in these kinda games can be an advantage but in this game they played it pretty safe, tho the voice acting is competent and can be really good at times. There's 1 small section at the end of the game that really surprised me in that it tackled a pretty heavy topic/story point and the voice acting for the NPC involved was top notch. 

Cons for the game are random encounters which some people can dislike. The plot was kinda whatever near the end, and it relies too much on going back to old areas to do stuff and fight similar enemies to ones you fought. There's 2 such sequences in the game and it really hurt the pacing, feels like it's just padding. Enemy design is also very limited, a lot of them, especially bosses, get reused. The game is short enough that it's not that big of a deal. You also move kinda slowly in the world and you do a lotta walking so the slowness really shows. 

There's a sidequest that's easily missable if you don't immediately go and get it, ruining your true ending/100% run.",0.13474985927385325

For those who follow, let it be known that riding atop the backs of swine is excellent transportation. For our victory would not have been possible without the swine slopes. Graphics are ok, idea of the game is great too but you realize pretty quick that it isn't balanced that well. We managed to get past Wave 2 but it wasn't fun at all. The rats are always running towards the gate and not attacking the player. Also I didn't get any heal items or gold so I couldn't purchase something for progressing.
Not a terrible game but needs a lot of work to be enjoyable. no garbage game not worth the 2 dollars i got it for (was 50% off) The main menu look's ok, the non-boss enemies need tweaking like for example the vampires sometimes get stuck after jumping and sometimes they get stuck just on principle. The Bosses, like the skeleton mage is a badass and chases you funny same with the melee attack, The monster giant rats are annoying with the dodging and jumping and the poison, The skull zombie boss is ok, The black witch is just bad on the fact that when her health gets low enough she will go full nude and go's absolutely crazy on you with her semi medium range claw attacks and she is butt ugly in every way imaginable,
The demon bat is annoying the fact that it spits poison projectiles at you, flys and sometimes building to building creating this annoying sound,the Spider Queen is ok, but from a single player perspective the web projectile attack is quite irritating 
because you can't get out of it unless the duration expires or she kills you, now the furious werewolf likes to jump a lot, the forest troll is bit of a brutal boss because it throws these high damaging rocks at you apart from that
the boss is alright, now orc commander boss is a bit overpowered in the way that while engaging you, even if you created a lot of distance between you and the boss it teleports close you and starts whaling at you with he's weapon, 
now finally the elder forest dragon is going to be the irritating boss in the game because 1st it can spit fireballs directly behind it Self and 2nd the fire breath ability is so strong that if you don't have the strongest shield you will die
especially when your in melee range and 3rdly the fire breath attack can go through buildings. Now the weapons like axe feels under-powered, the sword feels strong, the spear feels a bit ok but it go's through stamina so quick even after
you drink the stamina potion it feels so stamina intensive to use long term and the crossbow is under-powered with the normal arrows (90), the fire arrows is average (50) and the explosive arrows are a bit good but you only have (35) of these at a time making the arrows feel wasteful to buy, fire bombs and poison bombs feel under-powered consider you can get the maximum of 3 while the healing bombs are good to buy, pig bait is ok, kamikaze dwarf is genius, pike barricades are ok, explosive barrels feel compulsory to use especially in horde 2 through your 1st and or 2nd attempt or (etc) to pass the level as the giant rats are way tougher then the zombies, the armour diversity is ok, there's No pause feature while in game the looting is so slow that you only have roughly 2 secs to loot as your kill as there is no take all feature in the looting tab, back to the monster giant rat boss that while inside the building closest to the gate if you go to the right corner when you get attacked without blocking you will phase through the wall and end up on the other side the gate so you can get free loot without the 1st gate falling, people are most likely wandering how i finished the game the elder forest dragon get stuck on the roof of the building closest to the 4th gate and i conveniently have a catapult with unlimited ammo witch BTW the wheels act like car wheels and does small damage to the dragon, the ballista also has unlimited ammo. Despite this review there is definitely potential for this game like in multiple playthroughs i keep seeing these blue bottles that i can only assume are mana bottle that could possibly mean players can use magic in the future witch would be cool for the game. I played the game solo just FYI. The boss music is badass. easily the greatest release of 2022, although wave 2 is near impossible there is so many rats don't buy this game its terrible
thanks  I like the graphics and the idea of the game, for the price it worth to play it, i think is a great start to a game. Of course it needs a lot of more work, but i see potential on this.",0.031242711370262397

Well nope. As much as I wanted to play this unique-looking game it quickly went from ""unpolished"" to downright unplayable. First and foremost this game does have gameplay (as in you do move and fight) and that's where it went wrong for me. It crashed, it lagged, it froze which ruined the atmosphere and just made the whole experience not worth it. Boring, tedious game that tries to be deep. It has shallow characters and there's barely a story. Buy it if you like holding the arrow key down for fifteen minutes at a time listening to pointless exposition and tapping the z key when you hear a sound (which is this game's version of combat.) OH and if you mess up a fight, enjoy holding the arrow key down for fifteen more minutes, listening to the same repeated pointless exposition so you can retry it. A neat little storytelling experience held back by clunky controls and low rez art.  Gameplay elements of  ‚Äúmoving forward‚Äù, fight or flight choices,  and there is a bit of timing with sword swings.  Problem is, they are so low effort  that it detract from the overall experience.  The voice-over was nice. 
This would make a good  visual novel with the gamey bits stripped out. 
 I guess I'm playing a very different game to others because I found this game underwhelming, cliche and overtly sexist. I don't think I've ever written a negative review for a game before but I'm genuinely not sure how the developers justify it's existence.

The premise is that you must slay the beautiful ice maiden who captures the hearts of young men in order to curse the village with eternal winter, due to her irrational emotions at her love leaving. To do so, you must gather the swords of noble warriors who (to use the game's own words) died pitifully at the hands of a woman. So shameful! 

It's an incel wet dream complete with stereotypical Japanese tropes and a very basic battle system. I appreciate it was made in RPG Maker and wasn't expecting much graphics-wise but from the many positive reviews, I was expecting a game with a lot more substance than I was presented with. The walking is tedious, the battles repetitive. Don't get me started on the pointless 'Talk' feature which could have been developed into something charming/quirky but widely misses the mark. 

The only good point I can credit this game with is an atmospheric quality. The soundtrack, predominantly monochrome style and Japanese audio track complement each other nicely. Visual Novel where you lead Yukiji on a journey of vengeance, to the snowy mountain where Yukie resides.
Great story with beautiful art and good voice acting and music.
The combat is simple and interesting but gets some hard fights towards the end.
The story is short (around 2-3h) but i'd definitely recommend it. Definitely some frustration here (game seems a little too long given that the majority of your input is just pressing the left arrow to walk, or walk faster, and some input in combat was ignored).",-0.01254027342389412

It‚Äôs basically more of the same: you‚Äôre still a shark, still eating everything in sight, and still leveling up. The new story is a bit wacky with some conspiracy theory vibes, and there‚Äôs a few new areas to explore, but it doesn‚Äôt really do anything groundbreaking.

Overall, if you loved Maneater, you‚Äôll have a good time with Truth Quest, but don‚Äôt expect it to reinvent the wheel. It‚Äôs a solid addition to an already entertaining game, but it doesn‚Äôt go beyond that. Worst DLC i have ever played. And i have played a lot of Ubisoft and EA games so that says something. Become the God of the Sea The game is great when it runs; ever since playing the dlc the game actually runs far worse. Fun dlc but horribly optimized. This DLC for Maneater is not as good as the main game, but it is fun and I would recommend playing Maneaster: Truth Quest.
 unreasonable difficulty spike. if not for the achievement i would never bother buying this It's just a DLC not an expansion, nerds It makes the game run even worse, especially during the human eating missions (which there are way too many of). It crashes way too often, do not buy. Truth Quest is very much more of the same; another area with its own collectables, as well as a few new things for the other areas, a few new evolutionary mutations, a new type of objective in the time trials that see you swimming and flying through rings (which i especially loved, it's a shame there's no way to replay them), and a few other things.

Most notably, however, is that this DLC is more difficult than the base game. While at max level in the base game you can reliably tear apart anything you come across, here you can have fully maxed level and mutations and still have trouble with the bosses. They come at you with far more than what base game offers and the battles can get quite chaotic and intense! Even the hunted wildlife, that now [spoiler] have some of your mutations [/spoiler] can be more of a challenge. It never feels unfair though; you just need a good grasp of the techniques, know when to retreat, etc.

I really enjoyed it and definitely recommend it, especially if you're looking for a bit more content or challenge on the base game. However, if you're not up for a challenge you might not enjoy it quite as much. And for anyone wondering, this very much feels more like a DLC that was made as a complete afterthought to the base game, not one of those where they've obviously held back a part of the base game to be DLC.

Also there was something about conspiracy theory or something but i wasn't really listening.",0.019078130704636726

In the digital realm, I was a kingpin, orchestrating deals, outmaneuvering rivals, and amassing virtual wealth with ease. But it wasn't until financial hardship knocked at my door that I realized the potential of my skills beyond the confines of the screen.

With bills piling up and desperation gnawing at my resolve, I made a daring decision. Armed with the knowledge and tactics honed in the virtual world, I ventured into the dangerous underworld of drug trafficking. It was a leap into the unknown, fueled by equal parts desperation and determination.

To my surprise, my virtual expertise translated seamlessly into the real world. I navigated the murky waters of the illicit drug trade with the finesse of a seasoned pro, leveraging my knowledge to secure deals, evade law enforcement, and outwit competitors.

As the profits rolled in, so did the risks. But with each hurdle I overcame, my confidence swelled, and my empire expanded. What started as a gamble born out of necessity soon blossomed into a lucrative enterprise, making me richer than I ever dared to dream.

Fight your way from left to right and leave no face unpunched! Four characters, 13 levels, a survival mode and a ton of fun awaits you!","I saw Battle Forever at a cheap price a few months back, but held off on it until today. The forums are bare, and a couple of the reviews seem rather harsh. Surely the game can't be that bad.

Truth is, it isn't. However it isn't a great game either. You can tell a lot of passion went into it, as the graphics and sound, while not exceptional, do their job well enough. Considering one guy did it in maybe five months, it's pretty impressive honestly.

The gameplay itself is rather simple, but it is a beat 'em up so they are supposed to be simple. You move from left to right, beating up groups of enemies that come in five types with a combo, a heavy move, or a special move that you can constantly recharge and use over and over again. Along the way you fight several bosses, including 'The Bleeder' who sprays slime everywhere, 'Mike' (no seriously that's his name) who makes clones of himself, and the big bad, Professor S, the most evil of all scientists, who...randomly drops copy machines that shoot paper airplanes at you?

The story is clearly a bit tongue in cheek as you can't take it totally seriously. But that's fine, you don't come to this sort of game for a story. With that being said, one playthrough of this game will take you less then an hour. But there are four characters and a handful of achievements so you're gonna get about four, or maybe five hours, on a $2.00 (Canadian) purchase. That's not too bad for a game like this. You certainly won't be battling forever, but you'll get enough enjoyment out of it for your money.

An easy to play, time killing, not-quite-forever lasting recommendation. I was excited by the look of this game as back in the 90s I played the likes of Vigilante , Double Dragon and many other like these.

The gameplay  however is simply terrible. Controls, gameflow/sprites/scrolling and enemey AI just ruins everything. 

I cannot recommend this game to anyone. :-( Just asked for a refund. The free game this rips off, little fighter 2 (lf2.net), is 100 times better than this piece of crap.

lf2 has more characters, more special moves and smoother controls (imagaine that huh? an old a** game like lf2 has smoother controls than this crap).

A fun little advance wars clone with well designed maps and a reasonable price. If you don't mind the graphics, it's definitely worth a buy.

I also love the boss units in the ""Battle for Liberstadt"" maps. They bring something unique to the table while not overstaying their welcome. OK, I didn't go deep into the game, I knew of all the mediocre stuff... BUT NO GRID??? How am I supposed to quickly count enemy ranges??? On one hand, I can't say the game was bad; some of the unit designs I thought were pretty good (namely the diesels), and the music is okay-ish. The faction-specific upgrades are also pretty nice, though there really should have been some better attempt at icon variety. 

On the other hand, I can't say I liked the campaign's story. The ending was lackluster imo; basically a worse variation of Iron Harvest's series of events (the last mission as a whole is the biggest offender of the bunch). 

The backdrops are...not very good in my opinion. Very dull palette, would really benefit from maybe grasslands or snowy terrain.

Character design was inconsistent for Blue League. I don't know why. All I know is we've got joan of arc, mechanic, and historically appropriate military CO for that faction. At least the Black Empire's ensemble have a consistent uniform of sorts. 

Really the game is just ""okay"". I wanted to like it but in the end I wasn't very invested in the game's story or general feel. Clearly there WAS an attempt at making an Advance Wars-esque game, but there's just a lot of things I felt should have been done better, most especially the ending for the game.

5/10 Game. Not terrible. Not really that interesting though. This feels like a romhack, and I mean that in a good way. A lot of care was taken in tinkering with the mechanics without changing the overall formula, and the result is an Advance Wars that's less spiky and wild, but still highly playable.

For all the custom art poured into Wargroove, I didn't really click with its mechanics and gamefeel. But this I like.

Some changes include:
-no fuel management, only ammo
-veterancy, giving you benefits for keeping a unit alive for a couple turns
-temporary customization points to spend before missions, letting you tailor your strategy instead of being forced into a particular CO's playstyle
-a lot of CO powers have been scaled back or given a secondary effect, and you pick a power from a list rather than just activating based on your star level (no iconic sami/eagle blitz, and the AoEs are less destructive, but the overall toolkit is wider)

In terms of writing, it doesn't seem to be Empires' primary focus, but I didn't mind Days Of Ruin and I don't mind this.

For a small team making a labor of love, this is a pretty big swing. And if you liked the feeling of just regular combat in Advance Wars, endure through the tutorial and get to the real stages. They're worth it.

Edit: Cleared the first real campaign. My opinion is basically unchanged. The tutorial campaign filters a lot of people, and I think this is a shame. The stages in the real campaign are solidly designed. Nothing too special, but they feel like they'd be at home in the first advance wars.

2nd Edit: Upgraded gunners feel kinda busted. They're Advance Wars' AA, but can attack without being countered, they're cheap, they can ford rivers and climb mountains, they give you resources when they kill, and four of them can pick apart a tank without taking damage. They make tanks more valuable just by existing, which sort of forces the meta back into its intended rocks-paper-scissors loop, but it's basically not worth taking the two other infantry types when gunners exist.

3rd Edit: Cleared all campaigns, into the bonus content now. With ten hours under my belt, I think I can say that this game really sticks its technicals but is a little afraid of getting creative. I think gunners being cheap multirole superunits kinda holds it back from finding a deeply sweaty pvp audience---although I could be wrong here---and I think the writing being scanter than Advance Wars' keeps the audience from really investing in its world and characters. However, these are quibbles. Advance Wars is one of those games that feels like it's really easy to make, and then the path to designing it is full of pitfalls. Even if it does nothing else, Empires avoids those pitfalls, and this is to its credit. I hope we get more from this series, and I hope it finds its own voice. A second title could be really impressive. More fun than expected, definitely worth the price. An okay Advance Wars knock off. Not going to set the world alight, but okay for a fun few sessions. Fun little game for the fans of the turn based combat genre.

If you liked advance wars, you will like this one. What a great game! Interesting gameplay, great balance in terms of different types of units, plus animations and visuals are super good. Story makes a lot of sense and soundtrack is hot. 
I could only wish there was more to this game, perhaps more campaign missions or more battle maps with higher difficulty, maybe more unique commanders with their own superpowers and benefits or even new playable faction like the one we fight in the last campaign mission.
But overall, I had a blast playing Empires Shall Fall. Perfect little AW clone. Not too difficult, not too hard. Fun map editor. Hopefully there will be a second game with more units and perhaps larger maps. Highly recommend for fans of the genre.",0.13720837720837725

Very large deadzone on control sticks makes them a pain to use.
Game tells me to inspect a book, but there's nothing there. very good game with a very bad checkpoint system. Bigger issue: you cannot go on if you quit the game at the beginning of the Eternal Season chapter, cause you will not have the Buddha statues already taken before. Game is buggy. The sound cut out on my machine early on and never came back. It is admittedly an inexpensive game, but I would still wait a while.

It has been a couple of weeks, but I had entered the house and solved one of the first puzzles. I opened a box after solving a combination lock. As I continued to move through the house, I opened a door and after that the sound cut out. As I said, it was pretty early in the game. Al I remember for sure is that it was very soon after I opened the box. Good luck on the game, I thought that it had a lot of promise. If you love difficult puzzles in formidable environments that take almost an hour (each ) to complete because you keep dying over and over while trying to figure it out, this game is for you. Chiyo was pretty creepy! The puzzles were difficult at first but once you figure out how things work it becomes a lot more fun. Highly recommend. 

Some things that are not clear from the beginning: using magic at all attracts the ghost, but there are certain sections where it is generally okay. They nailed the atmosphere of the levels, nowhere do I feel safe from the horrors lurking in who knows where. Would recommend for a friend. Decided to give this game go even though horror isn't my type of game. Going through the house was definitely creepy with all the noises and the wandering ghost in the hall way got me a couple times and some of the other ghost had me no my toes. Besides that, the puzzle were quite hard for me but when i solved it, i felt like a genius lmao

overall 7.5/10 Nice puzzle horror game
worth a try if you're into the genre
The graphic are good as well
i like there's no actual punish to the player even you fail to escape from the ghost, so i can focus on solving the puzzle xD
-----------------------------------
Hope the Devs could Optimize the game more, FPS drop badly on the mirror stage
(could be my own issue, my PC aint that great..)
Also sometime the respawn point for certain stage is confusing, i have to go back to the puzzle place instead of respawn at somewhere around it
There are some bugs here and there, but so far its not breaking the game and i could finish the game without much issue.

Looking forward for more story happen around Chiyo in the future :) This game is very scary. I always walk slowly before entering any room to avoid jump scare but unfortunately the ghost caught me. I cannot think of the puzzle very well because the ghost will come to me if i not doing anything. Overall the game is great for horror story plus puzzle game.

I am waiting for more from this game devs to develop another good game. Thanks devs for making great game to us. :) A pretty neat puzzle/horror game. It has a great atmosphere, interesting story, a wide variety of puzzles and great looking environments. 

I encountered a few bugs but from what I can see in the patch notes, they have all been fixed already and the devs seem to be working hard to improve the game. The main thing that I really disliked about the game is the checkpoint system because of which I had to repeat a couple puzzles. The other thing is the performance which was also far from ideal. Hopefully the devs can improve the game in this aspect as well. Finally, I believe that horror games work better if they are short but if you think differently, then you might consider the length of this game as a detriment.

All in all, the game is worth the price and there is also a demo version if you want to try it out.",0.03575211392968403

As others pointed out there needs to be more songs as well.  Seems like this song pack was just given half effort by the developers and rushed out the door. Music I would casually listen to on the radio while driving.  Not beat saber material.  I feel like they got away from their core, or ran out of steam.  I have to admit, the whole pack was a letdown.  And only 5 songs...   For a game that's been out for as long as it has been you would think that the library would be a bit bigger.  And they would have more features.  Like family profiles.  But back to the music pack.. sorry folks.. it's a dud... and that's saying allot being that I praised this game when I first got it. The reason why I like beatsaber is because it is really satisfying to go through blocks to the rythm, but lately the devs seem to lean more to the casuals with releasing a rock album and now a pop album, I could excuse the last album as it had a few songs that I liked, but this one is horrible. Whenever beatsaber comes out with a new album, I buy it on the spot as I'd like to support the creators of this amazing game, but also because it has in the past mostly been of better quality that the moddingcommunity has produced. I hope they release a jpop album in the future or another genre known for good beats, but I don't like the current direction they are going in Would not recommend any of the songs in this music pack.

You‚Äôll need to strategically work with the market to maximize your income while covering the cost of your operation in order to follow strange signals and discover what waits at the source.","Game is fun. Very short, campaign is a couple of hours and pretty easy to figure out optimal strategy. Market feature is engaging though. Not a bad buy on sale. For achievement hunters, note that two of the cheevos appear to be busted now; can't complete the weekly change or improve score on same seed. If that were fixed would give wholehearted thumbs up here. Solid ""meh""

It is not a bad game, but very casual gamer type game. Very basic civ builder, more like an idle game for a phone. Passable game I decided to not recommend. Content of the game is very limited, you can finish campaign in less than three hours, leaving you with ""skirmish"" maps. The idea is good, but there is just not enough content - 7 buildings, of which 4 you will be building just on the main planet. 

Generally you will cover all planets with solar panels and extractors. You will do the same with main planet, but then add few farms and domes and research center (no, there is no research in the game, it is just condition to finish mission). And thats all, game over. The UI is not exactly effective, resources are hard to see. 

Not terrible game and might appeal to casual gamer, but thats it. The fact that only 5.5 percent of players finished (3 hours) campaign is quite indicative. Signals started in an interesting fashion; dig materials to rebuild the device and move to the next sector; then the second and third levels bring on a time limit, and no further game mechanics are added. This leaves the game feeling shallow and empty, nothing to change stakes; in fact the stakes even lower once the second half of the game has no time limit. While this makes the game relaxing, it also leaves there not a lot there. There is a daily level you can play, but personally it takes too long for the enjoyment factor, as it encourages you to visit every single planet to try and gain the high score; which could take hours to do optimally.  I have to not recommend from the lack of depth. I wanted to like it, and it has some fun ideas. But the whole user experience feels very indistinct and vague. Half of the resources look the same on the map or with slight recolours, and feel like random mcguffins required for the plot rather than purposeful and different; the need to the put the trade post first isn't intuitive (maybe the first planet should start with one?) and the sense of base building or progression from extraction to research isn't there; and research buildings don't indicate the need for adjacency or build limits. There are just things and mechanics that exist in the game without being explained, and it doesn't make a lot of sense nor make for gameplay I found enjoyable.

It all made for a rather confusing experience, and even after watching the campaign playthrough I didn't find it as fun as I expected from the description. A pleasing aesthetic with chill tunes, but felt pretty lacking in gameplay and variety. It got pretty stale after about an hour, having completed four of the six ""campaign"" missions, and I just wasn't compelled enough to see the last couple of missions through.

What it does, it does well, but there's just not enough meat on the bone.  One of those games where there is little to grab you.  It's a short time-waster and not a bad concept I suppose, but there's really not much to it.  There's also a marked lack of assistance or in-game tutorial, which would be helpful.  I finished the first chapter easy enough and immediately into the 2nd chapter, I'm unable to place anything anywhere. No amount of messing with different things allowed me to do anything at all.  Not sure if it's a bug (there are a few) or not, but that was all it took to move on. Cute game but not nearly enough here to justify a ¬£7 price, I'd maybe recommend at ¬£1. I finished it in 20 minutes and did not feel like there was more to do. I don't really know how to feel about this game.

It was engaging enough to keep me until the campaign was over, the isometric look is simple yet conveying and the soundtrack was limited but not annoying. My problem comes with how I beat it since I'm really sure how it worked. By winging resource harvesting mostly it seemed to do what I was supposed to do yet there wasn't any kind of guide or tips regarding that aspect. As a result, by the end I didn't feel that much of an accomplishment.

Otherwise, if you like resource gathering games this may be up your alley. Just don't expect some of the achievement to work since the weekly challenges haven't been updated for a while.",-0.012195149087672452

I am trying to review some games that maybe haven't had enough attention and with no reviews in English, I thought Grey Zone was a good candidate.

But after purchasing the game with the intention of giving an informed review, I find it to be unplayable after only 15 minutes. I can no longer 'Start Game', it just crashes to desktop.

What I did get to play of Grey Zone was interesting, and I think there is a much larger game hidden behind the bugs (I hope so given the 300+mb download). At one point the Russian-English translation broke down completely in such a hilarious way that if I can ever get it to work again I will upload a screenshot.

The sound track is cool but you have to keep moving to avoid monotony.

The core game-play in Grey Zone is solid, the controls maybe aren't the best but I found myself getting better at a rate that matched the game's increasingly challenging arena style matches. I feel there could be a little more combat/cutscene in the first 15 minutes, but like I explained that is all I've been able to play.

Unfortunately I am not able to recommend buying this game as it's (at least in my case) still quite broken. 
I would love to re-review this title once this issue has been resolved. 

As a first release by developer A.Lepunov I feel Grey Zone has promise, But stability and localization are issues that need to be addressed. 

On the whole (at the moment considering the problems) 2/10

There does still have the fact that for non native English speakers the pronunciation it provides is relatively useless, but that is true for pretty much most attempts of trying to express foreign sounds. Oh, I also suggest you print with two pages per A4 paper, that helps.

[/table] 100/10 It has Sekibanki I HATE FAIRIES I HATE FAIRIES I HATE FAIRIES

Other than the fairies the game is very good. Head is required to beat this game. Cute puzzle platformer featuring my favourite Touhou character, Sekibanki! The gimmick of using her heads as platforms and projectiles is an incredible idea and allowed for unique and intricate puzzles. I completed all main stages with all puzzle pieces and have all the achievements.

The only real shortcoming this game has is that the later puzzles can get frustrating, but only because one mistake will make you have to restart the entire level, which, after spending 5 minutes getting to a point, can be annoying after a while. The puzzles by themselves are very well designed and don't allow for a lot of cheesing.

If there were two things I'd want to see improved in this game, it's:
- A save state system, so solving puzzles would be less frustrating in the later levels, and after you've figured the level out you could then restart from the beginning and properly clear it in a fast manner without having to experiment for solutions.
- Maybe allowing a ""mercy frame"" or two that lets you buffer a new jump input. Only being able to jump right after the moment you landed can make timing subsequent jumps difficult, letting you press the jump input a frame or two earlier would help immensely in making a row of jumps faster and more fluid.

With that said, I think the general concept, cute story, clever level ideas, charming art and amazing music in this game are incredible and fully worth what you pay, even when the game isn't on sale! I was honestly a bit sceptical at first, but seeing all the content this game has to offer made me realise that buying this game was a good choice. Bonus points for having very fun speedrun techniques, always great to see that in a game that includes a timer.

I bought this game while on sale, but honestly, I'd pay the full price for this. Full recommendation, even despite the shortcoming I mentioned. My 7- and 9-year-old daughters really love listening to music by Paradot („Å±„Çâ„Å©„Å£„Å®) on Youtube, and the adorable Touhou artwork that he does of Touhou characters. So when I came across this game, I thought the artwork of Sekibanki looked strangely familiar.... turns out that he did the music and probably the artwork for this game, and so I knew I had to get it!

It's exactly what you would expect from looking at it - a 2D puzzle platformer. The controls are tight and the level design is really excellent, I've been able to get all the collectibles so far even though several of them I thought were impossible at first.

It's not a particularly exciting game, but I've found it to be fun and relaxing. The cutscenes are also fun and super adorable. Sekibanki is clearly the most precious Touhou character and must be protected at all costs! i lost my head while playing this game
its fun, challenging 2d touhou puzzle game with cute art style. i personally dont have too much to say i tihnk its pretty good

Nope, but if it's on sale in a bundle with the base game, then sure, it doesn't hurt as much to pay up. 5/10 A must have for any CRPG or Pathfinder fan. The items are decent but mostly suited for low-level characters. However, the soundtrack is excellent, and the map is solid. Overall, it‚Äôs a good purchase during a seasonal sale or if you‚Äôre looking to complete your Wrath of the Righteous collection. Items in this one are entirely junk that you'll replace pretty much as soon as you get alternative choices...

Let's see, had to look up what I paid for this one, as there's no way I bought this for the listed $19.99.

Hmm...this was bundled with Season 1 and Season 2, with this particular DLC being $5.99 (and the combined total being ~$35 for both seasons and this).

This is not $19.99 worth of DLC. But as a freebie that comes with 2 things worth more than the total price of the 2 others separately, I was happy with it. The soundtrack, and now DLC Soundtrack, makes it worth 20 bucks alone for me. If you don't care for the soundtrack buy the DLC on sale. Garbage I have this on GOG whereas even more of my life is spent on this incredible game. 
I would buy paper towels if they sold it.

1647620,Planet Zoo: Africa Pack,dlc,False,"22 Jun, 2021","Casual, Simulation, Strategy","Embark on an unforgettable African adventure with the Planet Zoo: Africa Pack! Adopt and raise five stunning new animals, master the challenge zoo set in an oasis bazaar, and build out the zoo of your dreams with over 180 beautiful new scenery pieces.","TL;DR: 
Great pack with the animals and enrichment items being the main draw with a couple of unique or helpful scenery options. Also, the timed scenario statue is a Fennec Fox. I think the $9.99 price is okay, but I'd still get it on sale if possible as the main bulk add-on for this pack is the customizable scenery with some great animals. It doesn't need to be a big sale though.

Animals & Habitats:
This is a great pack for just the animals alone. I regularly like using the Fennec Foxes and Meerkats in my zoos. Guests are allowed to enter habitats with Meerkats, Penguins, and Fennec Foxes (though the foxes are a bit shy) and it's fun to create enclosures for them. The Scarab Beetle is also pretty useful in making money for zoos early on because of how quickly they reproduce and how many you can have. The Rhinos are cool too, but are usually a standalone species. You also get 4 new, cute enrichment items that can be used by a variety of animals outside of this pack (other than the tunnel, which is only used by 4 animals total). 

Scenery:
The theming of the scenery is decent, but I don't usually use many pieces from this for my builds. If you're regularly working with an African safari theme though, this is a great addition to maybe focus on Egyptian side of Africa. However, many of the scenery pieces are color customizable and can lead to lots of unique builds that you see in the workshop. Particularly, there are some painted wood beams where every piece of it is customizable to get the perfect wood colors. So if you work with wood a lot, this gives you some extra nice wood accents. There are also some arbor crosses that can be colored however you'd like and work great for fencing. So while there are some pieces that can work amazing with other themes, I still don't really use most of the pieces. 

Nature:
There is basically nothing in terms of plants from this pack. You get about 4 different trees of different sizes, but this doesn't really add to your foliage toolbox. It can make your desert and grassland biomes a tad more interesting, but it's quite barren otherwise. I wouldn't get this if you're hoping for more plant options. peak Beautiful DLC. cool Foxes are adorable. Meerkat, southern white rhino, African penguin, fennec fox, and sacred scarab beetle, a total of 4 habitat animals and 1 exhibit animal. This pack might not include as many different animals as the SEA pack, but I really like the choice of animals for this pack. Meerkats and fennec foxes are super cute and ‚Äòpopular‚Äô animals. The African penguin now makes it possible to have penguins in an outside habitat without running up the power bill, and we get a new rhino, which is always nice.

No sooner does he get back on his feet than is he swept off them by a mysterious girl. As they grow closer, she shows him how the darkest of times are temporary, while the brightest last forever.","A novel where the end is worth it more than most of the journey leading towards it. The game definitely dragged during the first half, but got better during the event linking the halves and the second half. The characters look rather nice and the music is acceptable.

My biggest negatives are the complete lack of any CGs and... technical performance. Never thought I'd have to mention performance in terms of a VN, but the game appears unresponsive for seconds at a time whenever a large amount of characters appear and additionally when changing scenes with them. It also takes a considerable amount of time to even start up and save/load menu functionality breaks if you make the window fullscreen. I'm more bagging on TyranoBuilder at this point than the game, but it is easily the worst VN engine around. Supposedly it's the easiest to just start using, but it lacks so many QoL features that are default elsewhere.

That said, the ending is rather sweet, even if it's already stated on the store page. Voice acting is also a plus that wouldn't have expected to find here either. Before I start the review, one of the user-defined tags is ""Visual Novel"". It is not a visual novel, it is a kinetic novel, so there are no choices (just reading).

I liked the story. It was well written and quite enjoyable. However, it was very short. The music is good, but the use of it is the most important. And that's also well done. The art is good, but the placement and size of the sprites could be adjusted so that it ""agrees"" with the environment more.

Overall, it is a nice kinetic novel to read, and it's good for the price. It is on sale quite often, so it is a good idea to get it then, unless you want to support those who made Keiko Everlasting. An interesting story. The plot is decent, the characters fun (though some have names that are a bit similar). Thing is, there is no way to resize the window, and if you are looking for choices that matter... not here. So I picked this up for less than $1 and I must say it's enjoyable once you get into it, but the problem is the game doesn't do much in the way of storytelling and choices, so it feels like you just reading a book with no say for the first 20 minutes. Only then does your first choice come and it doesn't even have a impact on the story. The story is 95% told and 5% choices.

At least the voice acting is good for the price, but it's completely in Japanese with no way to change it. Only English subtitles are available, but as an anime lover I wasn't bothered by this. A really annoying thing is that the game runs at 720p windowed, which totally breaks immersion. No way to change the resolution (There is NO SETTINGS MENU!!) So the game runs fine, but the borders break the immersion. Also the names of the characters are Japanese. Would be totally fine if they weren't so similar to each other. You will have a hard time trying to remember who is who. Trust me.

Overall: 5.5/10 (Okay story, Decent voiceovers, Effort, Music is excellent. The game is cheap)  ||  (Bad UI, No Settings Menu, runs at 720p windowed, story dragged out)",0.1410632746249184

This one's weird. It's obviously a thirst trap with the giant lady with the massive jugs and also the super sexualized unimaginably thicc fox with her lower body exposed. That said there's weirdly nothing 18+.

Gameplay-wise it's a very basic walking simulator with a couple collectibles to find and an extreme amount of invisible walls.

There is some humour which didn't land with me but might be someone else's thing.

Overall for the price I think it's a good half hour wasted and 5 achievements won. Compared to other Lu games i played ,this one was okay. But it still has that Lu style and story i like. Also the same intriguing storyline and characters. Probably the best developer for cheap shorter experiences for me ,at the moment. There not much as to comment as this game ,is an adventure you have to go through yourself and see if you like it or not. Would not recommend it as a first Lu game to play but nonetheless a fun time.

It features a tutorial, a collection of 4 themed worlds, a few weapons with upgrades for each and 4 different and unique bosses. The games plays rather simply with your standard fair of WASD and mouse or full controller support.

Everything you fight is a pot including bosses, the merchant the big bad, and even yourself. I can say I had fun, even if I had wished the game was juicier and plump with more content.

The real aspect of this game that shines is the very clear vision that Marcelo Tapia has for the universe which he has created. This is very clearly a comic book artist, wanting to bring his work to life and I respect that.
This is an ambitious project which is a lot of fun to play all in all.
Patience is needed, but I promised it's worth it.
GREAT GAME.
Makes me want to play more of Animas Games releases. The game is enthusiastic and super ultimate cool beyond comprehension! The art is amazing, the character designs and the backgrounds are so cool! There is constant variety with enormous bosses and crazy things happening always!

Combat is jank, but fun jank with many crazy moves with all characters that are exciting.

The only problem is the shooting sound is too loud for shooting mode! Please fix in a patch, because I want to keep replaying the game comfortably without super loud shooting sound.

Amazing super powered game, recommended if you're a fan of excitement! It used to promise. Another victim of the early access global disease.
The game has very good intentions. The graphics and visual elements, although it looks a bit unfinished/empty in some rooms, are looking very nice and original if you like hand-drawn 2D. If that's the case, you will love the game's visual identity! Although animations could be slightly more fluid, the game gets a point for this.
Two characters to choose from is a minimum and there's few changes of gameplay between them but that makes a bit of diversity, plus the fanservice is pretty high regarding the girl's outfit, and a third character should appear sometime in the future.
The mix beat'em all / shoot'em up is actually a very nice idea, and I feel like it could work. You press a button and then your character gets his gun and a crosshair appears and you can start shooting stuff in the air. That would be pretty cool if while you were doing that you could move your character ( a bit like in Wild Guns, when you move your crosshair right, you move right and vice-versa ), but instead your character stays absolutely still and you are just playing the sitting duck.
Now, ennemies. They have two major problems. First, they are so dumb they get away from the screen and never reappear. That's a problem when the requirement to get to the next room is to defeat every ennemy in the one you're in. That will make you restart the game a lot.
Secondly, they're almost invincible. If you already played a poorly coded beat'em all, you know what I'm talking about. Hitboxes are absolutely a mess to understand, and ennemies will quickly ( understand: instantly ) attack you when you are in range, and they will beat you to death from this point without giving you any chance to counter. And even if by luck you land the first hit on them, your punch animation will be longer than the ennemy's hurt animation and they will counter attack instantly, and punch you to death. That makes the game very frustrating since it's impossible to beat it without dying a lot.
Fun fact though, the devs seem to be aware of this last point since you have infinite lives for now. So you can just get killed by the first ennemy you encounter, respawn and try to beat him back. But sometimes you will just die 4-5 times against a single ennemy because you don't have invincibility frames to protect you, so if you lose your first attack, you basically die. That leads to ridiculous situations where you get in a room with 8 ennemies, you land one hit on a random ennemy, you get punched to death and die, you respawn, you land one hit, you die and so on...

These last points make the game unplayable in the present state. But once again, there are very good intentions behind the disaster, and I would really love it if the devs could make it playable someday because I'm sure it could be a great game. Let's cross fingers for the future, but releasing this at this point of development is simply absurd. I will keep an eye on it in the next months though. This game LOOKS good, but that is about it. Way too many issues for it to be actually fun. I wanted to like this, but in its current state its not that good of a game.",0.06898148148148145

When you start the game, you will be able to solve the puzzle problem and ask for reasoning ability. Unlock all secrets in 8 rooms and escape. Tense music and a mysterious background await you. Puzzles of various difficulty await you.","As everyone sees in the democlip - the graphic is not at all fitting today¬¥s standards even for a puzzle game. That would be okay, if the gameplay was good. But already in the first room the absence of user friendly playability makes it hard to get in the game. The music could also be better (to raise the athmosphere) but doesn¬¥t get into a symbiosis with the game. 

Overall the game makes it very hard to feel comfortable. Instead of using the mouse for everything (walk, take, use, inventory) like all the other games since at least a decade do, it throws you back to a time, when every action had it¬¥s own button. So the paste is very slow, actions take much longer and this really is an issue for you will have to do try and error a lot because not even the normal hints in the game are done very clearly. And for a puzzle game, try and error is okay at some point, but not too much cause it feels like guessing, rather than working with an idea.

If you can overlook the missing standard comfort functions, you do not need an athmospherical setup and it is on sale, you might give it a try -  and maybe if you do not expect too much. I was deeply disappointed because of reviews I read and expected a lot more.
 This game is pretty hard to finish because the absence of hint to resolve the puzzles.
You can  not save your progress so it is a shot deal or write down all info found to go faster each time you re-start.
Very dark 
You can't find help on the net except for one walkthrough with no comment and no explaination on how to find the solution of each puzzle.
I am glad I got it on special for cheap 1.14
Icouldn't find a web site for the developer or publisher
finish the game anyway jsut to see if it would change but no 
 I would cautiously recommend this game. The puzzles are of a good difficulty and there's enough of them to justify the price, but the translation is a little dicey and there are a few errors in the actual puzzles/hints themselves that are very misleading. This game is the first I've played that feels like a real life escape room. I considered the puzzles 40% cakewalk and 60% ""holy shit, how the fuck do I get out of here? I'm so screwed."" Great puzzles!

This game is a legitimate challenge. I was able to figure out most of the puzzles on my own, but I needed assistance on a few, and honestly, I still don't know some of the answers (the process of elimination got me through a couple of them).

The final puzzle is a bit of a letdown, but it may be due to the language barrier. The English translation is a bit misleading, but I was able to determine the correct answer regardless - I just didn't feel confident in my answer.

Overall, this game is outstanding, despite some of its noted flaws. If you love escape rooms, get a group of people (2-4, I'd say), buy this game, and spend an evening playing through it together. If I could erase my memory and go back to play it again, that's what I would have done.

If anything, add in a hint system to give the player a nudge in the right direction. That would make it a little bit more like many escape rooms (in America, at least), where limited hints are provided. Then again, the discussion boards on Steam should be enough to provide the helpful push to complete each challenge, so that isn't really a necessity.",0.06248108157991878

These scenes mesh well with the main game plot, the models are the same hot ones, too, and the sex is great. I highly recommend this DLC to any fan of the series. And it's a nice way to encourage the dev to release more titles, too. ENG:
This small spin-off, lasting a little more than one chapter and accessible from the fork sign at the top of the main menu, next to the Halloween special, takes place during the events of the very first part of the first season of Motherless, when Natassija was still Sister Anamarija for our hero, starting shortly after the first confrontation between Sunny and Dick upon Booker and Shaniqua's return from home and showing us an extended version of what happened in this period of time until the meeting of the ex-nun with Valerie.

Perhaps due to the return to the paradigm of the first season, however, in this DLC, choices return to being present which at times influence the continuation of the story, giving the player back a bit of control over what, all things considered, passes from from initially being a multiple-choice visual novel, with even a couple of sandbox-style moments, to a more static kinetic novel of the second and third seasons.

It's a bit of a shame that, at the moment, this DLC is not listed together with all the others from Motherless - Season 1, but it has to be searched for separately, this certainly reduces its visibility on the store.

[spoiler]Personal note: obviously the best girl here can only be sister Anamarija, glasses included, whose ingenious ideas are at least remarkable, followed by Asia, who now we know could also be used as a bike air horn(y)-like doorbell.[/spoiler]

ITA:
Questo piccolo spin-off, della durata di un po' pi√π di un capitolo e accessibile dal cartello biforcazione nella parte alta del menu principale, a fianco dello speciale di Halloween, si colloca durante gli eventi della primissima parte della prima stagione di Motherless, quando Natassija era ancora sorella Anamarija per il nostro eroe, partendo da poco dopo il primo confronto tra Sunny e Dick al ritorno da casa di Booker e Shaniqua e mostrandoci una versione estesa quanto successo in questo lasso di tempo fino all'incontro dell'ex-suora con Valerie.

Forse a causa del ritorno al paradigma della prima stagione, per√≤, in questo DLC, tornano ad essere presenti delle scelte che a tratti influiscono sul proseguo della storia, restituendo al giocatore un po' di controllo su quella che, a conti fatti, passa dall'essere inizialmente una visual novel a scelta multipla, con addirittura un paio di momenti in stile sandbox, alla pi√π statica kinetic novel della seconda e terza stagione.

√à un po' un peccato che, al momento attuale, questo DLC non sia annoverato insieme a tutti gli altri di Motherless - Season 1, ma debba essere cercato a parte, questo ne riduce senz'altro la visibilit√† sullo store.

[spoiler]Nota personale: ovviamente qui la best girl non pu√≤ che essere sorella Anamarija, occhiali inclusi, le cui trovate geniali sono quantomeno rimarchevoli, seguita da Asia, che ora sappiamo potrebbe essere benissimo usata anche come campanello a trombetta.[/spoiler] I think Mr does good work so Ill leave a positive but this isnt worth it tbh

413360,Deus Ex: Mankind Divided - System Rift,dlc,False,"22 Sep, 2016","Action, RPG",Discover the secrets hidden within the Palisade Blade in Deus Ex: Mankind Divided‚Äôs first story DLC.,"Overpriced, but if you get the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game (which you should) this is a pretty good 3-hour dlc. Worse than most sidequests. Boring identical-looking corridors. Felt like a chore. It's an ok DLC with enough content to justify its existence. It has some Thief vibes (because the whole DLC is literally bank robbery with a preparation phase included). It has a nice atmosphere, interesting characters, and a story that actually has a start and finish, unlike the original Mankind Divided. 

People here are mostly complaining about the price being too high, but the whole Deus Ex franchise is constantly on 85% discount, so I don't think it's a problem anymore. Is it worth you time though? I would definitely say ""yes"". Always wanted to get into this place. It's an Ok expansion, but it's not worth full price.
Get it for 75% or better deal. Not worth the full price, it only takes 2-3 hours to finish this. Other than that DLC is okay (not great, just okay), but I hate it that it's not tied to the base game playthrough, as there are not enough Praxis Kits/experience to actually have fun exploring it and if you don't pick up certain skills you're pretty much fucked at the end (if you're going for the achievments). It is not worth it, especially at full price. Even though, there is a new area, gameplay time is pretty short. There are not much new features for this DLC to be worth your money. Story of the game is pretty irrelevant to main game; it is just the unnecessary and boring foundation for Breach. Sadly, you need DLCs for achievements. h Wish this wasn't a tie-in to the weak online mode. [b]Pros:[/b]

However, to be honest the overall playing experience wasn't very enjoyable. The quest lines are wayyy too straightforward, repetitive and plain. Sometimes almost feels as if the dialogue was AI generated based on the main script. 

me: Let me see the person who stole my stuff.
NPC:  NO! I shall protect him!
me: I just want to talk.
NPC: Okay, come on in.

That's literally what happened in the main storytelling, like seriously??? I was expecting a fun, swinging adventure but found myself bored, understimulated and frustrated. This game is very buggy to the point that important objects suddenly disappear, npc's repeat themselves or do not talk at all, etc making it impossible to continue and to get all the achievements. Music score and scenery is good, but the characters are ugly and the story is dull. It feels half-done.

[b]Cons[/b] (mostly bugs)
[list]
    [*]Keys may disappear from inventory. This was not a game-breaking bug for me since it only happened twice during my playthrough and I didn't need those keys to proceed, but some areas will be inaccessible.
    [*]Players sometimes can't get back to the same dialogue option if they didn't exhaust the dialogue tree in one go. If you fail to get a quest during your first conversation with certain characters, you won't be able to get it for the rest of this playthrough.
    [*]There's no manual save option. If a key disappears or a quest is missed, players can't load previous saves.
    [*]Main character easily gets stuck. Can mostly be fixed by sending your animal companions away.
    [*]Some minor quests can't be completed since relevant dialogues simply don't pop up.
    [*]The game may crash on startup or take a long while to load.
    [*]Can't trigger the romance with [spoiler]Marla Lee[/spoiler].
    [*][spoiler]Two Aidans will appear in his room at the end of the game should the player choose to romance him. It's actually kind of hilarious but still, a bug. [/spoiler]

I still would recommend this game to anyone who genuinely likes the 1920's vibe. I'll edit this comment if the bugs are fixed. confesso que comprei esse sem esperar muita coisa e acabou sendo uma surpresa maravilhosa pois fiquei MUITO  entretida! very fun and very good story line well done Don't buy this.
Glitches (some of which have been known about for years without being resolved), and no ability to save your game or have separate saves to protect against glitches. There is a reason that one of the two guides on steam is about how to save your game.

I like the idea, and I think I would enjoy the game if it weren't for the frequent glitches.
Like quests disappearing and having no way to continue the story, or conversations being unobtainable if you previously left the conversation before asking everything.

Or, the issue I just encountered after 4hrs of playtime, keys disappearing from your inventory. Meaning I can't get into the apartment where certain items are placed. This issue with keys has been known about for TWO YEARS. And they still have not fixed it. I love how many sidequests there are! If your favorite thing to do in RPGs is walk around and talk to NPCs (and romance them) this is the game for you.
I love the lore and the world building in this game, and how the creators mixed the 1920s with a fantasy setting. I also love how the main character is already an established hero (well at least to some races). It's nothing I've ever seen before and I found it super interesting! I highly recommend this game! I fell asleep several times while playing this glorified fetch quest galore. Rather primitive 2.5D graphics that made my computer work harder than some newest AAA games. 
Imagine badly written RPG without RPG and combat. That's what you get. Boring and illogical story with bland characters with no personality. Since there is no combat dialogues and story should be main focus but... dialogues are extremely short, there is often only one allowed path (why multiple choices if you are, in the end forced to go with only one of them?).

In this platforming survival arena you collect points and survive long as you can. Play as a cute Mushy who adventures nearby forest and fights for their life. Can you survive long enough to get new high score?,"The pixel art graphics and soundtracks give the game a cool arcade vibe. 

It's super easy to learn the mechanics, and it gets more fun as you unlock more upgrades for your character. 

I had fun grinding for high scores and replaying on harder difficulties.

One thing that I found annoying was the jumping because you have to hold down to jump higher. While fighting many enemies at once I used to press space and release instantly, but the character barely leaves the ground. I believe it would have been better if the character would jump higher on normal press and go even higher if you hold. So far incredibly enjoyable! I loved the action 2D side scroller system combined with the tower defense one! Good little game, I like the kill summary when you die. Fun game where you shoot mobs and progress with perks after every level. Cute little roguelite/tower defense game. It was fun to experiment with all the different elements, depending on if you want to burn or slow enemies, etc. Fairly simple, but can be pretty hectic!

Had a good time with it for the modest asking price. Looking forward to more from this dev, Fun roguelike that my son and I really enjoyed! A fun little game.

It works out of the box on the SteamDeck.

It has an old school vibe, or vintage gaming by it's graphics and sound effects.

Seen the low price, it would be a shame to miss it ! I'm enjoying this game a lot so far. It has a nice retro feel to it. The music is great.

Learn spells, defeat bosses and escape the evil in this 2D metroidvania.","I really enjoyed my experience with Mage, it's a fun little Metroidvania with nice little challenges to keep you engaged. I especially liked the last boss, which worked very well with the games mechanics. Mage is a fun little platformer which is great to play when you have a little bit of time to spare. The game feels simple to understand yet has a complex level layout which is extremely well thought out, similar to Metroid. The levels require you to go back and forth to discover secrets you may have missed, as well as to access new areas you could not before. This sense of exploration and adventure felt very rewarding, especially as your character becomes stronger. The bosses were also fun little fights to break up all of the exploring, and some of them had a surprising challenge to them.

Overall I definitely recommend Mage, it's unique, short, and has a lot to offer if you're looking for a small platformer game with a few unique mechanics and some funny commentary! Short and easy metroidvania that's surprisingly good! This is a good old-schooled game, if you want to experience old-schooled indie game this one is very good start Funny and cute game.

The Master club is a collection of 9 games that, while temperamental, can be pretty fun if you're just playing casually and not seriously.

While there is nothing here that stands out all the games work (just about) and you can find some enjoyment here, especially the air hockey.

No option to use locomotion so movement is utterly rubbish, you just teleport around like an idiot, which really breaks immersion. Graphics are good. Clipping and object interaction is all over the place. This doesn't feel like a thing I should have paid for. If someone told me it was the work of a teenager, spending his free time on his computer putting a game together as the early efforts to start a career in game development, then I could at least respect his ambition.

But in the context of a fledgling VR market with genuinely good quality titles thin on the ground, I can't review this game except as the serious gamer I am.

This game is appalling. The plot is completely detached from the game, literally the plot could be anything and it would still ""fit"" this extremely basic piece of work. The game world is sparse, graphics are basic, game mechanics are basic, any logic to the puzzles is basic to non-existent.

 This will be a vague, scratchy review. I had played through this many months ago, and beat the episode, but it has been some time since then, and when I made the video, the game seemed slightly updated, but it glitched, and I could not complete it or show you the cool scene. That's more or less is the gist of my review. This game is a decent experience, maybe even a bit spooky, but the choreography is bad, and the game is a big buggy, so you might get frustrated and lose the vibe, or worse: have to restart it because something screwed up and you lost the key through the floor. The puzzle-age isn't that great either. It's basically pixel hunting. Look inside the vase in the office scene, and behind the blank prior to that in the shed scene. [i]It equally sucks to have to quit the game to find the spoilers because they hide stuff to make you use up your 2 hour refund window.[/i] The item you need is prolly in the corner, which isn't really a puzzle. Well worth the price, for sure. A gem if on sale or in a bundle. [spoiler]Overall, it compares well to Trespass Episode 1, which is another similar and buggy experience, but here, you are not being ripped off. There is no lady in this VR game though, just these giant eyeballs.[/spoiler][list][*][quote]

It's like a demo for VR that's really in love with picking up books and soda cans. The play is one pixel-hunt after another, and your reward for finding the pixel is a jump scare. The story is a cliche, the sounds and music are very primitive (free downloads, I think) and objects, including critical objects, can clip through floors and walls and get stuck.

Have you ever wanted to try and find the marble in the oatmeal, while dodgeballs rain down on your head? This game has that experience, for some reason.

An hour of gameplay, if you can plow through the frustration.

Play for free or maybe for a dollar, if you have literally nothing else to do. Definitely not worth $7. Very well done. Had a few jump scares and the atmosphere left me unsettled. I'm very curious about the next few installments and I'm looking forward to playing them

That being said...Don't play this game when you are at home alone, at night and with most of the lights off. Especially don't play this game if your husband comes home unexpectedly and thinks the best way to get your attention is to lightly touch your shoulder.  When you didn't hear him come home because you had headphones in.

I'm pretty sure he didn't scare me to death but I'm not positive yet. Great experience, very creepy. Works well with the Oculus. Looking forward to the next act! Do not buy this game. Way too buggy. Can't get past the first house, because items keep disappearing or i can't pick them up. Must move them with other stuff and sometimes FINALLY i am able to pick the required item up again. I'm sure a lot of time went into creating this game, but unfortunately I simply can't recommend it. It can be buggy sometimes and the puzzles are just meh..not to mention the way it looks. Marlene is a VR horror experience you have to try if you are into these kind of games. You know ;) the ones that give you goosebumps and make you feel like there is someone behind you D:

Im not a man of many words so if you want to see for yourself if this game is something for you, check out my VOD of it below. But yeah, a thumbs up from me here, looking forward to new episodes of this, hopefully coming soon.

Oh and the way I managed to get a certain item in this game has now been fixed ;D so good luck finding out the way to get it ;)

https://www.twitch.tv/brewsleetv/v/101487742 I have played this several times but only get stuck in the first building. Very frustrating with no obvious way to advance in the game. No sense of what the game is about and what I am trying to accomplish. This is frustarting and just get stuck in a couple of rooms with no way out.

Clicker: Glad Valakas is a very poorly made clicker/number incrementer game with just a few little upgrade paths.  The game is just a joke game to lambast a popular streamer and has zero merit as an actual PC game for PC gamers, it's just shovelware polluting Steam.  There's also some achievement spam going on, but the achievements are all in Russian.

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

The artwork here is terrible, it's a blend of old retro pixel ""art"" used as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics, and some of the most amateurish MS-Paint style drawings (I won't deign to call these ""illustrations"").  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget to arrange someone who can do graphics properly, or lack of talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result of these decisions.

There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics. 

The game features mostly static, barely animated 2D images, the kind of thing you expect to see in browser/flash games.  While the artwork itself, while mediocre, might be considered passable, the visual presentation here is negligible, it might as well be a slideshow or a Youtube video.  Pac-Man, Space Invaders and Asteroids had more advanced animation and visuals going on than this game does.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Clicker: Glad Valakas is relatively cheap at $2 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.

[b]Note:[/b] Valve have marked this game as ""Profile Features Limited"" at the time of this review.  This is usually caused by poor sales figures for the game (to date).  Until this status changes, this game will not count towards your Game Collector counts, achievements or any other Steam meta-accomplishments, nor can it be displayed in some profile showcases.  If these factors are important to you, it may be worth holding off before buying this game.

[b]Note:[/b] Because this is more of a ""joke"" game, intended to draw attention from controversy or in the hopes of going viral because it's ""so bad it's good"" (but it isn't good at all), there's nothing here to offer to serious gamers.  As usual, with most awful/joke games, all the comedians come out of the woodwork.  The vast majority of the reviews for this game are joke reviews, such as ""this game cured my cancer, saved my marriage, changed my life"" etc.  Because most of the reviews are as insincere as the game itself is, the positive review score for this game should be disregarded. This game is about one of the most extraordinary streamers Runet, it is a clicker in which you have to stay by Glad Valakas. You have to earn DP for which you can improve rooms, voice accompaniment, as well as increase the production of DP. Good luck!

[b]would not recommend[/b], maybe only to get a new 100%'d game and achievements but there's easier and mostly more fun ways to get those. What is ""Clicker: Glad Valakas""?

It's a mindless stupid clicker game. You click on the rolling face on the bottom to gain money, or on the activities when there is a green head above them. You use the money to upgrade ""main"" (increases your money gain from head clicking), upgrade the activities (seems to do absolutely nothing except possibly unlocking other sounds for the activities, so it just wastes money). Eventually you want to upgrade three rooms you have, and while you upgrade, click on every new thing once to get achievements.

Since the upgrades are expensive, you just click for hours, have no real motivation, and eventually learn that you can just cheat by pressing ""Y"", but that would feel really bad. So you just click on until you lose all motivation and write a review telling everyone what a horrible game this really is.

Do not buy! Not on a sale! Maybe get it for free, but never play, unless you want to suffer for achievements.

Recommended: No! There is almost no gameplay here. You'll just click an button for two hours in order to unlock all of the room addons, which are still graphics. The audio is annoying and contributes nothing. trash, just trash the exit button does not even work. they don't have any subtitles for English and when you hit the exit button the game starts saying things in what I  assume is Russian and there are not any English subtitles and it prevents you from leaving unless you close the tab yourself through task manager or pressing the X or the windows button to close the tab through the task bar. T.L.D.R: its trash, this is what happens when you mix bad game development with large amounts of vodka and bad decisions.

It feels more like a concept than an actual game. I grasp the gameplay, if you can even call it that, but there's really nothing to do in the game other than stock shelves.
The art style is cute, though. I built my dream small & cute market. Graphics and Aesthetics are very nice. Quite varied in terms of achievements, replayable. This game is simple but addicting. Highly recommend if you need a good time waster. No employees, graphics are terrible, no zoom, no option to adjust speed. You have to spam click to restock everyday. It's good, a little slow cus you need to constantly watch and open the store to get money. But otherwise it reminds me of an idle store game, but every minute or so you need to open the store to continue. Another chill and fun game like the developer's other games. You should try and enjoy it. A cute and chill game. I enjoy building my little shop to sell various products. Decorations are also really cute and overall this game has a relaxing vibe. Great for relaxing after a long day. Cute graphics, easy gameplay. Chill game for hard times....

It's just too absurd, even for my standard. It got potential to become something more if the developer are willing to make some adjustment. The premise of exorcising ghost through H is a bit uncommon as of now, but it works with these kind of game genre. But it just fall a bit short on the gameplay element. Here's a few things I suggest the developer implement:

[list]
[*] Implement randomizer for crystal spawn. You can make a few fixed spawn points dotted around the map and maybe put the game object inside an array so when a randomizer function pick a location from to spawn the crystal, it will be random. That way, the player will have to look the crystal every new playthrough.
[*] Give a few more scares that are not just sounds of troubled breathing. A few jumpscares here and there wouldn't hurt as long as it's not overused. I like one of the instances where you open the door and see one of the ghost just standing there. You can use that to your advantage and maybe put a few more of those around. Maybe it's looking at the player from afar, or maybe when the player turn their head the ghost are standing behind them
[*] Implement better textures. The textures for the male character is just horrible. from thigh down it looks like he is wearing stockings. A few of the ghosts faces also need a better texture overall.
[*] (Optional) Implement timer to pressure the player to move faster. The game is like a walk in the park without anything at stake. Make it so when exorcising the ghost the timer stop so the player can enjoy the scene but also pressuring the player to move quickly afterwards.
[*] There's already a gallery feature in the game, so why now scene viewer so the player can rewatch the scenes of their exorcism.
[/list]

Overall there's something unique here, but it's too undercook for my taste.

This really shouldnt be on steam. This game i pretty good. Its not very long and the scenes are pretty okay. The graphics and animations are ok as well. Sadly sometimes a litlle buggy but nothing game breaking. Its ok to buy for the full price. I wasnt really a fan of the phone call achievment. Its ok to buy Sounded interesting but the game is full of gamebreaking bugs,i had to start over like 3 times because of them and there was no save function either.
Got stuck near a wall in a bathroom that i couldnt move away from anymore,after drinking the bottle in the cellar and talking with one of the npc,s,the dialogue,,broke''and on the first attempt i was just sent back to the mansion despite me clicking on something different.
Sometimes the camera just bugs out and shows you a really odd angle but the most annoying bug of all,was when i cleared the game(or so i thought)and right before showing me the ending i was shown a empty bed and my character was somehow stuck....in front of it,on the floor,couldnt move,couldnt do anything,and there was no context as for why im even there or what happened.

Obscene Mansion

This has to be one of the most unoptimized games I've ever played.
The strange thing about this one is I tried to set my Nvidia 3080 to cap the framerate at 60 and the game would not let me go below 120 at startup it was running at 600.

I did manage to change the scaleability settings (Not Ingame) they kept defaulting back to epic. I had to reconfigure the .ini which was annoying.

As for the game its was ok, never saw the end had to kill the game 3 times because of cpu and gpu overheating within 5 - 10 minutes even running my fans on maximum I was struggling to keep the heat down. Had no option other than to uninstall as its unlikely that it will ever see the optimization it needs. Nice short adult game. Done everything except secret achievement (something with calling phone) in 1 hour.

No interaction during sex, you can only move camera. This game is really boring.
At times it is more scary than exciting.
The scenes are not interesting at all. The gallery is only with the magazines without the scenes. What is the point .
Two or three replays and that's only because of the achievements, which are shorter each time.

This is... not the kind of game I normally review. I play and review almost exclusively first person exploration games. However in my obsession to play and classify them all, I'm sometimes forced to broaden my horizons.

Now let me be clear: I have no issues with sexy games. I love a good sex as much as the next guy. But it's also not what I'm looking for when reviewing this game, meaning I'm going to judge this in comparison to other first person exploration games, not other porn games. You can probably imagine how that's going to go.

The game works like this: you walk around a house looking for five crystals and five photographs. You then need to find the location of the photograph and place a crystal there, and an unskippable cutscene showing the character humping a girl will play.  After humping all five girls, you get to hump a sixth girl and the game ends.  There are the remnants of a storyline, but it's nothing worth mentioning. There are no voiceovers or puzzles.

The modeling and mapping are actually pretty good.  However the assets are identical to a number of other horror games I've played, leading me to believe they come from some asset pack on the Unreal store.  In fact, the layout of several of the rooms are exactly identical to the game Pacify, so even the rooms are probably pre-made.  I'm not against premade assets, but that level of unoriginality is a mark against the game for me.

Overall, I didn't think this game has much going for it. The gameplay is lackluster, the story is barebones, and the sex scenes aren't even appealing. You can skip this one.",0.03450687275687272

For now to wait, Keep improving the game, Greetings from Mexico The plot was shit, the map sucked balls, and the amount of rounds you need to put in a Z is retarded including head shots!!!!
p.s Make some better fucking maps already!!!! ok? It looks like am interesting game. I however cannot play it as it does not have an option for inverting the Y axis on the mouse. Although these are based on some of the assets from the same game Resilience Wave Survival
It has a baser for a good game.
At 79p or $1 its a good investment only if the developer puts a lot more work into it.
It has its bugs such as some of the functions like inspecting item and not being able to get out of the cycle or shootin undead and hits not registering.
Will recommend as hopefully the game will develop better in the future updates. The game is very early access. We all know the risks with buying early access but I have to say this might even be considered pre-alpha stage. The game has very little content as of me writing this review. The map is very small I have only came across two buildings. One being the building you see in the picture on the steam page. The other being a tower not too far from the first building.  There are no animals to hunt which per the description of the game it says ''variety of anmials'' to hunt.  In all honesty I can't say too much becuase the game lacks content.  
This is a game that you should wait until multiple updates come out before you buy. I do believe you will be upset if you spend money on it right now. 

One positive thing is it does run smooth for such an early access game. ive been playing steam games for years now. Im fully aware of the risk you take getting into an early access game, but this was just down right horrible.  
1. once you enter the game there is no way to exit the game without hitting the windows key and manually closing the game window.
2. the map is very very small with no boarder and if you fall off the map you just fall. no death, no restart. nothing, you just fall. then you have to revert to the first issue i posted. 
3. there are no animals in which to hunt for food so you can forget about that. and as i wondered the small map i saw nothing that would give you the food or water the survival part of the game demands of you.

right now i would not buy this game. with in 30 minutes i was asking for a refund. more time needs to be spent on this game development before i would ever suggest buying it, even at the 8.99 i paid for it. do not waste your money on this. the idea sounds good but they are far from a game that could be enjoyable, even in early release.",-0.04613186628186628
318840,Tempopo,game,False,"17 Apr, 2025","Casual, Indie","A psychedelic soundscape in the sky. Puzzle through the seasons by conducting chaotic Tempopo to rescue musical flowers. Design and populate your melodic garden, then let the music play!","A nice puzzle game that looks daunting at first, but is honestly very inviting and intuitive. You'll find mechanics click very quickly only for the game to really ramp it up at the end. Don't worry though, there are hints to help you navigate even the most challenging puzzles out there!

Check it out, it's a pleasant and fun time :) recommending this because I like WitchBeam but with a very big caveat: this is strictly a game for kids, or for someone dipping their toes into puzzle games. because the solutions are extremely pre-canned, you aren't really solving puzzles so much as you're just doing trial-and-error runs until you've used the pre-set amount of items in the right location. you can set stuff down in the wrong place, but mistakes are immediately obvious and you can't use the wrong amount of items, because each level gives you exactly the amount for the exact solution they intend. i don't mind a puzzle game with exacting solutions, but i do mind there's no real way to mess things up because it makes the game incredibly simple and easy. There are plenty of things to like about Tempopo. The soundtrack is amazing and had me bouncing in my seat through every level. The developer states in the discussion forum that it's a game for all ages, but thematically, it's clearly aimed at kids: from the cartoon protagonist Hannah to her cutesy dancing friends. That's fine; it's obvious from the trailers that's what you're getting. Graphics are vibrant and smooth.

My disappointment is with the puzzles themselves. I love puzzle games and the thrill that comes with reasoning through a solution. The problem in Tempopo is that progression comes through too much trial-and-error. There's so much chaos in a condensed space, you really can't predict movement ahead of time so each solution comes down to placing your commands almost at random and seeing how much farther you get. Creature movement also seems random at times. (""Why did they turn right and not left?"") I cleared levels, but half the time it felt like luck.

Tempopo has a lot in common with HUMANITY. But in my opinion, the latter does a better job of setting up a series of clear obstacles and rewarding logical planning to arrive at a solution. Success feels earned.

I can certainly see the appeal of Tempopo for some players, especially younger ones. It's just not my kind of puzzle game. Extremely good game. Tempopo is a [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_game]programming game[/url], a subgenre of puzzle games. You have inputs (the pink Tempopo); you have to ""alter their state"" (grab flowers); and then you have to direct the Tempopo to the output square.

But, true to the game's (user-defined) Psychedelic tag, this carries much nicer and wackier vibes than more straightforward programming games. The music is also exceptional, and it's pretty easy to zone out while thinking about a tricky puzzle in the later sections.

The large amount of extra content. Tempopo's sandbox music editor (the Melody Garden) has *tons* of room for creative expression -- it's also a relatively early unlock. The various additional challenges are really cool, too: there are the official challenges from the devs in at least two forms, but (IMO) players can create/share their own unique challenges. Tempopo is a fun and challenging puzzle game by Witch Beam! I've been a huge fan of Witch Beam's previous two games (Assault Android Cactus and Unpacking) so when I've played the Tempopo demo back in PAX 2022,  I was hooked into it! After a few years of waiting... I can confirmed that it is worth the wait!

The game is like Lemmings mixed with Chu Chu Rocket as you place tiles/instructions on one of the 120 islands to guide your Tempopo whilst collecting the flowers that the protagonist (Hana) lost because she played a song so bad that it formed a tornado and blew them away! There are the directional arrows, lift, block, smash and push which may not seam like a lot but the possibilities are endless! There are moments that really had my head scratching, thankfully there is a hint system which tells you if you've an instruction you've placed is in the right spot.

I love the music theme in this game and the music itself is great as well! Hana is a conductor who lead the Tempopo who hop in sync of the music and the flowers they collect are also based on a music instrument which is rad! I love the cute art style as well!

It has a lot of puzzles spanning across 60 Islands for the main game and an additional 60 after completing the 60th Island totalling to 120! 

I highly recommend you to check it out! Delightful puzzle game, a real brain bender. The hints are nice for when you get really stuck, but it is very satisfying to figure things out. Puzzles are brilliantly designed, many of them give you red herrings for how you think you ought to solve them, but then when you discover the real solution, it's a real lightbulb moment. This is a really nice puzzle game! There's a lot of depth to how things can play out, but the clarity and appeal of the visuals and audio really makes things wonderful to pull off! The difficulty options also make it great for gamers of all skill levels. Solid puzzle game, but not surprised coming from devs who actually care about making things work properly. The first half is a bit straight forward and kind of easy, but the back half throws in some more challenges and a few noodle scratchers. Don't forget though, this isn't the most hardcore puzzle game in the world, but that's okay, it's still a lot of fun. 

Only criticism I have is that some of the music isn't really to my taste, but that's completely subjective. It's still produced well and does exactly what it says on the tin. There's a lot to dig into if you want one of the weirdest DAWs ever, which is nice, but not something I spent any time with. Oh, and the gamepad controls are a bit lacking in places - I personally hate using analog sticks to control an on-screen cursor, but the game works fine with a mouse... use ye a mouse.

For my money, it's worth it for the main 60 puzzles, which were enjoyable and challenging enough. Plus, I like how all of the solutions can be eventually nutted out with iteration alone, rather than arbitrary physics combinations that never feel purposeful. At least I know that i struggled because of my own dumb brain, and succeeded with the same dumb brain.

Poilished and well put together - exactly what I was expecting from this developer. I'm rotating multiple lemmings in my mind to the most lovely tune.

This runs great on Steamdeck! At time of writing, it has not been verified. A neat little indie gem that is absolutely worth a playthough.",0.13688999905517765

This Collector‚Äôs Edition unlocks the Bounty Hunter, a powerful new AOE damage-dealing class armed to the teeth with explosive weapons, plus trick anti-grav and shield gadgets. You'll also receive an exclusive Costume, Legendary Weapon, and a host of useful items:","This class makes no difference to the game.

All they have for this is images because the gameplay for it is EXTREMELY SLOW Starting out and after farming your skills feels very lack luster later.

Your focus for this class is crit dmg. Because you HAVE TO DO MAJOR DMG with EVERY HIT since you seriously shoot slowly. Main attack has 20m range. Every skill seems to have a global cooldown. You left and right click have the same attack speed... as well as most of you others moves.

What they should have done is give you a reason to play it. Make it part of the story like the attempted to do with fire starter. But this feels like the skyforge team just put all their chips on the table cause they have no where else to go.

I spent the $35...and I wish I hadn't. I was so adamant about not spending but it was that or end up seeing other people buy this thing. I had to know if it was worth it. And its not.

The Weapon you get only increase your chance at activating you devine weapon. Its a weapon drop you can get from doing Pvp and losing. It increase your dmg output by a large amount... but even with that weapon I struggled to complete fights in game due to how slow the combat feels.

The Outfit you get from the DLC pretty much only changes the cloth on your head and cap to the dirty sand like yellow and you mask glow change to blue with a bit of yellow. Its like something you would get from completing the skill tree... only worse.

You can spend $15 and get 1 month of gameplay time on world of warcraft.. you don't even get 15 days of premium with this. Assuming premium is like 0.50 a day. That is $7.00 off the $35 price tag.

Lets say the outfight was worth about $5

The weapons was $10

That leaves $13 for Ether, Alerium, and Star of Rebrith.

Based on price tag...Honestly... you are getting a decent deal here... but at the same time you aren't because this content doesn't improve the game at all.

Story wise they new class tell you nothing new. And i feel like there are better options for combat be it close or long range. It doesn't feel nessesary.

Don't get this. I can not support this content any more then i already have. It didn't feel worth it. I am still very sad I got it... and even sadder this game seems like it won't ever be fun for me again.",0.014116161616161612

Enjoy it so much! A simplistic but very grind-heavy game that is backed up by the sheer force of Doraemon and all of other Fujiko-san's other works. The nostalgia value factors heavily into this game as that is one of the strongest factor in the game. If you enjoy Fujiko-san's works or know a lot about them, you will be rewarded a lot for playing this.
I would not really recommend this to players who doesn't like grindy and passive gameplay, or people who is unfamiliar of Fujiko-san's works. However, if they have, at least, the basic knowledge of Doraemon, this game may be worth looking into. dammit, I played too much This is THE best Kairosoft game ever. I would of never imagined them teaming up with Doraemon, a franchise that I followed since I was like 2. And almost 5 decades later, I find myself completely nostalgic over this release. 

I highly recommend it not just for nostalgic reasons, but for gameplay as well. mercilessly bulldozing my neighborhood in the pursuit of expanding my dorayaki dynasty <3 I was salivating and creaming while playing this game. I've never sat so still while just fucking decorating my build and making sweets. I think this really shows how autistic I am.

1083420,Commander Babes,game,False,"14 Jun, 2019",Casual,"From out of an old vase emerge two Sengoku Era generals but... they're hot babes?! Our protagonist Jun finds himself responsible for helping Uesugi Kenshin and Takeda Shingen adapt to modern Japan, as well as fulfilling their (after)life-long regret of not experiencing the joy of motherhood.","Takeda Shingen was a gay guy and Uesugi Kenshin was a sexually ambiguous dude in real life. I like the way they are depicted in this vn much better, especially Kenshin. 

The writing is not perfect by any means, so I had to mentally rewrite it as I read.

The voice actresses for Kenshin and Shingen are very pleasant to listen to.

Kenshin is my favorite. This is, without a doubt, the worst game I have ever played. I sometimes buy these Japanese visual novels for a laugh; and while the concept of this one seemed to be fun and self-aware, the fact is that whoever wrote this trash took it 100% seriously.
With story and writing being the focus of these games (besides the hot fast oozing s-x), I'll start by saying that it is without a doubt the worst writing I've ever encountered in a video game, which includes the atrocity that was Dear Esther! Characters exist solely to spout sentences that convey no individual personality at all, while these sentences only exist to connect one disgusting h-ntai scene to the next. The writing and possibly translation was clearly done with a thesaurus in one hand and the other clutching their crotch, because the use of needless synonyms and typical thesaurus-words plugged into sentences that sound like they're copied straight from Wikipedia make this game read like it was written by a 14 year old in a single lunchbreak. I was only interested in the dialogue, skipping the s-x scenes as quickly as possible; but after a while, I started skipping dialogue as well, upon learning that this game truly has *nothing* interesting to offer me.
Meanwhile, the h-ntai scenes are all loathsome trash, all with the same despicable concept behind them: the thought that the ultimate wish of every woman is motherhood, and that they all have the same impregnation fantasy. This creepy, borderline fascist thought is the driving force behind what begrudgingly passes for a story: boring dialogue, copy-paste lewdness, boring dialogue, copy-paste lewdness, over, and over, and over again.
Finally, there's the sound. Even if you were trying to get your rocks of to this, the sound effects are just so gross and moist that they would be very distracting indeed, accompanied by the awful music, which consists of annoying, bleepy 30-second jingles that loop constantly, so that I found myself reaching for a podcast after only 20 minutes.

Commander Babes is a truly staggeringly awful game, with unlikable characters, messy dialogue, disgusting sound, and downright evil premise. If you simply must play one of these games, there are better ones out there (Try Ladykiller In A Bind; it's great!). Otherwise, go play Mass Effect, and then watch some free internet p-rn.

FINAL SCORE: 0/10 first game played from Cherry Kiss Games and gotta say i had fun with it though got a little bored at the end because it felt like it was just draggin' on that point. overall i enjoy their games and hope they keep goin' so as for this game: cool chicks, an interesting premise, and decent amount of content... just, i understand why the games are like this but: why can't they be fully uncensored!? The game meshes pretty well and voice actors are super good at this, I really recommend this due to the voice acting alone. The art is beautiful, plus lots of achievements, scenes and the plot is so funny I can't lmao..
The dialogues of this game are so amusing, you must see them.

Plot: 10/10
Characters: 10/10.
Art: 10/10.
Sounds: 10/10

Overall: 10/10
Is this score biased? Yes, this game was so funny that I can't judge it without being biased.
Still great though, you won't regret it.

Also I swear to god I heard that voice somewhere before in anime or sth. 
Still can't figure out from which anime, if you know, please tell me in the comments. Short H VN. Censored scenes with a decent story attached. Can be skipped. Should take less then an hour to complete if you are strictly reading everything. art is not good as other Unlike other reviewers for this game, I am not an erudite scholar who normally reads classic masterpieces, so I thought the story was clever and extremely well done for this genre. The battle towards the end of the story was especially strong emotionally. I don‚Äôt recall having a game of this type elicit such emotion and tension.

Regarding the pacing in the story, some other Cherry Kiss games drag the H scenes out to the point of monotony, so it was pleasing to see that they reigned things in a bit with Commander Babes, although they are still quite lengthy.

The English was pretty good and I also recall three or four places where they mixed up Kenshin‚Äôs and Shingen‚Äôs names, which could happen in any language. Maybe even the original script was not completely proofed.

Graphics are good, although they do the ‚Äúcell phone‚Äù treatment to the CGs to stretch them from 4:3 to 16:9. I do wish they didn‚Äôt have mosaic censorship, but that is in reality only a minor complaint with this game. Most of the mosaic censorship was blotting out are the protagonists ‚Äúweapon,‚Äù so it is not that bad, all things considered. 

Overall, I consider this a strong entry in the genre. Recommended. This game for those who want to F-word Japanese warlords of the past. it's shit Despite having multiple problems I recommend this game mainly to those who seek hentai games and those who are passionate about history.

My favorite part is probably about the characters due to the contrasting personalities of both heroines. The main character however does not seem interesting or great who has problems to decide, driven only by his instincts which might lead to emotional traumas.

The story about two Sengoku generals who appear in modern times (and as women no less) is interesting and entertaining especially when their personalities are clashing with the changes they perceive. This is however not well enough exploited and we are stuck with lacking context and not enough time between the +18 scenes for which the story seems to have been sacrificed. Furthermore the story could have been more interesting if we could choose only one girl (which has been hinted in the game) but instead the main character is unable to proceed this and chooses for a polygamy. The game could have used the choice so that the main character reflects why polygamy is not a good ending and why such relations are harmful such as Ernest Hemingway has explored in his Garden of Eden novel. Sure, at the end they might look happy but it makes one wonder if they will keep this bliss in the future or if he has doomed them all. The corrupted nature of polygamy is instead left to be studied by the gamers/readers but I am affraid that their concern lies somewhere else, which is rather evident.

My review is a positive one but there is one point that has made me hesitating whether I should not rather write it off as a negative one. This point is the experimentation with the female identity which has been very badly explored. Instead of this we receive misogynistic comments from both the heroines and the main character. It is understandable that the heroines are from a women-unfriendly era and are thus accustomed of such views but the main character does not stress enough that women have as much potential as men (but that the current society is still trying to repulse). This has clashed with my expectations that sword-wielding women would prove to be a sign of equality in this game and instead it has been the first cause of misogynism. Furthermore it is much too simple and ridiculous that women can only attain happiness by becoming mothers and submissive to their partners which has been brought forth in a too direct and simple way in this visual novel. 

So I come to the conclusion that this visual novel has very badly exploited its themes but due to the originality of the concept I do recommend it to experience it once but not to be reread.

The devs ended the series out on a hard note. The first and second game served as an introduction to the genre, the third game showed the players how the devs had mastered it, and this one is for the player to show the game how they've mastered it. The most important change to this game is that halfway through they remove the rewind mechanic a lot of players have depended on for a while. Some are bitter, and may call this cheap.

I've enjoyed the entire series (which I started years ago and just finished part 4 today). I enjoyed the previous versions but this is the worst one. It's easy to get stuck, backtracking is often impossible, resources impossible to get at times. But the most frustrating thing is the designers decision to prevent backtracking making the game and unpleasant trial and error that kills all enthusiasm and interest. Pity really.

I havnt even played it because of that, which is kind of stupid since i played the other three books to its fullest (found the best possible outcomes).

Please dont support this franchise (and the ego developers from INKLE) Fantastic series of games. Thanks Jerma. Now I can finish watching all his playthroughs as well. What a lovely chap The rewind mechanic saved you from a LOT of BS and tedium in previous games. Getting rid of it makes the game an absolute slog.
To get the best ending, you have to spend some time in a permadeath-esque state, where you can either rewind to the point where you went into this state and lose your chance at the best ending, or start completely over. If enough of the aforementioned BS happens between starting permadeath and the final stretch of the game, you have to start the game over. That stretch of time between CAN be fairly short, but there are a lot of potential combat encounters and other opportunities to die even if you make a beeline.

Explore in different galaxy through space cracks. To find and gather useful resource, to trade and make money are all important to develop your own fleets. And only through build massive fleets, you triumph over the unknown evil forces.","good game but god it crashes SOO OFTEN!! i have to save so much to prevent losses, altogether i probably lost about 2.5 hours of play time to crashing Owned this game over a month now and haven't been able to play it. Apparently it only works on 1080p monitors and mine's a 1440p monitor. So, the buttons don't line up where they're supposed to. I've tried to work with the dev to resolve the issue but a month later it's not solved and I'm past the refund point now. The half hour I've spent in the game has just been searching for where I'm supposed to click to hit the buttons and sending screenshots to the dev, who appears to have given up on my issue and moved on.

Edit: It's been almost 2 months now. Still no fix for my issue. Also, the dev has responded to every negative comment except this one and hasn't replied to my discussion post in over a month. Seems like they want to just pretend my issue doesn't exist. I've also tested it on my second monitor, which is only 780p and it still has the same issue. The devs excuse for not being able to fix the issue was that they didn't have a 1440p monitor to test it on. Tutorial, UI and gfx gave me cancer I can't recommend this game, even at sale price.  It looks interesting, but my experience amounted to trying to figure out why the tutorial didn't present any actual information for a bit, thinking I was accidentally closing it somehow, then giving up on it and just starting to try to figure it out on my own and upgrade things for a while.  

The tutorial planet allowed me to interact with it, but there were two others I could see but not interact with.  I figured out I had to do planet upgrades to build more buildings.

The trade system makes no sense to me and seems to consist of a sailing ship landing on my planet and not being willing / able to buy resources I have in stock.

The UI offers no feedback or explanation beyond an error tone when you try to input commands that aren't allowed such as trying to conduct trades.  There are some explanatory windows on upgrades that explain roughly what things do, but it was all out of context and I had no real idea of what I was trying to accomplish except trying to progress toward something interesting happening which sadly I didn't encounter.  Eventually I unlocked a planet management building which essentially played the game for me and started building things I didn't find in my own exploration.

I played it for about half an hour and nothing really happened.  I am assuming at some point there will be some sort of enemy invasion, but I didn't have the patience to wait around for it to happen.

If this game were in early access, I'd probably be more willing to give it time, but as this is being presented as a finished game, I have to give it a negative because this is far too lacking in polish to be released in my opinion. Screenshots look interesting but tutorial is no bueno. Got as far as it explaining how to speed up time, then the instructions of what to do just stop?

Tried to play a game but without a tutorial it isn't intuitive, so refunded.

Also, somehow managed to get 46% of the achievements in 20 mins even although I had no idea what I was doing. a good game, interesting, and its old plus - you can create your own planet and play according to your own story, price -10/10, graphics - 8/10, plot - 10/10.
I advise everyone to play this game. The game draws you in from the first minutes, it's very interesting to explore all the planets and mechanics of the game. In addition, very beautiful graphics and drawing of planets. I recommend it to all lovers of economic strategies and space. Beautiful space and planet. Finally, the huge fleet defeated the BOSS.
The resource and factory speed can be adjusted a little faster.
Good game. Learning to survive in space. Travel in space. Explore different meteorites. You can build different types of buildings on your base. It's definitely worth playing. I love space. And I love strategy. Yes, and I am positive about simulators. And if you put everything together, it doesn't always work out well.
But in this case, we can say that it does not fail. Of course, it's a long way from the game of the year, but if the brother is counting that it's indie. That is very appropriate.
Pretty well shoved different chips from different games. There is of course a bit too much, in some moments, but everything is more or less harmonious.

790831,Valkyria Chronicles 4 - The Two Valkyria,dlc,False,"20 Nov, 2018","Action, RPG, Strategy",This cataclysmic reunion of the two Valkyria will determine Crymaria's fate.,"This was quite the fun DLC! 

The story of it is you can play as either of the Valkyrias in a battle against the other one. You have to play as either side to fully unlock and finish the story and can take some getting used to. Especially as they appear as classes you already known (Selvaria being a Scout and Crymaria being a Grenadier) but after you get to see their amazing power for yourself, blowing tanks apart and groups of soldiers with little-to-no effort, you then get granted them as playable units!

Yes, you can have Selvaria and Crymaria the Valkyria as units (using up two command points instead of one, just like the story you play them in) and even the two girls that served under Belgar. Nikola and Chiara along with two copies of their crossbows which are single-shot but deal more damage than even the highest researched rifle. They'll turn any mission into a cake-walk. Especially Selvaria who not only takes very little damage from enemy attacks, but has a potential where she just fully restores her hitpoints anyway, making her a Goddess on the battlefield! For fun I even tested them out and found that Walz's black tank couldn't even stand up to two of her beam blasts, not even aiming at the radiator! That's how OP these units are! So they're certainly a lot of fun. Especially if you just wanted to finish a mission quickly and were pissed off with it. I don't blame anyone for taking advantage of the girls here.

Speaking of taking advantage, to add to this when you unlock them as playable units, you also gain some very sexy clothing for them all. Almost as a reference back to the beach DLC. For both the Valkyrias and the two that served Belgar as his lapdogs.

So this DLC was certainly quite fun, if short and a little cheaty, but it is still fun and ultimately you are the one to decide if you want to bring them in on a mission or not. This is post-game content. Another Extra Story with a two missions, and a bunch of character unlocks.

[spoiler]The two missions have you play as the comically overpowered Selvaria and Crymaria during a duel from two perspectives. You also get to use an Imperial Squad and a X-O squad to support them, but they do not really have any flavour. After finishing the Extra Story you get the two Valkyria along with Belgar's two agents added to Squad-E for use in any other mission - along with swimsuits for all of them.[/spoiler] ‚†Ä Fine map, okey story, great characters to use on the missions.
Also, it is kinda funny that faceless soldiers have names but in the Minerva's Squad Stories they don't even have names. Buy one and you get 2 waifu who will win the battle for you . 10/10 i will sacrifice half of my platoon for bikini again 965284 The characters it adds are so OP it makes getting A ranks across the board almost trivial should you decide to use them.  You get two Dunkles on top of the two permanently equipped on Nikola and Chiara which are great scout rifles. The units you get from this are ridiculously OP and the extra missions are kinda meh. They laughably try to balance the units by making them use 2 CP instead of one (like tanks in VC1), but just having them stand there is already OP as they take damage like nobody's business and shoot at anything wandering by. You can also tell the enemy AI have no idea how to deal with them, usually shooting them first like theyre random units standing in the middle of nowhere. Honestly, making them not able to take cover probably makes them more powerful because then maybe the enemy would aim for a less defended unit if they were crouched. And the CP cost would need to be something like 4 rather than 2 to even begin to balance.

Basically, this is cheat mode for 5 bucks. On console, I could maybe get behind that. But on PC? Just go download a trainer from MrAntiFun if you want to cheat. Nice to finally be on the other end of the magic ragnite steamroll everything stick....",0.14077380952380947

Good for mid skilled achievement hunters
 Garbage part 2 There is a bit of up and down in difficulty, and has some issues with controls in different parts, but overall a quick, fun game. 6/10 This second part has actually made improvements. The levels are now challenging and achievable, increasing it from 12 levels to 30. It also doesn't have unnecessary 1000+ achievements. About one hour of playtime to unlock all of the achievements in this one. I would still suggest to buy this only when it's on sale. This game was a lot better than the first, however there are still some levels where you cannot complete the level if your graphics is wrong. Other than that this game was quite easy and can be completed within 1 hour. This game thoroughly tests your skills and reaction time. With 30 increasingly challenging levels, you'll face hardcore trouble by level 25. However, with effective management, it's possible to overcome. Ideal for achievement hunters with intermediate skills. 3D Hardcore Cube 2 likes to incorporate all the levels from the first one into this game for a total of thirty levels.  After painfully restarting multiple times; my death counter closed in around five hundred.  There are a few levels that require precise jumping and timing to pass the level.  Overall this one is better because you can change the color of the white cubes in the background.  The physics are a bit more different in this game when moving, but the same bugs and glitches can be encountered.  Rate 7/10 based on difficulty, length and improvement of physics which slightly altered the RNG (random number generator) which still caused a bunch of unnecessary deaths.  The achievements in this game can be unlocked in one play through for 100% completion. ""New physics"" as related to the previous version of this title means ""we made parabolic jump faster"".
Apart from that, this is exactly the same bugged game. Getting stuck on a flat surface or getting thrown into a terrain cube (need to force-restart to unstuck) happens so often.
This game is hard, because you have to challenge bugs, as well as physics and logic that are totally different not only from reality, but a common gaming sense.",-0.008750382614018979

Pity that the dev didn't exploit the open world aspect some more; we tend to get only a single quest at once, most of the time. Hopefully, there'll be more side-quests in later versions.

One thing I like a lot about this game is that it's not one of them regular fuckfest games, which there are only too many of already; this game has an actual story and objective. It's a bit difficult to master, especially when facing many enemies, what bugs me it's the art and the language change fails to update during certain character conversations, has potential but need some more work to be worth it, I'll have to go with a 2/5. Art is kinda bad, clipping issues when 'interacting'. Some weird cell shading that gets annoying, and the character walks to the left of where you point to go so it gets disorientating over time.

my favourite is the hands that glow with thousand suns, and they just make the picture vibrate. there should be a disclaimer about this in the intro section, or the glow should be lowered.

also not sure why does the mouse have filtering on, locks onto stuff randomly, and changes to 2x value during sprint.

cannot change binds? in 2025? dude this isnt a free jam game, you are asking real money for this.

someone should have tested the game before release. i think im gonna refund this.
 Good game but needs a few pieces to make it perfect. Beautiful visuals and great gameplay other than the below things to be honest. 

1. Needs a sprint toggle, my pinky hurt from this.
2. Add a prompt to the journals to close them. I had to slam my keyboard to find the button because it did not say ""press ___ to close""

Honestly my only MAIN gripe is #1 it is frustrating to have to hold sprint for a platformer like this. yes, yes, very good Very good game! 

Graphics 8/10
Music 8/10
Gameplay and Level Design 9/10

It's a challenging first person platformer that gets progressively harder, but it's a joy to play because the controls are very good and it's satisfying to complete the hard parts. The game plays very well with a PS4 controller, I think I played 90% of the game with the controller, and 10% with mouse/KB (There are some very hard parts you need precision through laser tunnels and it's next to impossible trying to do it with the controller).

 I beat the game in 9 hours, I would gladly play much more! I hope for a Soul Drifter 2.

A couple of observations:

-I wished the devs worked a bit more on the lore, there are some datalogs you find in your path, but very few so the game doesn't have much of a story, and some of the logs had the exact same entry so that was a bit sloppy. 

-The ending is quite bad, you just enter a room and pull a lever, the screen goes all black and there are some explosions noises and the game ends. not a good ending for such a great game, I hope the devs work on that and update the game with a better ending

-ACHIEVEMENTS! The game does not have achievements, so there is no replay value. I don't see myself coming back to it if there is no new challenges to overcome. The game reaches a really nice flow state, feels really good when you figure out a section. souldrifter is a fun game with a unique world that lets you slide into the flow of playing thanks to the meditative and relaxed music and the beautiful world. A first person jump and run (and glide) game.
I like that the environment looks like it is underwater but is not underwater in the same time. 
The Sound is also nice.

The jump and run parts are not to hard and not to easy. 
I died a reasonable amount of times in each passage i think :D
Have not finished it yet thoo.

Nice little game.

What bad things can i say?
Well sometimes there was yellow text shown in front of a yellow background that made it a little hard to read but thats a very minor issue. Awesome game, really enjoying it so far. Very atmospheric design. Loved the mix between the magical landscapes and abandoned industrial areas. It's giving you an eerie feeling, which is also nicely supported by the stories around this beautiful worldbuilding. Good balance between casual platforming areas and some that are a little more of a challenge, but always managable without getting too frustrating. Great game. If you're into platformers don't miss out on this! Wonderful plattformer in a beautiful but strange world. Very nice level design and art. You'll definitely have fun with it and get into a good flow.

This was a fantastic game! It was so wholesome and I would play it again! It had a nice story and was exciting, too. [h1]Review with accompanying screenshots and videos in Sinical Network[/h1]
https://www.sinicalanimenetwork.com/post/lighthouse-of-guiding-flames-quick-thoughts

[i]Lighthouse of guiding flames[/i] is a fantasy visual novel with mystery and horror elements. It features the female protagonist Ethani who, over the course of 12 days, tells her story where she is chosen as a human sacrifice to appease a vengeful god in her remote village, goes to a lighthouse run by the keeper Astaban, meets a few people, and moves on in her life (or afterlife).

The story starts off slow at first as it recounts Ethani's story backwards from day 12 to 1. Then it gets better in the second part where her story is told from day 1 to day 12, and the player gets to choose various dialogue options leading to several different endings. I like the part where each choice towards a specific route has a special colour to help players reach that ending (yellow for run away, orange for fight, and red for accept fate). There also is a compass icon that will show the player's inclination towards a particular route and ending. And finally there is a published community guide to help players get all endings and achievements. In terms of artwork, it has a variety of nice, cute, and spooky CGs. The background music is good and appropriate for most of the scenes. I especially like [i]Timeless shore, Endless minute[/i], and [i]Guiding flame[/i] for the fantasy themes, as well as [i]I'll save you[/i] during the good endings as they feel rewarding.

There are a few cons though. I have come across a number of spelling errors during my playthrough in which some of them completely change the meaning, which detracts from the experience, although some of the patch note announcements have reported that the developer and translators are fixing them. In addition, none of the endings truly feel satisfying in the sense that there is no perfect ending. The hardest ending and achievement [i]Persistence Lights the Way[/i] can be difficult to figure out without referring to the guide, and it feels more disappointing than satisfying after attempting multiple playthroughs of the game.

Lastly, I purchased the soundtrack DLC on Steam but was disappointed to receive a blank folder and Steam music player wouldn't play any of the BGM. Hopefully, the developer can address this major fault sometime in the future.

After spending around 3 hours to get all endings and achievements, [i]Lighthouse of guiding flames[/i] is an interesting supernatural visual novel with plenty of background music and artwork at a reasonable price, although with a few faults. Therefore, I can recommend this game when it is at a discount to be more proportional to the playing time, or when the English translation is improved. With that being said, I do not recommend buying the soundtrack DLC on Steam until this major fault is addressed.

[h1]Recent updates[/h1]
The developer has patched the game on July 2022 and June 2024 to improve the English subtitles and make the soundtracks available again to those who purchased the soundtrack DLC on Steam.

https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Sinical A surprisingly interesting little VN that offered something I don't typically get from VNs this size. A good, unique story that doesn't overstay its welcome. Only downside is this VN could REALLY use a copyeditor - the writing overall is good and competent, but there are tons of syntax errors ('and' is 'abd', 'a lot' becomes 'al ot', etc) that a copyeditor would catch. Doesn't hinder the story, but does take a layer of polish away from an otherwise hidden gem! I've been wanting to buy this game for a long one, and I honestly should've done that sooner. Despite a high number of spelling and grammatical errors, I can't complain about anything else. An interesting tale with an unconventional narrative, it can easily pull you into the disparaging situation that the main character faces. An enjoyable visual novel about a girl trying to do what's right versus what's expected of her. The characters are pleasing to look at, the chibi CGs are cute and there are plenty of great CGs as well. Definitely make sure to read it forwards after reading it backwards to fill in a lot of holes.

Beware that there are a lot of typos here. If I had to guess on average, there are 1-2 per 10-15 screens. It's not enough to really distract you from the story, but it is quite annoying to see just how many there are. This game was a nice surprise. With lower budget Indie Visual Novels, you never really know what to expect. Lighthouse is a charming title, with lovely music, some wonderful artwork and a compelling narrative. This should only take you about 5 or 6 hours to complete, but I left feeling completely satisfied.

The characters are delightful and there are some fun and silly scenes, but also a darker plot that slowly comes to light, as well as multiple endings that are all pretty in depth. The world feels deeper than I‚Äôd expect from a short title like this, and I think there‚Äôs plenty of material left for a sequel.

The first time you play the game, you actually go through the story in reverse, one day at a time, starting on Day 12, and then 11, etc. This is an unusual and memorable way to begin the narrative, but it works, and when you reach the end‚Ä¶. Or the beginning in this case, you can then play the game in the proper order. Now you‚Äôre able to make choices, see more detailed renditions of events, and send the story in different directions.

The main problem I had with this release is the grammar. The writing is actually very good, it flows well and the characters are interesting. But there are tons and tons of spelling and grammatical errors. I don‚Äôt know if there were time constraints, but it definitely felt like someone was in a hurry at some point during the localization process. But to me, the other aspects of the game more than make up for it.  
 Young Ethani finds herself washed up on unfamiliar shore. There is a Lighthouse, a beacon for those who have lost their way, its Keeper tells her. What happened to Ethani? And will she find her way after leaving this mystical place?

[h1]I liked...[/h1]
[list]
[*] The concept (the story is first told backwards as a kinetic novel, and then from the beginning, where the player can try and reach a better outcome‚ÄîI really enjoyed that)
[*] The choices (Ethani has some tough decisions to make, which keep the story interesting; also the game overall is easy to navigate, since you can see in which direction each choice leads)
[*] The characters
[*] The art and music[/list]

[h1]I didn't care for...[/h1]
[list]
[*] The tonal shifts (at times, the game drops into chibi comedic scenes or grimdark tragic teritorry, with little subtlety)
[*] The leaps of logic (a few plot points just don't feel very realistic, in my opinion)[/list]

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
The melancholic [i]Lighthouse of Guiding Flames[/i] is not the perfect visual novel, but it's an interesting one. The story can take you in very different directions depending on what choices you make, and some flaws of the plot do not take away from the message or overall experience. Recommended.

[i]For more EVN reviews, feel free to look at my curator page: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34616763-Azar-Reviews/]Azar Reviews[/url].[/i] This review contain some spoilers. Because it hard to told about game without spoil it main feature. 
In short this a dark fairytale about family, responsibility, homicide, religious conscience of different culture and a lot of tasty tea.

A bit longer:

Story itself is pretty simple. But the strongest part of this game is how it is told. After you will think about how this game ending is short and edgy, story will really start and turn the tables about your perception of characters. Not about Asteban, tho. He is the only constant in this world along with his magic Lighthouse.

You should definitely try it.

Wir wollen doch alle nur chillen und spielen, ersparen wir den anderen den Stress mit unseren Hinweisen. W√ºnsche allen nur das Beste DA2 has a fair bit of content to add to the game to make it better, Legacy and the Exiled Prince alone are two fantastic additions, Legacy adding a bunch of Grey Warden stuff and lore, and introducing a very interesting villain to the series, and Exiled Prince adds an extra companion named Sebastian. He's one of my favourite characters in the game, though very much the DA2 version of Sera, a lot of people super hate him and a lot of people super like him, it's a swing!

Mark of the Assassin is.. alright. The story I thought was interesting, and it had some puzzles to work through that weren't too terrible, and you do get a fun cameo from Origins before Bioware butchered his character in Trespasser. The companion you get for the dlc though Talis is uh.. okay, I guess? I liked the idea of the character, but the execution Bioware played out with her never really hit the mark in my eyes. do NOT play mark of the assassin it is a hideous dlc. legacy is good but mark of the assassin is such a tumor on my game now that i have to leave the review as negative. Absolutely crazy that I couldn't finish Origins due to the insane crashing and I can't finish Dragon Age II with DLC content because they're unauthorized. I've tried a lot including logging into my EA account, logging out then back in, uninstalling and reinstalling the game, syncing on DA Keep, nothing worked. DAI is the only functional game, but that could be because I played on PlayStation instead of through Steam/EA. I might just have to abandon these earlier games and jump over to Veilguard which is unfortunate because I was enjoying these (DLCs broke in Act 3 and my loads became unloadable).",0.0545793650793651

Great game, have been waiting for its release for awhile and has exceeded my expectations, easy to learn/simple programming that results in crucial changes to how the bots handle a situation, really fun, especially good if you want to start learning programming or as a fun way to use your knowledge for the programmers out there

Conclusion: Buy it. Worth. Fun! My brain feels bigger and seems to have more folds since I started playing! If you enjoy logic puzzles you'll enjoy this. It's a perfect sandbox to be able to see [on a basic level] what goes into logic of computer-controlled characters in video games. There are simple logic blocks to start with, and advanced ones that can create a very 'intelligent' DumbBot. Have you ever had a dream where the MCP from TRON zapped you into the computer, but instead of playing games to survive you had to tell the other programs how to play the games? And you were actually Neo from The Matrix and were really good at it?

No? Just me?

Anyway, long story short, this game is literally a dream come true.

EDIT: After having played a few more hours I would like to add that the music and general atmosphere is great, and that if you like any of the other programming games on Steam you will probably like this game as well.

Rather than a puzzle game, this is a problem-solving game. There are always multiple correct solutions, even in most of the tutorial levels. But some solutions are more efficient than others. Some solutions are cooler than others. Some solutions allow you to win just in the nick of time. 

Instead of abstract visualizations, you get cool action scenes and can usually tell when your program went horribly wrong or triumphantly right. Waiting for an interpreter to step through all the cycles in a test case is fine, but watching your little dudes triumph over each challenge by doing what you told them to do is just that much more spectacular.

There is no linear ""main campaign"", but a large variety of levels to beat, grouped into various categories. The first level of a category is usually the easiest, but you can tackle them in any order. If you get tired of survival, try a heist. If you get tired of heists, try a deathmatch. Beat all the levels? Open up the scenario editor and make one of your own.",0.20603956228956224

This is barely a puzzle and barely needs strategic thinking. But it's completely open. You can solve levels in many ways. More to say, you can try to solve it the same way many times and sometimes you will succeed and other time - not. Because units make a lot of random and position-based decisions. It feels like you playing cellular automata, that's what I like here. And that's the only reason to play. It is cheap as a dirt. Easy, funny, casual. So, if you like such things, you can buy it. Just wait for a sale.
But if you are not into random mechanics and self-oscillations - do not. Because:
- Units are pinpoint small and you will need to click them
- Music is inappropriate
- No zombie sounds, no any sounds. And this is a huge problem.
- It feels like completely DIY
- It is short. But you will not ask for more

So, I vote up, this is my decision. But you better avoid it. This is a waste of your money dont buy it 60 levels for 49 cents (on sale) you can't go wrong.

This is it. This application makes animating fun again and is seriously underrated. The very fact you can skip the control creation process and instead directly animating on the models is a god send. I stopped using maya or blender for animation creation and i use this exclusively for my 3d animation needs for my game projects. Its ideal for organic animations like character and creature animation creation. The only con currently is the limitation of modifying the curves of the rotations. The flexibility of modifying the graph curves for locomotion is not present in rotation. Other than that it is fantastic. Love it! Just love it!! Finally a tool focusing JUST on animating....Fresh and focused but deep enough to get serious work done! Awesome tool for animation. It is entirely focused on rigging and animating and making it as seamless as possible. I was able to speed up my production pipeline a LOT! The rigging process is very simple and effective. The same with the animation.
I think it needs some more tools for facial animations, but i was able to work it out with the current tools.

I encountered no bugs in my short play time, I'll probably put another hour into it just out of curiosity. 

The problems are simple:

1) Lack of updates
2) Lack of explanations about what's currently in the game, how to properly structure quests, events, etc.
3) Lack of information from the dev.

It's obvious that this is a solo dev or small team and normally I'd hold off on the negative with that in mind. But I've owned it a year and there's been nothing done in that time that I can see so it's most likely a dead project. Seems like an awesome idea and seems like it was off to a solid start so I'm not sure why it hasn't improved. Time, money, health, who knows, but there isn't enough here to justify buying it at any price without some signs of life from the developer. He responded to other reviews so maybe he'll respond here. If it gets updated I'll be more than happy to review it again at that time. This review should hopefully serve to enlighten those on the fence about this game; as has been mentioned before it is hard to figure out what this game is without actually playing it. I also would point out that this review is not a hard pass, as there is limited potential, I suppose.

TL;DR: Gameplay is shallow and repetitive, with no reason to care about anything in the world. All you do is place cards to level up to unlock more cards to place, and ultimately for what purpose? The game doesn't say.

In depth review below:

As one reviewer stated, there is hardly any gameplay to speak of here; the entirety of the gameplay is as follows: You start off with a hand of cards and a small portion of the map revealed, which you can place on locations for adventurers to complete. By successfully completing said cards the adventurers will gain gold and gems for you that fill 2 bars, when these bars are filled you can click them to level up; each time you do so you get to pick 1 of 3 cards to unlock. The stragegy aspect, if you could call it that, is that once your hand is depleted you have to pay gold to draw more cards, either a full hand or one by one, thus lowering the gold bar. 

Cards range from +1 cards such as location or adventurers which allow you to summon additional adventurers or unlock additional locations on the map, monster cards for your adventurers to fight, tasks for your adventurers to do, a +time bonus to extend the timer of the cards you put down, a rarity type to change the rarity, and a class type to match it to a specific class. There are also bigger chained quests that you can place on towns, each quest has slots for the location (which can only be placed on its specific location) an event, like Pirates or the like, a class slot, and a time bonus slot. Below these slots you can place as many cards, such as challenges or monsters, as you want. There seems to be a cost associated with this, but I couldn't swear to it, and the more cards the more difficult the quest and the greater reward.

These quests also have a timer, but you activate it when you are ready to do so, as with every other quest the adventurers will either do them or they won't, and other than matching a certain class with what you put down you have no control over this whatsoever. There are also specific story quests which require specific cards to complete, you then play whatever cards don't need to be saved while gathering the cards you do need; once you have  them you assemble the quest, click the timer, and hope for the best; as before they will either do them or they won't; if they can't complete said quest (or don't bother to) and the time expires, then you get to do it all over again until they succeed. It is also worth noting on these chained quests that once a card is added to it, it CANNOT be removed, and until the quest runs its course you will never draw said cards again unless you have multiple copies. So if you accidently place a card down on one of these quests, or change your mind at any time, tough luck, although these quests can also be dismissed if you so choose.

The biggest flaw that I see is that due to the lack of interaction with the world, there is plenty of information provided about things, but no reason to care. Towns give vague information and list things such as trainable skills and the goods they have, the adventurers list character traits and attributes and weapons, but there is no reason to care in the slightest about any of that because ultimately it doesn't really mean anything. The location of where you place cards doesn't really matter, I assume it might as you unlock more of the map if you wanted to try to entice a particular character to do a particular quest for some reason, as then you'd place it close to them, but other than that it doesn't really matter.

Adventurers can be renamed, which is a nice touch, but honestly I couldn't be bothered to care about whatever their name was in the first place, let alone come up with a new one. They can also form opinions of other adventurers, which is meaningless other than just to be there. The crux of the game is this; loads of meaningless information that is just there to be there. There is no reason to care about any of it, those I suppose these small details are a nice touch as well as far as fleshing out the world.

Ultimately my time in the game ( which was all spent in the tutorial, mind you) consisted of playing cards at random, just willy nilly, and not giving two shits if the adventurers completed them or not. If I had a class modifier or a rarity modifier I used it, and if I had a location I would just pile them on the chained quest. Ultimately I had to quit because of a bug of some sort that has caused the game to crash upon reloading my save, but I was stuck anyways due to be poorly given directions; there is a quest in which all it says is ""Find a way to cause your adventurers to pass your hardest quest yet"", and the few times I initiated the quest after gathering the requisite cards, they largely ignored it all together, and when they did try they failed it, but I was not clear in what way they had failed; it might be their stats weren't high enough, therefore I think I needed to use some of the required cards and use them to get their stats up, and then attempt it when I thought they were ready. Not that I really felt the motivation to do that; like I said I couldn't be bothered to care if they succeeded or not, as all I would have gotten for my troubles anyways would be more cards to put down randomly to see if they did them or not. Ultimately what little gameplay there is is very repetitive; to be honest I don't have a problem with that, however, what is the point? Do I just play cards and level up endlessly until I get bored? Is there some ultimate endgame goal to strive for, or do I win once I reace a certain level, or what? The game does not expain what the ultimate point of the game is, it just says that the bigger quests tell a story, but let me tell you, english is clearly not this guys first language, so often times it is hard to make sense of what he is even saying.

There is also a sandbox mode where apparantly you play with everything already unlocked from the get go, which sounds even more pointless to me, because unlocking cards by leveling up is all there is to do in this game. Play cards to level up to unlock more cards to play to level up more, to unlock even MORE cards to play, but for what?

Given that if I were to continue to play I would have to start over again, that is a no for me, and I have since requested a refund. I would consider repurchasing this again, but NOT at full price; if you charge a premium price, I expect a premium product. This is not.

A word of advice to the developers concerning the level up bars, there needs to be better feedback than just flashing when it is time to level up; far too often I had filled the bars and didn't realize it, causing me to waste my time, unless the gold and gems you earn after that point carry over (I couldn't tell). If they don't, they should. Perhaps a non-intrusive sound effect would be nice. From the screenshots I couldn't tell what's the gameplay about, but given they wrote ""Magus is a unique RPG simulation, bringing you the ultimate role to play in RPG games: The Game Master"", I thought it would be similar to a Dungeon Keeper game.

However, it's barely an RPG and barely a card playing game. User interaction is limited to placing cards onto the playfield (cities and locations on the map), and that's it, literally. Then it turns into a waiting game where you look at giant men running around a huge map from location to location and ""completing quests"", then you get more cards to put on the playfield.. 

There is also a fog of war, even though you don't have an opponent or any reason to worry about not getting information from a region. 

In all game modes you are going to be spending time looking on a big empty map, there are no battles to be fought, no cities to explore, nothing, you control nothing, neither a unit like in a HoMM game, nor a single character, and you can't manage anything other than which card to put on the screen. 

-sidenote, AFAIK, MAGUS is played with dice, not cards, and in this version you are being told that there is a diceroll, but just as with everything else, you have no say in it, not even a dice roll animation or anything -

I can't recommend it, actually I would advise everyone to wait until the game is out of EA, because as it is now, there is barely anything in it to play with. It's also hard to look at, the art style and the presentation is dull and repetitive, it's basically a handful of assets all around a huge terrain.

But, if you love reading, there is plenty of text about cities, with generic information like how much fish they have and info on Economy, Army and whatnot (not that it's relevant, since you don't know what those mean, and there is no way you can interact with the cities other than placing cards on them).

It would be also nice to get gameplay videos from the devs because it is really really hard to know what you are getting into right now.

For those who would like to play card games, Gwent and Heartstone are out and free, for DM roleplaying, you are better off with War for the Overworld or, you know, Dungeon Keeper. Edit #1: There is a bug reporting window now, so thats a step forward.


Can't say I would reccomend this game for a good deal of reasons.

1: The tutorial doesn't explain what everything does and why you need to do it.
     - Don't even get me started on all the typos and grammar issues either.
2: You can literally get adventurers that deal no damage to monsters, thus making them unable to deal with monsters at all.
     - This means they can't kill monsters you place down whatsoever, making monster cards unuseable.
3: Quests have a habit of breaking and getting stuck on a 0 timer. 
     -  The dismiss button is nice and all but if it doesn't get rid of bugged quests that are stuck on a zero timer, there isn't much you can do but restart the game with a new save or give up on that area slot completely. Not to mention that you won't be able to use any of the cards in that bugged quest ever again in that save unless you get another copy of it. [b]This is game breaking.[/b]
4: Heroes will permanently stop moving if you don't place down quests for them constantly.
     -  This is also game breaking. If your heroes don't do quests you can't progress in the game.
5: There isn't a whole lot of flavor to this game yet. So far it is the same thing no matter what areas you unlock or where your heroes go.
     -   You unlock random cards by leveling through a sort of random lottery system> You place those cards down on the map and start the timer for them> Heroes then attempt them or ignore them if they think that it's too hard for them> Then you rinse and repeat this for the entire game. There is nothing else. It's litterally a clicker game.
6: You have to follow quest requirements to the letter in this game.
     -   If it says you need particular cards and you don't have them or roll them in the slots on level up you're screwed untill you do. This causes uneccessary grinding for cards.


Listen Devs. If you want this to be a fun game you need to do some things.

- Make progression fun and less repetitive. This can be done with a simple skill tree that always unlocks cards upon reaching a certain level. You can also allow players to upgrade the base rarity type of a card by spending gold instead of using rarity cards. Then, make those rarity cards into effect cards that chang the attributes of the cards they are attatched to. (Think auto healing a hero after an objective is completed, or giving hereos item drops.) Don't forget that combining cards to get new and/or better cards should also be an option.

- Get rid of hardline objectives and make them more freeform. There was nothing more annoying besides the bugs in this game than having to follow cookie cutter instructions about what quests I should make. This can be done by giving out quests that try to get you to achieve a resource goal for a quest instead of forcing players to use specific cards. Even just allowing players to use more cards that weren't listed on the quest requirements would be nice.

- Obviously, fix the bugs that people find! Give people a way to report them when they find them too! Not a good game... tutorial needs a lot of work. Doesn't explain things clearly enough.",0.010338722241377097

The main thing is that despite saying in stats that it does more damage than the bow, when I get a solid body shot the standard guys don't die. If the only way to consistently get silent kills with it is to use gas arrows then i should just use the bow cause it gets 10 more of each arrow. Whats the point off a crossbow so weak a bow beats it. It could be forgiven if it was a sidearm but it's a secondary weapon. From what I read in other reviews it might have been a one shot kill when first released but now it's pointless.
Crossbow Carnage, more like Crossbow Calamity. I bought the Crossbow Carnage Weapons Pack on sale.  At first I did not like using the crossbow.  However, I told myself that I would stick with it for a few region(s) play-through.  I'm glad that I did.  The Crossbow has become one of my all time favorites.  I can take out an entire squad without much effort and in short time.  Love it!  Just takes time to get use to, like anything else. Actually pretty cool weapon pack! I wish the crossbow was a bit more satisfying to use but overall its pretty fun. Sniper looks cool and the revolver is pretty sick avoid. 

sniper isn't anything special

pistol can't be suppressed so it's just a novelty

and while the crossbow is nice for the special ammo, it's extremely inconsistent in terms of its damage. even though the damage bar is maxed out, it struggles to consistently kill enemies in the torso at ~20 meters. there's also horrible trigger delay where the bolt doesn't fire until 0.2-0.3 seconds after you click your mouse. 

if you need the special ammo just buy the bow with in game cash. Crossbow is great, I've mainly used the gas bolts as another alternative to get rid of heavies early game, and the Car_K8 never leaves my side, silenced mid range AR is a definite for my play style.

The sniper is decent for a light with a nice spread of special ammo, not tried the revolver as i prefer silenced weapons, overall well worth the ¬£2.89 i paid on sale The crossbow in this DLC seems buggy. I cannot get reliable performance out of it except at point blank range. I expected to be able to get out to 100m with it using Kentucky Windage adjustments. Sadly, unlike the bow, I cannot depend on the results. The bow however is sweet and you quickly get a feel for its reach and limitations.

The 550-TRV is a nice, quick moving, .308 with a deep bass note to the suppressor. Nice addition to the light sniper rifles.

 I have not used the rest of the weapons from this pack so I cannot help you out there.

I've got mixed feelings about this DLC. Since the crossbow is the main focus of the pack I cannot recommend it. If however you want the 550 then I'd say get it. SILENT HUNTER CROSSBOW: Silent but it shoots very slow. It¬¥s ok but not the most efficient weapon.

550_TRV: A very good light sniper. Good at short range.

CAR_K8: It¬¥s very good in combination with a silencer. 

 MAD SHERIFF 9: Not the best weapon for stealth. But it looks cool. crossbow doesn't go through helmets (not tying to go off reality but damage) and rifle grabs enemy attention way better than my pistol or even my sniper guess i'm going back to the o'l silenced shotgun for stealth. Defiantly worthwhile to pick up, the Revolver is a really handy little guy while the Crossbow delivers a strong alternative to the Bow. The Assault rifle is well placed in recoil and sports a handy fast mag along with a silencer to keep you in the shadows without creating too many gaps in your armour should you get in a tough situation.

My only gripe is the Sniper. It is a nice little trinket, but doesn't really provide a strong feel to its light counterparts.
For anyone wondering, it contains Tagging, EMP, and Lure. It's an amazing Utility rifle, that's for sure. But that's as far as it can really stand. cant find crossbow dlc in game

1074700,Witches' Legacy: The Charleston Curse Collector's Edition,game,False,"3 May, 2019","Adventure, Casual",End the Charleston Curse before it wipes out an entire family and save a young girl in Witches‚Äô Legacy: The Charleston Curse!,"Variety Another 4:3 stretched to 16:9 with dismal results. It feels like the game file is inflated to over 1 Gb to appear the size of a more modern game. It sure doesn't appear in the graphics quality. And it uses a live action character amid all the animation. it always looks so tacky.  The interface has about 20% of the functionality of a modern game. Don't bother even on sale. The other games in this series are amazing, but this one sucks and isn't that great. The hidden objects blend together and overall the game lacks the fun that exist in the other ones. 5 stars Yes, this is an older game. No morphing objects, no collectibles, no fast track map (no map at all actually). That said, if you like HOGs you'll like this one! The scenes (art) are wonderfully drawn and the music is suitably creepy as you progress through the even creepier story. The HO scenes--there's a lot--are very well hidden and take careful observation. You will have to do a lot of backtracking as you earn items used to to unlock things in various rooms, but that's part of the charm imo (You can use the hint button to quickly go from room to room to where your next task is, which is very helpful). I have always appreciated these older games and this one is up near the top!.

EDIT: I am playing the next game in the series (Witches Legacy, Lair of the Witch Queen) and I can tell you it's been updated with morphing objects, puzzle pieces, a fast track map and even an imp who helps with tasks. The story continues--not nearly as creepy--following basically the same format. There are a lot more games to play in this series and I see no reason not to continue--they are entertaining at the least! The first game of Witches' Legacy series, was released in 2012. The story starts off with you discovering you are the only living family of an orphan girl named Lynn, your Charlestons family was killed off by a witch which you must save the young orphan from. The gameplay is like any classic HOG filled with multiple hidden object scenes that are recycled even if you took the item in the previous search.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2922441629

The artwork is still beautiful, although there are some live-acton cutscenes that look cheap and dated, but it is still an excellent game to play if you enjoy old HOGs. The main menu theme music is still as eerie as I remember, I love it, and enjoyed the soundtracks of the game.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2922443820

There is a bonus chapter that gives a good addition to the main story, Lynn will be the main character of the rest of the series. I wished the game has achievements or an option to download the soundtracks. The journal looked so good, it gives a good insight into the story and when you collect the pieces of paper, it will give you a clue of what you should do to some of the puzzles. Speaking of the puzzles, they were nice and some of them are unique. None of them is difficult though.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2520127687

Pros:
+Very nice soundtracks.
+Beautiful graphics.
+Creepy and very interesting story
+OK voiceovers.
+Very beautiful and helpful journal.

Cons:
-No steam achievements. 
-No fast traveling map.
-Dated-looking live-action cutscenes.

I recommend it to people who enjoy classic HOGs and don't get bored with the multiple hidden object scenes they'll encounter.

 This version of the song ""Blow Me Away"" is what put Breaking Benjamin on hiatus and led to the eventual firing of the other band members. The original is better in every way. This is a badly mixed version that technically shouldn't even legally exist because Ben Burnley didn't release the rights to his vocals for this mix. I didn't realize that this was the Valora version until post-purchase. I don't want money back as much as I want the original song instead. I love the original version of this song as I first heard it playing Halo 2 over a decade ago as a kid. I'd never heard the Valora version and I have no idea why Rocksmith felt this version was in any way shape or form better; because it's not. Valora (if that's her name) is a shitty singer who comes in at crutial moments when a deep voice is necessary and instead replaces it with her high pitched pop-style singing. All the lyrics about anger, rage, and etc are sung by her and it's so wrong that it's almost laughable. I suggest you listen to this song before you buy it; and please Rocksmith give us the original - REAL - version of this song.",0.08113636363636363

Idk its cheap and its literally what most scp 087 games are, walking down a staircase for five minutes. kinda sucks for 5 bucks, would be better if f2p honestly its not worth it. the ""game"" is actually well done. you will notice I put game in quotation marks. that's because this isn't a game. it's a demo, or a proof of concept. at floor 32 you encounter the face and the game ends whether your light is on or off, whether you are looking in it's direction or not. the game mechanic of having a battery for the flash light is pointless as you will reach the face long before it runs out, and that is unfortunate because it would effectively add tension to the game if this was a game. there are the beginnings of a good tension based survival horror game here. I do not recommend this game because they are charging for it and in my opinion they should not be. My god is it boring, worse than the free version from years ago. this game gives me a lot of happiness,it let know that even if i am disabled,i should be brave to go down the stairs,and also let me know what shit feels to go down the stairs ten minutes,i still hope the game is finished soon! [h1] NOT WORTH THE SPACE ON YOUR HARD DRIVE [/h1]

The game seemed interesting, so I purchased it when it was on sale.  I was dead wrong.  Played it the other night and after about 5 minutes of movie footage with miserable audio, I was graced by being allowed to walk down flights of stairs.  No Running, no jumping, just walking along very slowly.  The walking gets incredibly tedious after about 6 minutes, but just before you are about to exit the game...something happens to keep you sucked in.  You're enticed after finally seeing something that pulls you right back in, but all for naught.  

If you've read this far and would like to have the entire game described, keep reading.  [b] WARNING: SPOILERS [/b]

[spoiler]  Once you start walking down stairs and....nothing happens for about 6 minutes.  There is some incredibly uninteresting chatter between your character and someone on the other end(presumably the guy from the movie sequences) who tells you to keep going.  Eventually, you start to see a shadow of a generic person every other flight, and then you hear a baby crying off in the distance. The atmosphere is now really thick and you're all eyes and ears, just waiting for things to start to really happen.  [i] What is this shadow and why does it seem to be following me?  Why is there a baby down here, and why is it crying? [/i]  You keep going and eventually, stop caring about the shadow as it does nothing but run away whenever you get close to it. After about 16-20 minutes TOTAL GAME TIME, you are confronted with the stairs trailing off into nothing with a barely visible face staring at you from the dark.  Your character talks about it being creepy and scaring the hell out of you, then the screen goes static and your character screams.  THAT is the end of the game. [/spoiler] 

I'm sure the developer will be adding things eventually, so keep your eyes on this one in the future...the [b] far [/b] future. Right now, though, I wouldn't even wait until it goes on sale.  This is literally a 20 minute demo of what [i] could [/i] be a decent game, but you have to pay for it. This game sucks, it's not scary at all, and the shadow that's supposed to scare you is always the same. I've lost my time and my money. [h1] Boring [/h1]

It`s always the same boring game. You walk down the staircase for five minuts pass out, do it again. You don`t make any progress and it gets boring really fast...",-0.1267115251897861

Good soundtrack I rate it 10/10! I can't really say how appropriate this music is to the game it accompanies...largely because I haven't played so much as five minutes of said game yet. But I CAN say, for such a moody-lookin' game, this sure-as-sh*t ain't a moody f*ckin' soundtrack.

   Look, it's fine. It's sufficiently melodic, very well produced, and offers a whole lotta tracks for not a lotta cash. I guess that, er, ""chilled urban grooves"" (taking a punt here) just ain't my cup of tea. I bought this soundtrack in the hopes that it would at least be at the cuter end of spooky, but it's nothing of the sort.

[b]Fraulein Lolita~First Date With You~[/b] is a lewd card game about winning (and ultimately BANGIN') a nice lolita.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Play a hand of cards to create combos and advance a relationship meter to unlock a series of lewd cutscenes. Each card can only be played during certain events, and the results of each play are determined by a roll of one or more dice. Should you fail your roles, you will be penalized. The idea is to play your cards in such a way that you maximize the number of dice you get to roll, also making careful use of ""poker chips"" which allow you to play cards twice in a row. 

[h1]Story[/h1]
[i]To my understanding,[/i] the game revolves around an unnamed protagonist and a woman he met at a festival, Luo Li. She has survived a tumultuous childhood, and he hopes to find his way to her heart (and lady lips). Apparently, her idea of dating involves some sort of bizarre card game. But hey, I ain't complaining!

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
The titlescreen is promising, though I couldn't read any of it (seeing how I don't read Chinese). From the options menu you can adjust audio preferences, or toggle the introductory tutorial on/off. I enjoyed the user-interface, I thought it look polished. However, the in-game visuals were a mixed bag. I wasn't fond of clashing textures; there are a combination of anime-styled images and textures and real-life photographs. The models didn't always look like they belong together, the clipping was out of hand, and the main character's face was a different color from the rest of her body.

Kind of reminds me of the [b]Skyrim[/b] ""grey face bug""!

[b]- The Goods-[/b]
There are a few sex-scenes to see, which are unlocked as you fill-out the heart at the top of the screen. Each scene involves the female protagonist and a shadowy apparition (to represent the male protagonist). The female looks pretty alright, but the man is dreadful. Her genitalia does not take to his hot dog wiener very well, which causes it to become horribly disfigured. If I saw somebody with a coochie like Luo's, I'd be on the phone with the hospital! I thought the animations were serviceable, but there were some wonky hair physics.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
I can't say I recommend this game, though if you're a Chinese reader you'd certainly enjoy this game more. I found the gameplay to be tedious, and the application itself is super buggy. The protagonists and interactive objects spawn in strange areas, and there were multiple times that the female protagonist spawned in doubles. Mashing through the text boxes and animations wasn't very fun, and I would have liked to have been able to skip them; they got old fast. The randomized outcome of events meant that some of my playthroughs were wastes of time, because the game decided to give me one too many snake eyes.

 The changes are just enough to still get me 
 it's just ok I guess Great game with one hot Nun. Sexy demon nun really cool story and awesome atmosphere. i was able to launch a man into the stratosphere with a garbage can in the first part of the game. 10/10 Man, I was really conflicted with this one. I feel bad thumbing it down to, especially with how responsive the devs are in the discussion threads and reviews.

Props to you, and I respect your effort.

The below will sound very nit-picky but is meant for the devs since they seem they care

----

Summary of my Experience that led to the thumbs down:

I beat the Revival and got ending 1, if I hadn't got this ending, I probably would have been a happy camper, thumbed up the game and moved on. Instead I got extremely annoyed for 2 major reasons.
- At no point did it feel like I was entering the ""Final Area"", which checkpoint locks you, meaning i would have to go through 70% of the game again to get back to the non-linear part to get other endings. (I didn't look them up afterwards but I did look up the one I was going for which was ending 5, and the game kinda misdirected me, saying go into the cabin when the ritual starts, the only that started was stairs extended to a new area, which I thought would lead back out, hence annoyance)
- I'm really over this whole alternate ending thing some games have. Because if you get the subpar ending, your whole experience feels immediately cheapened and wasted. Ending 1 is that ending. It's abrupt, left field, short, zero satisfaction. I like Endings that play into the actions you make, but are all fairly similar, not based around oh I got checkpoint locked, because I went through one wrong loading screen at the wrong time, or I didn't find 3 random items hidden in some corner far from the player starting point at some random instance out of a few instances. The only time I want this, is when I mega love a game, which has happened like 3 times. Easter Eggs, hidden secrets are fine, but when it covers up the juicy good bits of a story, it's in the wrong direction.

So with my satisfaction left empty and bitter, I turned to trying to look up the endings but couldnt find a straight to the point video with the Revival update. I found one of the old version of the game, and skipped through it to see what the experience was like and how it differed.
I read a review talking about how they preferred the previous version, which surprised the developer, they claimed the pacing and structure didn't change much. I was more inclined to believe the dev. Until I watched this youtube video which showed all the endings and a rough gameplay/story break down.


[h1] The 2 versions are dramatically different experiential and story wise.[/h1]


This led me to indecision, do I waste time replaying the game when I really dont want to, to get a different ending. Or do I play the old version.

I decided to play the old Version.

To Summarize: The old version did need a big update. It suffered from a lack of audio, pretty much across the board, and some weird pacing decisions which I'm assuming is based around Student project and Time. I got about 70% of the way through the old version before I stopped, I felt like I saw enough to give my review at this point.

----

I will breakdown here a comparison of the 2 versions of what is better and worse in both versions


Revival: ====
Pros: 
- Visual updates & visuals overall are really good
- Dialogue system improvements are across the board better
- Gameplay improvements
- Levels and some areas you can explore more of
- Cutting to the next chapter is less abrupt (This was really bad in the Original)
- Soundtrack is incredible in setting the tone
- Talking about the black roses and the people in the woods going missing mentioned by Neil, was really cool

Cons:
- Story is not subtle, it literally ruins the plot in like 5 secs of the game if you talk to every NPC, if you have watched a lot of horror, it's not hard to surmise who/what lilth is. To the point this isn't a spoiler.
- AI doesn't get better
- The game is too short to have such a dramatical shift in visuals and tone. It goes from feeling like you are in a 1960s version of the Nun Movie, to Silent Hill meets Hellraiser. This contrast doesn't feel good at all, and feels weird. The Original's hell looks much more natural for what you would expect in the game.
- Lilth is not scary. Not in the slightest. It's not subjective. The Nun is more of an interesting movie with horror elements, not a scary movie. But in the original where it feels like a demonic entity and Lilth are working together to haunt this town and the player, actually feels very eerie, and since the story in the original isn't direct you are asking questions like what is going on, who is that, what the hell is that.... In this one when you see lilth since they show you her in the first 5 secs and then you learn her name in the first 5 mins you are like Oh lilth. Oh Hi Lilth.
- Charon is a furry now

Neutrals:
- Level Design: The level design in hell, gets better, but it also is 3 times bigger, confusing because the visual change is so stark different. I didn't realize i was in a mirror world till I explored a lot more.

Original: ====

Pros:
- Actually has some horror and eeriness to it. Actual Horror. 
- Intro: The horror it starts at the beginning in your dream. You are being followed by a cloaked figure that disappears, but gets closer as you get closer to the exit. (The knocking in the Revival was a great touch but everything else wasn't as good) Then you wake up at NIGHT, not in the morning on a bright sunny day, you then have to go back to sleep and this sense of Will I go back to that nightmare?
- When you escape the park, you are surrounded by ghostly figures that have a really cool visual effect if you get close to them. This was really cool and more effective player of putting the player in a eerie situation and guiding them where you want but still allowing for a little exploration. (This was too short but this was an overall issue of the original.)
- This one is big. The NPC Dialogue and placement is much more logically placed to guide the player to places of intrigue. And to ask questions about what is going on. The old lady mentions something went wrong in the past, and is facing towards a cabin. Neil is being questioned and warned, then disappears the next day and no one claims to know a neil.
- Postman Job. The game stuck better to doing your job instead of a random delivery job in the second day of revival.
- Finding the homeless guy dead on the slab, this is just empty in Revival, but having that connection because i found the homeless guy and a bit of his story and then seeing that conclusion was great.

Cons:
- Chapters are very abrupt and short
- The game is just much shorter inbetween each segment and overall, there isn't enough time to let things sink in
- Soundtrack  is just missing and is painstakingly felt
- sfx are just not as good in most cases, but in some are still good and subtle. I think I actually prefer a lot of the SFX in the horror scenarios, like in the park, there were a lot less random sounds that were just confusing me, and actually drawing me to the horror spots. But in other cases there were some spots just missing sounds or not properly tuned or as strong
- Lighting wasn't as good
- Some people you couldn't talk to
- Gameplay and animation issues
- Checkpoints were even further apart causing you to start over really far back

----

My unsolicited Recommendations of how this should have been handled. Would have been to take some of the changes of Revival (Soundtrack, sfx improvements, some visual improvements (Better Animations, Lighting, meshes and textures, extend the levels to let the player explore more and not have as abrupt ends to each chapter). Release this as a patch, aka Remaster.

But the changes to the story, lilth, and the silent hill aspects, is such a different game, that it should have been a spin off/spiritual successor, this would have allowed for basically new sales/marketing/first day release.

(Hit Char limit, I really do hope this helps, Best Regards) I really love the setting, atmosphere, and story of Helltown. The town itself is beautiful and the retro graphics give the game a really unique look. I have played both the original and the revival, and both have pros and cons. For instance, in the original version, the danger seems to be a little less immediate and story details are more ambiguous. In the revival, one of the first people I talked to on day 1 mentioned Lillith, which makes it more evident that there is a cult/something weird happening in Little Vale. I liked the improvements in the revival and how certain sections and enemies were made easier to deal with (ex.: the part where you find the keys in the graveyard). There were some changes that left me a little confused. Where did the homeless man's dog go on the 2nd day? Also, the original version's dog ending was one of my favorite video game endings ever, so I was sad that it was not in the revival. I'm not sure which version of Helltown I like more, but I definitely had a good time playing and recommend both versions. I can see there is something special about this game, and would love to see more stuff like it. I actually think that Helltown would make a very good horror movie too! Never got to play the original due to it not working on my PC, but seeing as the remake was given to everyone who owned the original I gave this a shot last night.  I can confidently say that this was pretty fun, I did wind up using a guide to get a few of the other endings, and it took me around 4hrs to actually get all of them. The presentation is really really nice looking and the actual story is really fun even if you see everything coming a mile away.  

It was definitely worth a good evening sharing some spooky content with my community, I'm not sure how it holds up to the original but I do think this remake here was a lot of fun.",0.08432428253856826
397390,Space Food Truck,game,False,"25 Mar, 2016","Indie, Strategy","Space Food Truck is a cooperative, culinary scifi adventure. 1-4 players take on unique roles aboard the Galaxy Gourmet. Their mission: explore a vast, procedurally-generated galaxy in search of exotic ingredients, craft delicious recipes, and withstand the untold dangers of deep space.","Games is fine. The game is a buggy mess that creates more frustration then it does enjoyment. Its built like rogue-like, so the bugs are compounded by game design that basically comes down to rng. Some strategy can be used but for the most part a run can fall apart fast, and then it dies a slow, boring death. Great deck builder!! Its a cute game, but gets really complicated really fast with the crew crisis things and the fact that every turn, you draw a ship event card and its almost always bad, just like the demo video says. Weird that they would hit you negatively almost 75% of the time. I have played 3 rounds so far and not made it more than the first recipe. Overall would not recommend, its a bit over complicated in places where it makes the game feel like the devs dont want you to win at all Quirky deckbuilder, will continue playing later and upgrade the review.

It kind of feels like Pandemic + Deckbuilding + FTL. 

I recommend :+1: An innovative deckbuilder, with an innovation that has put a number of people off: you're forced to buy a card every turn.  (Also, the four decks in parallel thing is potentially a bit rough, although it was manageable for me.)  This means that managing bloat is very important  But with that in mind, I was able to win my second game (the first was spent learning things I might have learned from watching the video tutorial), and it was a perfectly enjoyable 3 hours.  I'm not sure that I want to go back to it (but I'm not sure I won't), but it's genuinely innovative and was worth the low price. I have played one single game of Space Food Truck.
In order to complete game, which we lost (but that's irrelevant), every single player had to disconnect and reconnect over 6 times each, more for some because the game de-synched WITHOUT WARNING.  If not for us being on Discord and updating each other EVERY SINGLE PLAYER TURN we never would have known that quests were either complete or incomplete.

Additionally, we would get stuck on black screens, waiting for player turns to end (that had already completed their turn minutes ago), watching phantom turns (things that didn't actually happen) etc.

This game is dog water.  Do NOT spend your money on it.  The concept is fine, and if they simply programmed a game that didn't suck, it would be great, just like Slay the Spire or Across the Obelisk.  But they didn't.  It's a buggy, unreliable mess. A cautious thumbs-down for now. 
Despite being a decent-looking deck-builder with graphics and mechanics more similar to Monster Train than Slay the Spire, the obscure UI makes it quite difficult. There are tons of elements that are not explained and a tutorial gameplay scenario is lacking. I haven't been able to get far on the easiest of difficulties. The sole developer has not been seen or heard of for years, so the remaining bugs are almost certainly not going to be fixed. 
But if you can fiddle through the obscurities and suboptimalities and are willing to give it a try, it does look promising. If you like deck building games, this is well thought through, the design, graphics and music are very nice! Considering this was made by 2 people (is that correct?), this is a pretty polished result.
I just wish there were stuffs to unlock when beating the game. That would make the replayability rely on more than choosing a harder difficulty tier.

 This game is very quirky and memorable. The roles and co-op nature of the game are very dynamic. As rogue-like co-op card games go, this one is decent enough on it's own. However, this game suffers greatly from both the RNG elements of a deck builder, and the events system. There's a solved amount of strategy, especially with the forced purchase mechanic.

The forced purchase mechanic is the worst thing I've ever had to deal with. You're being taxed for not staying on top of the cruelties of the universe. There's a bit of bias here, I'm mainly just frustrated on how much this game attacked me with little agency to stop it.

Lastly, unless you're playing solo, the multiplayer is extremely buggy with the UI and connection. You'll find yourself full restarting with your whole co-op crew quite often. It's a seven year old game with major issues like this.",0.015990971312072236

2614580,Inspector Waffles Early Days,game,False,"15 Nov, 2024",Adventure,"A top-down detective adventure with point-and-click mechanics, inspired by classic Game Boy games. Follow Waffles in his first days as an inspector who wants to prove to everyone that he is more than just a rookie. But beware‚Ä¶ Your future worst enemy is hiding in the shadows.","Very cozy and nostalgic, rather short game, loved the soundtrack ^^ Good old days when Inspector Waffles was a strict anti-milk-drinker and played by the rules ^^ Very short but charming point-and-click adventure game with a lovely retro-Game Boy aesthetic. The game is prequel to the prior Inspector Waffles game, but it completely stands on its own and if you haven't played it, there will be zero issues just playing this. 

But back to the point, love the charming characters and writing in this game, and the length is perfect, not too long or short. Easy recommend to any point-and-click adventure fans or fans of games like the Ace Attorney/Phoenix Wright series, even more casual ones since there's definitely nothing too demanding, zero-way to soft-lock yourself, and what you need to progress an investigation is never more than a minute or two away at absolute most. Cute! A bit different than the first game, they went with a game boy aesthetics for better or worse, instead of a more traditional point and click. While it does give the game a unique style, and feel, it also makes the gameplay a bit jank, due to the limitations the game impose on itself while adhering to a specific style, that limits what can be done.

Main problem is the text that is quite annoying to read since so few characters fit on the screen. The controls are also stiff, you movie in a grid and there are invisible walls everywhere even if it looks like you can walk past something and it's pretty hard to see what some things are (something the game makes some tongue-in-cheek jokes about). Nothing major, and it was a intentional design choice so you can't fault the game for it, other than point them out you can make of it what you want. If you think you will hate the gameplay due to how it looks, you probably will, and on the other hand, if you love this style, you will love the game. It has the same charm and silly cat/dog jokes as the first game,

The actual cases are fairly easy, but the side quest where there is one part of the big puzzle in each map has some head scratching parts. As long as you don't report in to your partner, you can still find it even after solving the case, so you can't really lock yourself out, and it's pretty obvious what are part of that puzzle and what is part of your main case.

I liked the game overall, but I can't say I loved the choice for going for a game boy color style, might very well be that I don't have nostalgia for the format, so that's partially on me. Great prequel to the first game, love the game boy vibes. Prequel to Inspector Waffles as the title says, but in 8-bit gameboy style. The cases are simple to solve since there is no penalty for choosing the wrong clue during questionings. All the difficluty comes from solving the optional Mad Catter plotline puzzles that happen during each case. Missing one stage means You have to restart a finished case.

While I had fun I hope potential future games return to traditional point and click. Similar to the first Inspector Waffles game, the second game was fun to play. It is actually a prequel in which we follow Waffles during his early days as a police inspector, when he confronted his arch nemesis Snowflake with his partner Pancakes. The story is spread over several standalone cases which progressively converge to the main storyline. For each case, the player needs to collect clues and interrogate suspects to deduce the solution. The investigation mechanics are simple and cannot get too difficult, due to the limited number of choices, but trying to piece the solution without clicking at random is engaging and at times surprisingly thoughtful.

Before playing, I had two main reservations. First, I was divided about the Game Boy aesthetics, especially the sound effects, which sounded pretty garish to my ears. Pretty quickly though I got used to both, even if I still preferred the aesthetics of the first game. Second, I was curious if the story would keep my attention, as we knew where things would turn out from the first game. Indeed, I would have appreciated some further twists or side material but the story was well crafted and I can't really complain. 

Ultimately, the only standout flaw of the game is that it is unsure at times if it wants to be funnier or more serious / darker. I think this was also an issue with the first game. For example, [spoiler] the first cases about the video games and the magnets are humorous but the tone changes quickly in the next case, which features drugs and a murder. The game tries to present Snowflakes as a Hannibal Lecter character, but I had to squint a lot to see him as this kind of threat. Finally, the characterisation of Waffles and Pancakes becomes more serious later on but I felt it could have been utilised more.[/spoiler] Still, these are minor issues. I would enjoy following Waffles in subsequent adventures! Inspector Waffles: Early Days the highly anticipated (at list by me) prequel to Inspector Waffles delivers great cases to investigate. In this gameboy color game you collect evidence and use logical reasoning to figure out details of the crime who? how? why? etc. The beloved quirky puns of first game return with many pop-cultural references to 80s and 90s movies with great 90's vibes ( based on tech and cars ). The game is not only satisfying prequel, but works as a solid stand alone story. I loved the waffles characterisation as newbie investigator and a gamer, as well as his relationships, backstory and milk plot element make him relatable protagonist. I didn't manage to solve what I assume was an easter egg puzzle in case 4, so will definitively replay it at some point. I highly recommend it for fans of fuzzy detectives and pun enjoyers, as well as anyone that likes to investigates and vibe to chill retro aesthetics. Also giving my best to the developer Yann, I have played every game you have realised including those on itch,io, and I'm looking with anticipation to whatever your next endever is going to be as I have enjoyed all of them, so whether its going to be related to inspector waffles, or a a complitly new story looking forward to it. I'm really enjoying my time with Inspector Waffles. The game is very charming and chilled out. It has a great pace and the difficulty is perfect for a relaxed gaming session. I think the mix of adventure game play and the overhead perspective works really well, too. Makes you of the good old days when you just finished homework, put fresh batteries into your Game Boy Color and forget about all your problems for at least a little while.

Fix the center of gravity for the truck (seems too light when turning and driving, maybe add some weight)

Add a mini map with plots where the trash bins are, maybe a route

For the future:
Hopefully add a bigger town for the front end loader with shopping plazas (strip mall etc)

Maybe a city with some traffic lights and traffic 

Add an option to configure a joystick for some realism to control the arms in the game

But, boy, it gets increasingly depressing and sad. This chapter gets the series back up with much better puzzle solving in a more open ended type of solving the puzzle which is what Kings Quest is about, some puzzles are really challenging, and the story kept me glued for the start of the final chapter to the last part.
I loved that they managed to do a lot and still confide themselves on the trope of King Graham being old. 10/10 creativity.
There are some meta-commentary from the developers saying they would fix the previous stories(chapters) now which I found funny actually, even though chapter 2 and 4 would need a complete rework.
This chapter hits hard if you liked any of it's characters in any of the previous chapters and, without spoiling anything, I was hoping that the narrator at the end would change and when it happened it was perfect.
I truly hope we have a continue with this series if they learn from the mistakes of chapter 2 and 4, and keep the emotional growth from the story moments in chapters 1, 3, 5.
Unfortunately chapter 1 is the best. Really  good retro games..been playing  this collection  since it first came out years ago. A very melancholy retreading of chapter one‚Äôs environments plus a few more memorable bits and an adequately satisfying finale. The gameplay and puzzles aren‚Äôt particularly strong this time and feel, well, a bit old. That leaves it up to the narrative and somber music to carry the experience, which they certainly do. Even though the chapter has a weak start, the feels hit hard later on. It‚Äôs always emotionally gripping to watch a well-traveled character deal with ‚Äòend-of-life‚Äô exhaustion and desperation as they come to terms with what leaving behind a legacy means to them. There‚Äôs absolutely no reason to overlook the final chapter if you‚Äôve already made it this far into King‚Äôs Quest.

great conclusion and realy good adventure game A great conclusion to a great game.
Like the best chapters, Chapter 5 made me laugh, made me think and made me feel for the characters.

I've been invested in the chapters, but I dont think I was as emotional as the game wanted me to be. I will say overall its not perfect, but I've really really enjoyed this series. Haven't come across a game yet that has been so compelling in so many ways: art style, voice acting, puzzles, story and characters.

Really hope Odd Gentleman continue with the series. This was an acceptable ending for this well made game. I actually thought this was one of the stronger chapters emotionally. It has some fun nods to the previous games, and it seemed to be a more balanced chapter in terms of puzzles versus adventuring. If what I played at the end was the playable epilogue, those that were concerned about not getting to play it because they bought the game in parts, you're not really missing much. It really didn't need to be playable at all and really doesn't add much to what we already knew from the rest of the game. EDIT: So the epilogue was released a little later than my initial review.

 it's so much junk and not as good as the previous game, it isn't user friendly and the graphics are garbage PanzerGeneral Great game easy hot keys and visuals are solid, currently just doing campaign. Almost to many vehicles and units to pick from but I like it very much. If you like a good World War II tactical strategy game; this is for you! Just like Panzer General and sequels many years ago; it engrosses you in the background of your mission(s) and has some unique story twists that you may not see coming; but are very relevant to your current campaign.

PROS: See above; in addition I love the carry-through of your forces to the next campaign and the progression with veterancy; the addition of green recruits and based upon their survival also becoming veterans of your forces and campaigns. Medals and heroes are rewarding. See what I did there? lol

CONS: I had one bug; but think I borked a command at one point and the next mission wouldn't load. Had to come up with a work-around last year. I forgot what I did but believe I found the answer on the Steam Disccussions. So if you encounter that it may help.

OVERALL: 9/10 in implementation and playthrough. I would like to see additional mini-campaigns added in between the overall scope of the campaign and maybe a bit of overall strategic narrative (ie briefings with the Commanders of the Army(ies) that you are part of. ie a staff briefing like before a major operation starts with realistic maps and units represented. Be nice to see who I'm fighting alongside (off-map) and perhaps get an overall update(s) as you go along based upon how well my campaign is going and it's overall strategic impact on other armies / corps along the front line and / or army group.

No way should an elite Panther unit be kicked around by M3 Stuarts. Ain't happening.  Fun up to a point. I can see spending $20 om the base game but would stay away from all the redundant DLC's.

It's exactly the same as NAM, it's just that the setting is World War. Virtually nothing was done to make an improvemnt over that game. Once again, I recommend playing Duke Nukem 3D, Ion Fury and/or Shadow Warrior instead.

Eduke32: https://www.eduke32.com/ More difficult and polished than Nam/Napalm. For some reason it bugs out with wasd.
If you shift your wasd over to esdf, use right click for either jump or crouch. 
There is a terrific game here you have to pry it out and once its going the old school cannot be matched. This is a build engine game. (Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, Blood, etc.)...
WW2-GI is a pseudo-sequel/pseudo-remake of an earlier total conversion for Duke Nukem 3D called Platoon TC. this is a great game Do not buy this, there are plenty of Duke Nukem style shooters AND World War II shooters out there which are more fun, more accessible and more graphically pleasing - even in early 1990-s standards.
By ""accessible"" I mean a game that is actually playable by a person who is not a hardcore FPS player, who doesn't do anything in their free time apart from playing FPS.

Not that long, but the collectables and secrets will extend your playtime, if that's your jam. Otherwise, an interesting narrative keeps things lively. For the price, especially on sale, totally worth it. Jumpy jumpy This is one of those chinese plattformers, which looks quiet nice, has an ok level design, some interessting mechanics, but totally lacks any polish in regards of physics. One jump button, always the same the jump. No small jump, no slow or fast jump mechanics, no regrabs. No run or ducking mechanics. Nothing. This makes the game quiet easy as a plattformer, but also boring, as you click only one button the whole game. That's a very common issue in many chinese 2D-plattformer, and I hope the developers some day starts studing games like, Super Mario World or Celeste.

Some other technical issues. The german translation is utterly useless. It's just a very bad machine translation. Nothing makes sense, not even the first screen. Not that any dialogs are needed to play the game, but if you are kind of interessted in the story of the game: Learn english or chinese. Can't say anything about the other languages, but i wouldn't think, that they are any more usefull than the german. Such a shame. As the game doesn't get updates anymore, there is no hope, that it will be fixed in the future.

Aside from that, this game has one major technical issue. No V-Sync support or anything like it. If you don't lock your FPS in settings of your graphic card, this games takes every frame it gets and runs with like 800 FPS on modern hardware, which is kind of stupid and just waste of energy.

Can't really recommand this game, as it has so many flaws, but if you are lucky and catch this game in sell for a small bug, well enjoy the game. It's not that bad. so special game Really enjoyed this game! Decent difficulty, not as hard as say cuphead, Celeste, super meatboy etc. But a decent difficulty to keep you trying without loading your crap lol. Recommend especially when on sale nobody cares about your garbage story
otherwise good game Shio is a true platformer that is challenging, beautiful and simple. If you can get it on sale ($6.78AUD) you'll get an incredible game and experience if you're a fan of the genre but you wont be ripped off if you get it at full price.

It has an incredible art style, animations & level layout that offer challenge and serenity. ‰∏∫‰∫ÜÈöæËÄåÈöæÔºåËäÇÂ•èÂø´Ê≤°Á©∫ÁúãÂâßÊÉÖ Âæà‰πÖÊ≤°ÊúâÁé©Ëøá‰∏úÊñπÁîªÈ£éÁöÑÈóØÂÖ≥Ê∏∏Êàè‰∫ÜÔºåÊÉ≥Ëµ∑‰∫ÜÂ∞èÊó∂ÂÄôÁé©„ÄäÂΩ±Â≠ê‰º†ËØ¥„Äã„ÄÇ

the things i want to clarify about this game, as a 2d platformer game, the difficulty is balanced and not even hard at all, i don't know why most of the dislike review said its too hard, since this game is easier than most of the hard 2d platformer in steam

the game have 2 difficulty, easy and hard mode, i never tried easy mode, but already completed all the total time achievements in hard mode, so i think this game is friendly enough as a 2d platformer

overall the level design is ok, not so fun and not so bad 

the things i want to tell to people who want to buy this game:

this game can't rebind keys to most of the ""function keys"" (arrows and shift etc..)
this game can't control the heights of your jumps",0.021976034476034502

Control four new heroes as they uncover the mysteries of the Julesvale Caverns in Story Mode or test your mettle in the grueling Challenge Dungeons.","I love having every fight last 20 turns if I don't want to just go soaking up hits here and there because the dice pool decides to be really wholesome over and over again and make the game a stalemate.
It had potential, I want to like it, but I just don't. It's just not fun. The gameplay is pretty boring, the dungeons are pretty boring since there's so little enemy variety. It gets better later but it's mainly just ""early enemy but it has more health or regenerates stamina (which makes stalemates last even longer). 
I gave it a long break and came back to it and faced the same problems I did back when it first came out. The characters have fun personalities (except Hamir) but it doesn't make up for the fact that the gameplay loop makes me want to slam my head into my desk. Especially since there's pretty much no meta-progression, so what I do on one character doesn't really matter since I'm forced to play all of them and upgrades cost quite a hefty amount.
Maybe get the game if it's on sale and you're really desperate but I really don't think it's worth 20 CAD. i dont even like turn based strategy and this was peak

soundtrack carried This game was really fun to find out what can click at a moment's notice. Every fight can potentially feel different depending on what you got on you and I think that's really neat. My biggest complaint is that the game is so short. The story could also use more time with the characters and their development. But what was there was a really solid experience! I'd love for a sequel in any shape or form. I've yet to try the challenge mode but I absolutely love the gameplay so I'll probably be back to try it out. this is game is really really cool, its quite complicated to understand at first, at least for me it was, but once you get the hang of it its really fun, and the story so far is super interesting Love getting more characterization for our favorite Aetherians, and with a great combat system and art style! Game's really good. Music's great, the sprite work is incredible, the story is fine but its mechanics are fun. The fights are incredibly challenging due to the luck based behavior of dice. Most turns you'll be scrambling just to protect yourself, until you get a good roll for either a set up turn or actual hit. If you treat the combat in this game as more of a battle of attrition, it becomes a very particular kind of fun that I really enjoy that I haven't seen anywhere else. The game gets very easy once you get your builds going, and even the final boss fight ends in a few turns if you know what you're doing. Also, save scumming is really easy, so having fun is easy. Genuinely challenging, to downright frustrating at points...

However, despite that, 10/10 game. Great characters, great gameplay, great writing, great humor, great story, just GREAT EVERYTHING.

Even more fun when you play with a group of friends all doing voices!

Genuinely peak game, would recommend to anyone! this game feels like constant work
the campaign feels very slow, you have to do one character at a time and cant keep playing the one you want
the idea is cool in theory, but once you play a bit more it gets tedious
getting constantly fucked by rng and having to play so defensively most of the time until you can finally hit a random enemy, it just ain't fun for me If you're not in love with dice combat and being unable to actually walk from one room to another, this game will not be for you. You know, this game is pretty spiffy. Great art of critter people, neat game design idea, I like it. Really, the draft system stands out, never seen a thing like it. I think that in itself is worthy of parse. Bare in mind this is coming from the perspective of a person. Some say its too defensive, I found it to be a good balance when I focused on my resources. But by no means perfect, I'd love to see a second one with a bit more refinement for sure. This is coming from someone that has only played the campaign though.",0.15579973118279578
798460,Ni no Kuni Wrath of the White Witch‚Ñ¢ Remastered,game,False,"19 Sep, 2019","Action, Adventure, RPG","Journey back to the other world in Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch‚Ñ¢ Remastered. LEVEL-5‚Äôs classic tale returns better than ever, with improved graphics and performance.","Honestly, I was really enjoying the game. The mechanics, story, visual art, everything was very elegant and eye-catching. But as the story progressed, I realized that it was increasingly necessary for me to set up my tent in a field and start grinding excessively. As the game progressed, it became more and more evident. Tired of grinding, I changed the difficulty to easy so I could have a little novelty and advance, ok, it lasted well for maybe 10 hours, until I went back to grinding again. Honestly, if it weren't for already being on the last mission, I would have abandoned this game, absurd repetitiveness and all the mechanics that had excited me in the beginning started to seem tiresome to use 300 times in a row to get +1 lvl. i remember watching stampy play this game bro. <3 10 stars why cant you block with more than one person at a time in a boss fight .why is there a delay on spells.why is the AI dumb as fuck.sets too go all in .ai stands in fire and dies.what the hell is the share hp mp crap huh.... - The opening to this game is almost text book in inability to deliver an engaging experience and frankly, flat out incompetence. Five five feet. Cut-scene. Walk five feet. Cut-scene. It never ends. 2 hours into the game, It is still forcing me to walk five feet. . . cut-scene. 

The story within those cut scenes is extremely boiler plate. It would be serviceable if was in service to game play, but it's the focus in a languid and beleaguered way. Just in terms of competent writing, you need to cut down what's here significantly or write better. Yes, they did get Studio Ghibli to make cut scenes and those are charming, but even those are clearly from the same story board. If this was repacked in some way and you told someone this was a Ghibli movie, they would call you a liar. Everything is obviouis, slow, and boring. 

But what about that game play when it does happen? The combat system is very older RPG which a little bit of freedom of movement and extra systems tacked on. It feels like unnecessary clutter-- busy work in the fight to make it feel more complicated or keep the player busy. I would have preferred pure turn based just to shave down the nonsense I need to keep track of. Even systems like being able to move and dodge attacks while you select your own isn't meaningful, because the game is not that hard. 

Are there positives? Sure. The game features a pokemon-like system of obtaining and training new critters. These are fun and are functionally the same as new playable character in combat, they aren't implemented in any meaningful way, in fact, I'd say it's pretty clunky with a stamina system that forces you to continually change them out with each other and the human characters. 

There's a tiny amount of exploration. Tasks to do. The larger exploration and goals are not what I'd call robust. 

The graphics can look nice at time. I was impressed by the towns especially. There was some weirdness to the cutscenes. The game functionally has 3 art styles. The main game, the 3d cut scenes, and the ghibli animations. The 3d cutscenes stand out as wonky and unusually poorly done. There would be weird lighting changes that clash with where you just were in the 3D game world. 

So that's a lot, but I really don't have a lot of positives to say. It's what looks like a ridiculously high budget game with zero aspirations, attention to detail, or inspiration. 

4/10 at best. This charming, timeless action-RPG exudes the Studio Ghibli vibe and incorporates a coming-of-age story in an isekai setting. The mix of turn-based & real-time combat with creature collection also adds to its unique flavor. Two thumbs up üëçüëç :) This game's difficulty is very balance if you don't grind too much. The aspect of raising familiars is pure fun. My characters' level at the final boss are 45 45 and early 50ish on that last character. Definitely recommended for everyone even if you're not an rpg fan. I'm gonna be honest: The concept of a Studio Ghibli RPG does not make up for the fact the not-action-but-also-not-turn-based combat is more of a pain than it is fun. The world also didn't really grab me.",0.0737518759018759
839430,Flurius,game,False,"24 Apr, 2018","Action, Adventure, Indie",This is what happens when you do not brush your teeth.,"Meh, just kinda boring bad bad bad I'll be the first person to tell you there's just not enough Brazilian dentistry themed games on Steam, but Flurius is not what Tim ""Tencent"" Sweeney had in mind when he made the Unreal Engine.  This is a garbage low poly 3D rendered 2D retro shooter with a tooth-and-gum theme and a little mouthwash powered jetpack.  Mouthwash powered jetpack.  Yeah, me neither.

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

The game features lazy low-polygon ""retro"" assets, making this look like a barely functional 3D game from the 1990s.  It's unclear why the developers weren't able to arrange high quality, high polygon count contemporary assets for the game, and also irrelevant... what matters is that this looks bad as a result of their decisions, a compromise PC gamers shouldn't have to put up with.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 2 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

Flurius is relatively cheap at $1 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.

Before I get into the actual review, let's review the positive and negative changes:

+ Incredibly well-written story, even more so than the previous two
+ Extremely fleshed-out characters
+ Lots of fun references to other media and games (NieR: Automata and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure being two)
+ Realistic MC that isn't just using the princess for seggs
+ Poochi Q's personality is really complex, with foreshadowing
+ absolutely BANGER OST. For Kaiju Princess 1, it was Shining Star by Koichi Morita but now it's an actual commissioned song like for The Arrogant Kaiju Princess.
+ Much more streamlined UI
+ Much better exploration system. 
+ Fun af to guess food recipes when they aren't found, and Poochi's reactions are priceless too
+ Throwback to KP1 where Xao would do the nasty with the MC
+ Throwback to KP1's ending, which honestly made me the happiest I've been for a while
+ Roughly 10 hours of gameplay (not including plenty of seggs) for 15.30. Even at full price it's worth it
+ Exceptionally cute outfits that strike a balance between lewd and modest (compared to the previous two)
+ Throwback to the Magical Girl outfit from Kaiju Princess 1
+ More interaction options
+ cute cooking simulator
+ Addition of anal and oral during H-mode
+ Better orgasm effects during H-CG

- Removed L & R hand individual control
- Removed ""cum inside/outside"" option during H-CG

Now, on to the actual review. Going over each aspect:

The most important factor: the story.
In contrast to KP1's meagre plotline and TAKPATDS' all-over-the-place isekai style, this storyline hits the mark. Why? Because of the reasons above: Poochi being an incredibly well-written and complex character that is clearly dealing with seperation anxiety, as well as coming to terms with her own immortality; the MC not straight up abusing her sexually or using her solely for sex like the previous ones, instead slowly warming up to her which is FAR more realistic, and teasing her plenty while she has the most adorable reactions; the side characters being of an interesting variety and always returning (Type V being based off Elva from Project QT, Yagi being a ex-turned-friend, Georgie being a gyaru and Nyan being a crazy-ass catgirl). 

I'd like to say that the characters are all unique, and the fact that they returned to help the MC meet Poochi to comfort her was also really nice. ""There are no enemies, only new friends"" about describes it.

tl;dr, well-written story, characters and a hentai MC that isn't a cunt? Sign me up!
Overall: 10/10, 10/10. Anyone who disagrees can go suck one.

Next, let's talk about the lewds, since that's what many of you horny fucks would want. (I bought it for the story and I don't have any regrets, it's like reading a manga that keeps on giving). 

The H-CG: Splendid. Different sorts of poses and clothes with Poochi with her as the star of the show, in different places and even a threesome with Type-V. The nightly seggs from KP1 (Xao sneaking in to pleasure herself with the MC's pp) was brought back as a bonus to the costume and other character CGs, and fits with the gluttony aspect (she be drinking the forbidden milkshake now). Overall, I'll give this a 10/10. 
The H-mode (Sex function): Even with the removal of L/R hands, the seggsmode is still GREAT. Three positions (same as TAKPATDS), same toys, nicer UI. In addition, more items to assist in grinding achievements, and clothing is saved for Poochi's dialogue box sprite as long as it isn't a Carnival or lore-important cutscene. Overall still 10/10, I want to give her all the praise she deserves and hug her pain away.
The non-Poochi H-CG: absolute fire. Go watch them for yourself, it's great. 10/10.

tl;dr horny people will like this game. 10/10 overall

Actions (e.g. shop, exploration, cooking):
So much more improved. The feeding mechanic was brought back to make it incredibly integral to gameplay, as well as even more streamlined, pretty and interesting with a wide variety of stat-boosting dishes that all looked really freaking delicious. (Mr. Chef, teach me your ways!) Exploration was also so much more fun with a turn-based RPG that allows people like me who love overkill to absolutely demolish bosses. The shop also appears on the planet for discounted items, which helps when you don't have enough money for full-price items. 

Even as grindy as the gameplay is, you don't feel worn out AT ALL. In fact you'll wish that it'd never end! And there's no relationship rank requirement every Carnival which makes it less stressful. A 10/10 and marked improvement from the previous games.

Ending: Just play it then watch the ending. It's seriously beautiful. 
Also, Poochi Q is my fav princess. she's just like me, for reals. 10/10

Overall: 10/10. Play the previous two, they're worth it too. Support these amazing devs.
Let's see what they come up with next, I can't wait :3 i like the game but theres a critical issue that wont let you save or load my game Cons:

* No English language for the spoken dialogue. 
* I miss the ponytail hairstyle from the Arrogant Kaiju Princess (I will refer to that game as Kaiju Princess 1.5 or KP 1.5 from here forward to shorten it) as it is not present in this game and was definitely the most attractive on Daigneux IMO.
* Daigneux from KP 1.5 is just sexier, so I do still prefer her by far over Poochi Q even though Poochi Q is still pretty darn attractive. 
* The outfits for Poochi Q are nowhere near as sexy & enjoyable as in KP1.5 for Daigneux - man, Daigneux had several outfits that were off the charts.
* No nipple or belly piercings / sexy tattoos - hopefully the next one will have such options. 

Pros:

* Upgraded visual support from previous games (now has 120fps support). 
* Has difficulty settings this time around to make things easier for folks who struggle with the time management / battle portions of the game. (honestly even on the normal difficulty setting, this game was over-the-top simple, so even if you struggled on a previous game, try this one on normal, I never lost a single battle at all on the first try). KP 1.5 was actually difficult in some areas where you had to really focus on managing your army, etc. but KP2 is SIGNIFICANTLY easier. 
* This is the 3rd game in the series and the developer has done a nice job improving the interface - it's very smooth and easier to navigate. All the games are similar with little tweaks and changes to keep things interesting. 
* Have to compliment the design of the character Yagi as well - she was just as sexy as Poochi Q if not more-so. 
* Developer did a better job of incorporating intimacy scenes into the narrative in this game with regard to the side girls - in KP 1.5 the side girl scenes felt more forced than anything else without a whole lot of believable context. This game does that a LOT better. 
* Better animation quality in the intimate scenes than previous games in the franchise. 
* Even better scenes in general than KP 1.5 in terms of just the scene designs / creativity. 
* No woke nonsense. 
* No additional DRM.
* No Epic Online Services. 
* No censorship that I am aware of. 

Gameplay Style: Point and click exploration, time management, managing attributes during explorations (food energy). The game is mostly on rails, so you won't have to make a lot of choices, just mostly manage Poochi Q's food energy while trying to boost the relationship, etc. 

Game Length: ~13-15 Hours. 

Final Rating: 7.5/10. It's a good, solid game and it's better than the original Kaiju Princess, but not by a lot. I personally thought The Arrogant Kaiju Princess & The Detective Servant was significantly better. Not only was Daigneux more attractive by far in that game than Poochi Q is in this game, but the story was better. If the developer reads the feedback at all, I personally would hope for a sequel to Arrogant Kaiju Princess for the next game. This one was still good, and I'd recommend picking it up if you like the series, but it just wasn't as good as Arrogant Kaiju Princess. DAWG
WHY IS THIS SO PEAK FOR AN HENTAI GAME ?! Story is actually interesting , H scenes are well made and i'm all for Min-Maxing runs and exploration i swear there be more deadly sins type shit I do highly recommend the game, but would recommend setting the difficulty on easy as it would take you twice as long to finish otherwise and the combat gets old very quickly.

Game is fun for what it is, but I would recommend to get it when on a discount as the scenes (as good as they are) are a little too one note. I play all Kaiju Princess series on my main account, so what?

Claim retribution against the theocratic Faiths as you master vicious hack-and-slash combat in this action-RPG where style is salvation.,"unique and memorable game Plays like a dream -- smooth, intense, fast -- with nightmarish visual and musical style, and an amazingly touching story. I rarely see a game that fits together so beautifully; it's a perfectly cut gem. I cannot give it high enough praise. Best top-down, stylish action game I ever played--plus it's got the angriest (complimentary) art style to go with its hyper-violent take on the downfall of a cruel, overbearing institution that's so good to tear to bloody pieces I always forget to do a review for this game, but I have been shilling it since release, so I figured I would now.  I pretty much just want to say thank you to Melessthan3.

This game and Lucah were so good.  The customization of the combat in this game was so beautiful. Man, we need more games that play like this.

- Parrying and then doing a big bang when broken NEVER got old.  Not to mention swapping mid combo.
- The S Rank incentive (and that beautiful sound) the soulslike tension that comes from trying to make it through a dozen difficult encounters without taking damage, so you can survive when it matters most and keep corruption low for the whole game (legitimately redoing half the game after I knew how to get to the ends of the chapters so I could end them all with no more than 1 fight loss per chapter)
- The familiar mixing to make my break per second and single shot damage so satisfyingly high, and the  stance switching in mid combo that brought some Character action energy into the game if you really were trying to stunt.
- The characters were more fleshed out and strongly developed, and the presentation of the game really allowed your imagination to do things with the world you explored that I never would've expected.  I was always invested in what came next

There's so much.   M<3, I love your work.  This is an S-Tier game to me.   Thank you, and please keep making games like this. They removed the stamina bar from the first game. It's all I needed. An amazing follow-up to an amazing game.

The meatiness of the first game gives way to more of a bakers kind of feeling: appears simple at first, but as you learn the ingredients and ratios and techniques the experience changes completely.
At least 5 different playstyles (stun/dodge + slash/nuke & God Eater ranged pew pew), 
Huge amount of weapons and other customization options to tailor the above to a fine point.
Great number of both optional and mandatory boss fights.
Incredible normal enemy variety; in not just looks, but behaviour, vulnerability, and attacks too.

few complaints:

[spoiler]After defeating Michael [/spoiler] you get a hint as to where to go, but if you're taking your time w/ the game you're not going to know what they are pointing at.  Was personally lost for a few hours.

There is a huge power differential in dedicating Chris to one playstyle versus building him to be versatile, and changing between these builds is rather tedious, disincentiving experimenting with the different playstyles.

The customization is much too precise.
ex: there are 6 main weapons, each with 3 branches, leading to a total of ~24 weapons; there are also about as many 'prayer card' attachments to further fine tune those weapons.

Difficulty curve is a bit erratic and oftentimes normal enemy encounters can be harder than the actual bosses

Combat mechanics can stack too many multipliers on top of one another.
You can go a couple of runs finding an enemy or boss to be spongey if you play standard.
Then, if you play beautifully, stacking up multipliers and keeping a combo up, your foe just melts. Genuinely peak. Less than 100 reviews on here for a game of this quality? There is no justice Its good. More of lucah. very cool",0.11830493665356046

Something goes terribly wrong and the ship you are on containing the SCP explodes, and you wake up on a distant island surrounded by a vivid environment. Get ready to survive, fight for your life and finally escape the horrors of the island.","‚Äé I am 32 years old.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you. Hey guys! üòä I was really excited before I tried this game, I thought it would offer a different experience. However, some aspects of the game left me a little disappointed. ü§î

In the beginning, the atmosphere of the game was really immersive and managed to draw me in. The graphics and sound design were outstanding! üëå However, as the game progressed, some repetitive elements and limitations in enemy designs distracted me. üéÆüíî

Character development and storytelling seemed a bit incomplete to me. While I was hoping for a more in-depth connection, the emotional development of the characters was not sufficiently handled. This made the game experience a bit superficial. üòï

However, the puzzles and difficulty levels the game offered were quite enjoyable! üß©üîç Also, the overall concept of the game still continues to impress me.

All in all, ""Three Days"" was a game of mixed feelings for me. While it has some great aspects, its shortcomings cannot be ignored. Maybe in the future updates or additional content will enrich the game experience. üåüüëç

The premise isn't bad, but the lazy, low quality technical implementation is (remember, this is on Steam against games like Rust, Ark: Survival Evolved, Subnautica, Valheim... the list goes on). 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

A choice was made to use obsolete, decades old retro pixel ""art"" as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget or talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result.

There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics. 

The game only displays in 4:3 pillarboxed aspect ratio.  It's possible they developed this using an old CRT they found in a dumpster, or this game has been specifically designed for people gaming on PC's from 1995... either way, this isn't really acceptable in the modern era of PC gaming.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers.

Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the GameMaker Studio construction kit/toolset.  This is a very poor quality toolset favoured by amateur developers as it's cheap and requires little in the way of development skill, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities.  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.  GameMaker Studio is most commonly used to make retro pixel shovelware and cash grabs.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Three Days is relatively cheap at $3 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend. asd It is called Three Days, but all I got from it are three trading cards. wfsaddfa Three Days

10/10 Game has potential, but it's current state is much of an early access, because there is many bugs and exploits and things that needs to be reworked.

The main objective of the game is to build a boat withing 72 hours and GTFO from the island.

The tutorial in main menu instantly drops you in game after you read everything, without allowing you to choose what mode you wish to play. Also, in my opinion, tutorial would be more better if it was a mini-level where you do step-by-step crafting to learn the basics. 

The crafting system is complex and you don't know what to craft first - i recommend before jumping into game to have a look into craft sheet in the main menu and ignore warnings to see the basic stuff you need to survive the first night, i.e. at least learn how to craft campfire and spear. 

At day you're free to explore and find a perfect spot to build a base and get some food, and by base i mean a location with plenty of woods and rocks around and set up a campfire that will scare the night monsters away from it.
The speach bubbles of main characters hints what materials you must combine together to craft something but it is pretty random and sometimes annoying because the game HUD is pretty large and you cant see much things around you.
So, coming back to crafting, it would be much better if at least the bubbles would show images instead of text because reading takes longer time and time here running extremely fast and you dont have such time to think. Besides there is a bug happening where your character literally spams a lot of different texts in one speech sequence, and the bubble itself change colors like green when its day but its actually night.

Pressing Escape button during the game doesn't pause the game, it still keeps running even in background leaving you vulnerable even in easy mode. There is no saving features as well.

The combat is just crafting a spear or spikes, hold them with LMB and aim at your enemies while keeping them at distance. That's it. Often you might lose the spear on the ground due to the limited range of dragging the items but you can find it with a tether between the character and the item when you're close.

Some objects in game are really small and hard to see, like fish scale and glue. I think adding the background color behind them like shadow or icon might help to see them.

And few more bugs i've encountered during gameplay:
-I've managed to craft a boat and it had that windows saying ""press E to escape"", but spamming E led to nothing, big dissapointing bug. But i've managed to replay again pretty simple on easy and normal modes about 4 times, it worked;
-The daytime should be much longer and the skills that slows time should be removed, because in the night, the creatures that run away from lights are hanging on the edge of the light radius trying to get you if you're close enough, and because its so easy to kill them that way, you can get huge EXP drops and unlock all skills in 5 minutes, including those that slows time by ~50% and this thing leads to the very very very long first night. This is problematic for the shark spawn rates that drops material needed for escaping;
- Creatures killed in night respawns very often near the player and manage to successfully attack the player before retreating;
-Also if you wander from the campfire in night you might see that those creatures are not afraid of lights at all, they walk bravely around the base and they only becomes afraid if you're close to it and run away;
-Walls do nothing;
-fishing nets are almost useless, i mean it kills small fishes when they bumb into it (sometimes) but i was thinking it could collect fish over time and make stuff easier;

Hard mode is currently impossible because you start at starving and dehydrated state (and put in dying state in 10 seconds) with slow movement speed and you die like in ~20 seconds which is actually the time to walk to the closest tree/rock, break it down and craft a shovel // spear, it's pure RNG that the tree and the rock will spawn near campfire.

Another  thing is that you can die randomly by a thunder during rains, which is annoying when you almost done building stuff.

Overall, i like it. I think it can be better. So far it's interesting. The crafting system, while new and interesting, has a lot more issues then benefits. Like dragging a thing to another thing to make a new thing is nice but if you are even a little bit too close to something that that thing can combine with [strike]boom your day is borked[/strike]. 
I have been told that if you middle click on a crafted object it will be un-crafted. This can make the game's crafting better but with the time table being so fast seconds crafting and un-crafting could get you mauled by shadow chickens. (which was fun to type)

The graphics are something that could be over looked but with how little is on the screen as it is it would have been nice to have some better looking sprites.

This game is tagged as a ""Casual"" game however that is not true. This is a game with a far bit of difficulty. Although the difficultly is high it is the lack of enjoyment out of said difficultly that makes me not recommend this game.

Bottom line is this I can not recommend this game to most people as it will have very little reward for getting past the difficulty and the fact that it is tagged as casual when it is clearly not. Unless you are a lover of getting your rump kicked because of poor mechanics DO NOT buy this game.",-0.04675947853889036

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME --- THE EXPANSION PASS FOR THIS GAME - IT IS NOT ""...the ultimate WARNO experience....a deluxe bundle filled to the brim with extra content."" 

IT DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL CONTENT FOR THE GAME - THIS IS A LIE.

That is clearly misleading marketing designed to make the consumer think that all DLCs for the game will be included... HAD I KNOWN that it would not include ALL DLC, I would not have bought it.

 Do not spend $10 on this, its a nice-to-have if you buy the Gold Edition bundle.  This is the type of thing that most other ""serious"" wargames would include in the base product for free and not worth your money.  The information contained in here is nothing one couldn't find on Wikipedia or by watching Let's Players on youtube and most disappointingly has not been updated to include the additional Divisions, Scenarios, and Army General campaigns from NORTHAG or any of the Nemesis releases so far.  The information is certainly interesting, but do not buy this as a standalone product.

And worst of all, they missed the mark with the ""authentic US Army Field Manual"" feel by using a digital camo pattern on 1/3rd of the cover instead of M85 Woodland on the entire cover.  The result is these manauls look like they were published in ~2009-2013 instead of the late '80s. I would not pay for this, especially not for $10.

Thank you GOD BLESS. üò≥ very nice I, Billy Herrington, stand here today, humbled by the task before us, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our Nico Nico ancestors.

We are in the midst of a crisis. Nico Nico Douga is at war against a far-reaching storm of disturbance and deletion. Nico Nico's economy is badly weakened: a consequence of carelessness and irresponsibility on the part of acknowledgement, but also on the collective failure to make hard choices and to prepare for a new, MAD age.

Today, I say to you, that the challenges are real, and they are many. They will not be easily met, or in a short span of time, but know this, Nico Nico: they will be met. In reaffirming the greatness of our site, we understand that greatness is never given, our journey has never been one of shortcuts. It has not been for the faint-hearted, or who seek the fleshly pleasures. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the wasted genii, the creators of MAD things. For us, they toiled in sweatshops, endured the lash of the spanking. Time and again, these men struggled, and sacrificed, so that we might ... LIVE BETTER.

We remain the most powerful site on the Internet, our minds no less inventive, and services no less needed than they were last week, or yesterday, or the day before the day after tomorrow. Starting today, we must pull up our pants, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking Nico Nico Douga.

Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions, who suggest our server system cannot tolerate too many movies. Their memories are short, for they have forgotten what Nico Nico already has done, what free men can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose.

And so, to all the people who are watching this video, from the grandest cities, to the small villages where IKZO was born, know that Nico Nico is a friend to every man, who seeks the future of love and peace. Now we will begin to responsibly leave authorized common materials to Nico Nico people, and forge a hard-earned peace in this MAD world.

What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility. This is the price, and the promise, of Nico NiCommons citizenship. Nico Nico Douga, in the face of common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words: ASS, WE CAN.

Let it be said by our children's children, that when we were tested by DOS attacks, when we were refused by YouTube, that we did not turn back, nor did we falter, and we carried forth that great gift of freedom be delivered, and safely to future generations.

Thank you. God bless, and God bless Nico Nico Douga.",-0.03196779828358775

861670,Street Level: Windows Edition,game,False,"6 Jun, 2018",Strategy,A fast paced cyberpunk card game!,"thumbs up. is it a great game? idk . but is it a game that you can have fun with, absolutely Great game. I beat it in about 1 hour, but it was a solid experience. It is sort of like that old TI-83 game Drug War, but with a cyberpunk theme. The whole game is just choosing ""yes"" or ""no"" to jobs, or fights, or to buy upgrades, etc. There is actually depth here, though, even with just 2 choices and the game can get intense. For the price and about an hour of time, seems worth it. One note, there is no save games and there seems to be a bug where the game loses control if you alt-tab. So you have to beat it in one sitting. You hit yes or no and then text appears. I.... I said the whole thing about the game now.

FULL REVIEW: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moZ5UCoNtBg This game is an RNG adventure where your only options are to choose yes or no to the randomly provided action.  Actions provided include: upgrading stats, performing jobs, fights, healing, and chance encounters with local establishments.  

Probably one of the more difficult (see: frustrating) parts of the game is dying because you have no way to control when you can heal.  You have to wait until the heal prompt randomly pops up.  

The only other downside is that there's no way to turn the music off.  The music isn't terrible for the first couple of minutes, but I've got a playlist I'd rather listen to and no way of disabling the in-game music.

The game has potential to be a great little time-sink, but I think it's got some work ahead of it to truly BE great.  My recommendation comes with the caveat that the music be an optional thing. I beat it in 10 minutes - but could probably be entertaining for 30.  For 2 bucks, it's not buggy or overly complex, and will kill some time.  It's lack of depth and of the actions really meaning much (I just hit yes until my health was low, then paid for health, then hit yes on the jobs again) keep it from being a solid game, but for the pricepoint of 2 bucks, I'd recommend it for someone wanting to kill some time. Not a bad little game. I recommend it. It's a nice little time killer at a cheap price. The art work is simple, but It works for what the game is (And seeing as how I love neon and cyberpunk, I like it). It's a little tricky trying understand how some of the cards are going to behave, but I can see the appeal from a immersion aspect. It does feel like it's building a rudimentary world in a way.  There is a fair bit of reading on the cards, but once you get into the groove you begin to recognize them by appearance and can play it fast. I recommend it, and taking it for what it is, I give it a sold 7.5/10.",-0.01077586206896551
2175700,Odd Woods,game,False,"1 Nov, 2022","Action, Indie, Simulation, Early Access","Odd Woods is a survival crafting game in a forest environment. Build your base during the day to withstand the attacks of horror creatures at night. Explore, farm and hunt wildlife to survive another day.","Challenging and realistically fun I am really enjoying this game. The environment really is the star of this game. I do understand that it is still in early access, and right now it is still ""bare bones"". However it does not take from the experience of playing. The map is huge the monsters are creative and the crafting survival is fun. 
Check it out for the price it is a great Early Access play. nope ! not yet anyway. So far, I'm enjoying this game. The premise of the game is tried and true. A base-builder, nightly horde defense game with necessary exploration. The creature design, uncertain of if they are assets or not, are terrifying. The game is still in early access and I'm excited to see what the dev does with it. The game is genuinely scary once night rolls around and it's easy to lose track of time (which is a good thing) while out wandering and exploring. If I had to offer feedback, I would suggest providing more base-building parts, perhaps more folklore monsters/cryptids and create a larger map with more POIs. There is a means of travelling faster than on foot; I feel as though there needs to be more (interesting) reasons to travel further out. Creating a larger map with more POIs sounds like the remedy for me. Also, the eating/drinking mechanic seems kind of brutal. There is a short buffer window where, after, if you haven't consumed water or proteins/carbs after your thirst/hunger meters have depleted, you drop dead. This isn't necessarily game-breaking with it's current settings, but it does take some of the fun and immersion out of the game as the real threats should be more focused on the monsters and not satiation. You shouldn't drop-dead after not having drunken or eaten anything within a 24-hour time period. I'm not saying it needs to be completely realistic, but it's currently unenjoyably harsh. Again, this is just my opinion, but I feel far more nervous about food and water than I do about the monsters, which says something as the monsters and the nighttime are genuinely terrifying and fun.

The ambiance of the game is unique compared to other games in the survival building genre and that, to me, is what really makes the game standout the most.

I'm hoping the dev does something to balance the food and drinking system. The game is fun and, compared to most other survival crafting horror games, scary. The dev has something special here with some additional content and fine-tuning. I would recommend strongly if you're a fan of survival horror crafting games. While the game has a modest offering, the developer‚Äôs tireless efforts have transformed it significantly.  from its initial release  It's a Good game give it a try. Note the game is still in very early access,
please bare that in mind. This game may seem like a simple survival game, as its a bit limited on building, crafting and such, but to be honest its very well done. The mechanics of the game seem to be well done along with the graphics are smooth and during my game play on it had no issues with graphics on highest setting. It can be a bit of a grind, especially with the limited storage and low stack count, but with the option to place things to build in a blueprint form and just load resources on the go finishing base building, storage racks and more, it honestly wasn't to bad. I really enjoyed the challenge of the enemy waves at night, some of them a bit tough, while others being easy, all on normal difficulty. This game really does have a unique concept to a survival game and has been fun, and hope to see it further grow, adding more to the game, for added play ability. Highly recommend this to anyone who loves survival games for sure. Odd Woods

Graphics and sound are a bit pants. THis game is not well optimised and did not run well on my 2080 ti.
There are a few scares here, but there is no real game to speak of. You wonder aimlessly in a forest with a lamp until something gets you. I don't recommend this. THere are a lot better games out there. [h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]

The game took me about 50 minutes to complete. It does save your progress at certain checkpoints. However, you need to discover some items before the game saves. I think the game is probably closer to 30 minutes long but I was pretty dumb and didn't read carefully some notes I should have read that would have saved me a lot of headache. So please learn from my mistake and read everything!

The graphics and sounds are subpar. This game has an odd locomotion system. You basically look in the direction you want to go and then press left joystick to walk and press both left and right to walk faster. So you'll want to always be using both joysticks to move faster. Unfortunately, there is no smooth turning so you'll have to physically turn if you want to head the opposite direction. 

This game starts out by looking for clues in the cabin to find out what happened. Once you find the clues you'll be given general directions of where the next clue should be located. There are some jumpscares along the way. Meanwhile, you're supposed to avoid a monster walking around on the loose. If you have your light on, it attracts the monster. I found that I could see perfectly fine without the lantern so it wasn't as scary as it should have been.

This game does have some very gory scenes. Unfortunately, because of the bad graphics they look more like ketchup or tomato paste with deformed crash test dummies. Still, if you can forgive the visual fidelity, it's pretty gruesome. I did like the fog effect in the woods, that actually looked pretty cool. 

I liked the experience. I wasn't expecting much for the .99 cents sale price I paid on the VR Spring Sale on Steam. So it met my expectations. I definitely recommend this for any horror fan. This game has the right atmosphere and has a very slow and deliberate pace that just messes with your head.

Rate 6/10. Cool spoiler alert: [spoiler] You get to commit suicide by hanging if you want to quit the game! [/spoiler] This ""game"" is just an environment. There was one scare that was kind of cool, but other than that it's just a creepy cabin-in-the-woods setting at night.",-0.06469420460491888

The first is a pseudo-three-dimensional runner. The second is &quot;anti-G.T.A.&quot;, which deals with the &quot;trolley problem&quot;.","Not worth the money kinda weird but not exciting in the least. ""Boring in paradise"" is a godawfully badly made collection of two crap minigames slapped together terribly with the blight on gaming that is GameMaker Studio (from Yoyogames)... yes, the Comic Sans of the game construction kit world.  There's a 2D top down car driving game, where if you hit a pedestrian, and you're epileptic, the developer tries to kill you.  There's no forewarning about the strobing flashes that occur, so if you're sensitive to those kinds of things, absolutely avoid this game.  There's also a very lame ""dodging"" game where you move left or right to try avoid the word ""Pain"", which is representative of the experience of trying to play garbage shovelware made with GameMaker Studio.  I've reviewed well over 500 games made with GameMaker Studio, and they've all been awful.  This game is square in the middle of typical for GMS. 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

A choice was made to try to use obsolete, decades old retro pixel ""art"" as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics, at least it looks like that's what they were trying to do.  I don't know if there's a way to describe ""art"" that looks almost like it's pixel, but so badly made that it doesn't even make it that far.  It's clear that this is due to lack of budget or talent, and the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result.

There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics. 

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers.

Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the GameMaker Studio construction kit/toolset.  This is a very poor quality toolset favoured by amateur developers as it's cheap and requires little in the way of development skill, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities.  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.  GameMaker Studio is often used to make retro pixel shovelware and cash grabs.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this game is reflected in the general public reception.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the game all-time peak player count was only ONE player.  That's right, only one person ever played this at a time.  When I played this for the purposes of reviewing it, I equalled the peak player count for the game.  OUCH.  The only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from, the overwhelming lack of interest in the game is to be expected.  Gamers just didn't take this low quality game seriously, and for good reason.

Boring in paradise is relatively cheap at $1 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.

Although my own ineptitude is not a reason to downvote something, it just means it's not my genre and I should let that sink in.
But my own shortcomings aside this little puzzle game features adorable dragons as main cast, plenty of flavor, soothing music, no time limits, ability to undo all the moves done and lots of puzzles based on movement that only stops when encountering an obstacle with a few twists like managing colored gates. Sound very simple and the rules indeed are. The difficulty comes with the execution and to my surprise it is indeed very difficult to create a proper path with often the dragons themselves being the stopping blocks so another can reach its destination.
There are aids in the game in case of being stuck but their usage is limited with charges and to regain them one has to return to previous level where they were used and beat it without using help. I'm very confident that all levels are perfectly doable without helping tools (using them denies you score after all) but I've ran out of ideas and charges myself making me hard stuck. It is certainly something for true puzzle enthusiasts and my brain proven too smooth. If I ever happen to be escaping a puzzle dungeon
I'll be mining my way out with my head banging against some wall ^^'

I like that you can restart the levels as often as you need.  The levels get challenging very quickly.  I like that I don't have to take the time to go through a large number of easy levels before the real game begins.  Another great feature is the ability to undo several moves.  Not sure if this is unlimited, but is a great advantage to be able to go back some steps and not have to redo the whole level.

The donkey or the dog? It enhances and expands the amazing base game. So go for it. Consider that this expansion and even the main game cost less than silly cosmetics in other ARPGs! I did a very fun and thorough play through of the original game, and I am already digging into the game with the expansion. The devs have also been doing steady free improvements all year so you will be pleasantly surprised to return to it.

This game has a super relaxing atmosphere and a fun open world to explore that has some Witcher and Skyrim feel to it. I also really love hunting and alchemy. If you like games like Grim Dawn or PoE, you‚Äôll likely enjoy this game.

The main game with discount is cheaper than a fast food meal and the expansion is cheaper than a fancy coffee drink. This is a great value for gameplay.

Do yourself a favor and give the game a try!",0.13837952942119597

Metric Racer, a fast paced, cartoon shaded futuristic racer.","This game is great. The textures loaded. The ships moved. The pause menu opened. The resolutions can technically be changed. I'm amazed the game doesn't uninstall every single software on my computer and sets it on fire, very impressive. Abandoned Early Access game.
Do not buy if you are not okay with unfinished product. This game has come a long way, there's been a number of improvements, the handling is better, there's more tracks available now and the overall feel of the game has been polished with better controller support all around.
Worth checking out. If you want a high speed hover racer that doesnt suck, go play Redout. This game feels sloppy and awkward. You cant even drift or slide, the menus are buggy and break, controls are stiff, awkward and glitchy. It's effectively unplayable with a controller as well.

Theres no ability to strafe your craft, and the same button for right/left airbrakes, if you double tap them by accident, effectively 'teleports' your ship a short ways in that direction... often right into walls. The maps boosts are exactly the same as well, they dont give you a speed boost or anything, they just teleport you forward a bit. It makes the game feel awful and buggy. 

Seriously, just go play Redout, or wait for Redout 2. Impossible to control with a game pad. Bit messy but it's got potential. There's something off about this game, and I can't quite put my finger on it, but whatever it is gives me a headache. While this game is far from finished, I like the physics so far. It has a feel of Wipeout Fusion and a little bit of Pacer, while the tracks remind me of Redout. While the ship currently jitters a bit on corners, giving it a less solid feel, and there is currently no pitch control, I like the direction this is going in. Music is good, suits the game's aesthetics well. Like Redout, this game looks better in motion than it does in stills. I think it is worth the money and will be keeping a close eye on this one. [h1] has potential, but approach with caution[/h1]

it's in very very early access. but this show some promisse already. i'm surprised it didn't show on my radar sooner for an AG-racer fan like me. however, i must stress that the content of some tracks in the game is very, very incomplete. with some of them being unplayable (Terraformer is a good example on it). water surfaces are glitchy, and the ships needs more grip in my honest opnion... since, there seems to be no ""brake"" to speak of (you can decelerate if you let go of trottle tho, but the deceleration is very steep, so my strategy is to have a fine control on the trigger buttons, be tapping or gently pressing it on curves, to get the maximum my ship can give). lots of placeholders and stuff to be completed yet, but hey... it's a very early access game, so it is to be expected. 8 months on Early Access tho i think is a steep deadline in my opnion given the current situation of the world. if i were the developer i would give me more time... maybe an year or two given the pandemic, i mean, even without the pandemic i would give more time for the project to mature, if i was the head of it.

i'll give it a cautious recommendation for now. what i saw caught my atention but a lot of work needs to be done to solidify this project. so i'll show my support here. So far, this game has been highly unstable. Sometimes on some courses that I have raced on, I would constantly fly off the course for no reason. There would also be times where the main menu wouldn't load after a race. You could still go through it, but you would not be able to tell where you are in the menu since everything is black. I would suggest leaving this alone for at least a few years when its more successful. I just don't want to play a game that's just unstable and glitched.",0.017131782945736432

Help Sam get inner peace.","Cat is always cute. But his game is very boring. and poor controls -> not recommended. I made it to lvl 7 when it started to get tricky. I think a tutorial or at least hints would be a good thing, so you know when you get caught and when you can sneak by etc. It gets very frustrating that when you get caught you need to watch that scene to the end every time, would be nice if you could just press esc and restart or at least fast forward that part. Zoom out function to see the whole house would also be useful.
I find the game a bit to hard and time consuming when you need to watch the catch scene all the time, I can't really see kids enjoy the game with these difficulties but maybe I'm wrong. I do recommend it because it was still fun and a cheap game. The graphic isn't very appealing and feels a bit lackluster in my opinion.
I tried it because I like games where you have to sneak around and create a mess without being caught, but it didn't feel very engaging to play, and on harder stages of the game where you have trouble making it further, it just pairs with the frustration of the game being lackluster, so I didn't continue after the short time I played.

Others may forgive these parts of the game, but I couldn't, so I can't recommend the game, as there are more enjoyable games in this genre out there. ahahah, you wouldn't wish such a cat on anyone, but it's fun to be this cat.

I am not really good reviewing this one. But if you need VN that not in school. Here is your choices. Meet the loli baba, high school girl, ex- that have nee-san body, and old lady who never be loved, they are gather in this VN to be romanced

Overall the storytelling in this VN was soo good that make me absorbed in their story. I am just a bit disappointed this VN was short. Kikyou is my fav!

The soundtrack is pretty good! The characters are all lovable and the artworks is sooo good, the artist does improve a lot since this game came out though.

If you like spiritual stuff then this is good for you, I like youkai stuff, there is also ghost/spirit in this which I am quite spook out to be honest because I am not good with ghost stuff....

Overall the story is quite good since it got mystery and detective stuff in it. Got hook to the story till the end and it left me an impact.

trying to get all endings now.

What makes me buy this? Honestly the artworks itself makes me buy it when I first saw this.

EDIT : I got all the endings now, Surprisingly serious at times story from 1 of my favorite writers, artist, and 2 of my favorite VA‚Äôs. Really enjoyed this but my main gripe is I wish it had more unique routes without so much overlap between them.

8/10 A heart whelming VN.

Is worth it. Great VN. Sure, as usual the H-scenes sound like a chipmunk drowning in a bucket of Elmer's Glue but the story is very entertaining.
The (free) H-scene patch is probably  a must since the scenes are central to the story. I love this visual novel. But I again must comment on the dyeing of black hair to become blonde. Kurokami (black hair) must be bleached to become Kinpatsu (gold or blonde) hair. 

Sometimes the wording is awkward because the writer will use a word that isn't correct or one that conveys the wrong idea. 

Umu (yes, right, yep, uh-huh, good, etc.) is translated as harumph, which is jarring and does not feel right. Iyo is not Sheogorath.

The writer treats the reader like they are some idiot who cannot understand any Japanese whatsoever and writes whatever they think is ""cool.""

Unfortunately the R18+ patch isn't working for me so I missed out on the action. Pretty cool game from the creator of 9-nine- and Liminal Border. It might appear light-hearted at first glance, but it actually has pretty much everything possible, because Kazuki Fumi writes thrilling mystery, funny comedy, and touching drama. It's not perfect, and I'd wish for better side routes (go straight for Kotori during your first playthrough and think about the rest later) and better foreshadowing for the culprit, but overall it's still a strong emotional story Come for the plot, stay for the story. goodbyes and the bittersweet memories that linger, with a lot of h-scenes
if you get the patch, the cgs are high quality and maybe a little unruly at times, but with that in mind, there are some very enduring moments considering this genre of game

does run well on steamdeck tho It's sad to see, the game is mostly there, and then all parts just don't click into place. A real bummer. This game was fun at first but the further you get into it the more you observe the lazy game design. 

1. Mobs of investigators and soldiers just come through the same entrance over and over. 
2. World map is too needy. 
3. A lot of copy and paste side quests. 
4. Some units are pretty bugged and don't offer enough control over.

Unforunately they missed the mark on this one. Farily fun but not recommended. 6/10. I dont know why, but the game is not so fun, unlike EG1. The first EG got alot of things we could do and also there is a mod that can support the game.

PROS 
- pleasant art

- sfw mode 
- Dijon :D
- mini games
- multiple routes, very replayable 

CONS
- some of the characters had MUCH more content than others. 
- typos in the script
- felt rushed in some areas
- easy to softlock yourself
- hard to get every route without looking up a guide. 

Overal, pretty solid dating sim! Def an improvement from lovers trophy (still good, but this one is much more interactive) I'm looking forward to seeing Mr fish's future work :) Absolute fan. I just wish you could interact with Jak as much as you do with Dijon. Wish Amon was an option too One hundred and twenty one hours. 121 Hours. Is how many hours I have in Courtin' Cowboys, as of writing this review.

If you think thats because i enjoy the game, youd be... partially right!

Let me explain my experience.
Open the game. Of course. Play game, also of course. I'm talking to the characters and having a pretty good time! Theyre all interesting and fun to talk to, funny, overall well rounded! At least at first. 
Eventually you keep playing and you realize youre getting nowhere fast. You've romanced all the characters, but you know that isnt all there is to the game. Where are all the scenarios I'm missing? Are these few routes all there is to the game?

No! The issue is, um, theres no tutorial or explanation on what to do. And it'd seem obvious, go around talking to people and whatnot, but the issue is that for new players this system just isnt intuitive. To get certain specific character interactions you have to talk to specific characters in a specific order with specific responses. I thought it was just a me being stupid issue, but on the community here you can see others being confused too. This sucks majorly because theres so much stuff to see, but so many players may not have seen it all.

It might be better if the way you unlock new scenarios was interesting, but all you'll really be doing is banging different characters in different orders. With the same dialogue. And the same artwork. It's not really fun... Like seriously, you'll be seeing the same sex scenes over. and over. and over again. Just to get new sex scenes...? This game is nsfw, i get it, but that doesnt excuse the lack of variety to be seen. It also doesnt help that some of the art is really basic and not really interesting to look at over and over. If youve played you know the ones

This became really grating as I went on trying to get all the routes. Its unfortunate too because most routes focus on the same few characters. You'd better hope your favorite is Jak or Dijon, because they make up a majority of dialogue. Dont get me wrong, they are great characters! But theres so many others that are pushed to the wayside for seemingly no reason. You like Jade? She has one short little romance route and then in all others she dies. Magnolia? Much the same. Theres a difference between having main characters and whatever this is.
It also feels weird because the characters with the least dialogue and intrigue are the women... Jade especially is done dirty as the one trans character who also so happens to have the least amount of dialogue. Let our ladies have some more interactions, please? 

I could also go on about the grind that is 100%ing this game with all the money you have to collect and all the stuff you have to cook, but that's all optional, so it isnt a big deal but man it would be nice if the snake minigame gave you a liiiittle more money.

Speaking of money, 9$ for Courtin' Cowboys... Is it worth it? Wuhhhhh I dunnoooo... Im gonna say yes? I did really enjoy the characters, theyre the main driving point for me. If I hadnt got Courtin Cowboys I wouldve missed out on these guys that I actually really enjoy and continue to pine for. Even if the game drove me crazy trying to pry more content out of it... Id get it again. ""This better not awaken anything in me..."" 
(it did)
Typically don't play games with dark kinks, but I love a visual novel that adds extra fun stuff like character creation and mini games. Gave it a try and soon realize that this page wasn't lying when it said it wasn't like typical other dating games. 
You don't woe a character week by week by week, then get a cinematic ending. 
You end up talking to them one or two times, and soon are doing the dirties with them.
Each of the characters have their own lil personalities, some more charming than the others-some more mysterious that give hints that this world has a dark otherworldly presence that makes me sooo sad we don't learn more about. 
 The REAL fun is literally ""f*cking around and finding out""-who you choose to court first might have certain(NERVOUS LAUGH) reactions to you courtin others. 
Experimenting who to sleep with, choosing different options in a character's routes, and discovering these events were very addicting and traumatizing. lol  Few of the complains I have is definitely the mini games, the snake game drags a bit and I have to mute the game and put my playlist with upbeat music so I don't zone out. And I don't know if it's cause I suck at the fishing game, but soo many times I end up running out of time before filling the bar. Cutting the bar down or making it that you get a fish every time but it's quality is depended on how far the bar is filled would have saved my slow ass. Clicking the berry bush, getting one random berry. then being kicked back out of the berry area is tedious to do over and over again until your energy runs out. Instead, the three bushes should be different  options on how many berries you want to collect, first one being 3 berry with the average energy cost, second being like 5 with half your energy , and last being 9-10 with all your energy cost or something.  
But other than the mini games and the short gameplay- if we ever get more Courtin Cowboy content I will slap my credit card on the table. Repeatedly. It's a dating sim with dark mysteries and cowboys. What not to love about it?

The story is really intresting and the different routes keep you busy. The art style is also great. I really hope to see more games like this! I wake up, I think about florence... I go to sleep, I think about florence.... (fishing rhythm game is also extremely addictive) Good.",0.09899941758375491

Sokobos is a minimalistic &amp; challenging puzzle game that expands on the classic block-pushing formula.,"Very fun sokoban puzzle game. Do recommend! I have to admit to feeling proud for finally finishing this Ancient Greeks-themed sokoban game, but not because I've demonstrated great prowess or procedural insight - no, I'm proud because I've doggedly persevered for more than 49 hours spread over nearly a year to complete 90 levels (base game and DLC) in spite of my many false starts and failed strategies! So many times I've had the end of a level apparently in my grasp, only to realise that there's a fatal flaw. But the eventual successes were sweet, and never did I feel that the game itself was at fault, just my lack of skill and foresight. In fact, I found Sokobos to be a very clever and attractive game, with some novel mechanics (like having to make pieces the right colour by moving them over areas of paint), and with appropriate overarching mini-stories (building & decorating a temple, and negotiating a maze to try to get Aphrodite's approval for a marriage). All credit to the developer for producing very tricky but somehow compelling (rather than off-putting or discouraging) levels. Great devilish little puzzles that are satisfying to complete.  It rapidly throws in some complexity and difficulty, but never impossible - undo is unlimited, you can save your place and there is no time limit, so you can ""try, try again"" and it's really just a matter of getting your moves in the right order. Soothing yet challenging game.
Good level design, on point graphics with a nice atmosphere.
Recommended and worth the price. The game fully delivers on its promise to expand the classical Sokoban aka pushing blocks.
There's a lot of cool and interesting mechanics such as painting blocks, rotating them.
What I really like is that you don't just push boxes around instead you are assembling pillars, statues, benches, etc.

The art style is unique, reminds me of Baba Is You a little but most importantly it is very clear and readable. The story is also a very nice addition, especially for the Sokoban genre.

Easy recommend, especially for the low asking price, can't wait to play more. Very good puzzle game. Worth every cent you should buy it. The DLC is equally worth it. I've barely scratched the surface and already managed to get great challenges on early levels, but I already know I'll stay with this production for longer.
Great level design, artstyle very well fits itself in each aspect.
More games like this! Very nice Sokoban game with a few interesting mechanics!
Another great puzzle game by Daisy Games.
Definitely recommended, if you like Sokoban. Great Sokoban with a cool Greek theme. The game ramps up quick with absolutely brutal puzzles that'll leave you feeling like a genius when you solve them. Definitely worth checking out! Great game, quite hard. Neat style.",0.1775783972125436

1227360,Fighting Clans,game,False,"3 Mar, 2020","Action, Indie, Simulation, Early Access","A true, FIRST VR Street Fight! You‚Äôre just a regular guy, doing your best to get by, but you made your choices and now you‚Äôre in debt to the mafia. The only way you are going to save yourself is to fight. Prepare to engage in combat with no limits, no rules. You fight to win, you win to survive.","i take it back i hate it theres no street fighting moves that you can do, even though it was advertised that you could do them. the enemy just blocks everything and barely reacts to your punches, resulting in you having to do stupid shit to beat them. Abandonware. I only need 5 minutes to see how bad this game is.

First off, there are only 3 settings - Texture Quality, Post Processing Off or On and Effects. No sound, no shadows, shaders, model quality, no control remapping - nothing.

Secondly, there's no indication that the ""other"" modes aren't there or anything. You try to select them and nothing happens - so why not put a note saying ""These are not in the game yet""?

Now, into the fighting - you are thrown in with no tutorial, no guidance, nothing. You have to figure out how to play this game yourself.

So there's me, wondering what do I do? I use the left stick, I can't move, I use the right stick, I can't turn around??? How come the enemy gets the ability to go around me but I don't get that same luxury?

The indicators of whether or not you've done damage or how much aren't there. You punched him but... Did it hit him? Did it hurt him? If so, how much did it hurt???

Then, there's the controls. You are not told what each button does but when you use it, it's still confusing. The only thing I figured out is that the face buttons on the right controller do a right kick (a detached foot comes up) and for the face buttons on the left one, you do a left kick. But both buttons work - is one a lower kick and a higher kick??? There's really no way to tell since it happens so fast.

Then there's also the indication that you are ""tired"" which is just a heavy breathing noise. Not sure how I'm meant to tell at what point I can't kick/punch, but apparently I'm meant to.

It also appears to be abandoned by the devs, who are updating a new game that they've released instead of finishing their current one.

Overall, I'd say this could be fun with polish, clear guidance and better design, but in the end it lacks all of those. If the developers want input they should contact me and I'd provide feedback. In a nutshell, the concept of the game is the only worthwhile part. The mechanics are completely unrealistic and totally not responsive. It's waaay too easy and punches are thrown and then land out of sync in totally unrealistic ways. I beat the entire game in less than 20 minutes, first try (and you probably will, too). The developers should try to get in touch with whoever made Thrill of the Fight. Those mechanics are the best I've experienced. I would not by this game unless some major work is done to improve the realism and responsiveness. As a lifelong martial art practitioner I enjoyed the simple gameplay and a real adrenaline rush associated with a sparring. Good cardio workout too. Looking forward to it being developed further; took me less than an hour to get through all the opponents, including generous breaks between fights. Attempted to play through this to find there is no locomotion nor turning so, I spent most of my time in game dangerously close to beating a wall. No instructions whatsoever, tried every button and couldn't manage to figure out how to kick.
I enjoyed the grappling of arms but it wouldnt last long due to my enemies always backing out of my reach, then when they come back into range I get hit by a series of unblockable attacks.
I love fighting games and I'd love to see this one improved upon later, but as it is now, its a swinging match. This is the best vr game in terms of price / quality. I recommend everyone to play this indie masterpiece at least once. This game is a let-down. The mecanics are non-intuitive and slow, and the game content is limited to 3 opponents, who are +/- identical. A let-down for sure, compared to e.g. ""Thrill of the Fight"". its a good game not much wrong with it, i suggest this to others who like this style",0.0026656582054309388

35138,Lara Croft GoL: Hazardous Reunion - Challenge Pack 3,dlc,False,"7 Jan, 2011","Action, Adventure","Four new challenge maps featuring mind-boggling puzzles, waves of intense combat action, and a fiery reunion with an old friend.","This time we get 2 more horde maps with high scores to clear, one puzzle area to finish within 2 minutes and a chase sequence where a fish boss is following you. To get the objective there you need to collect enough points through gems you find along the way. This challenge pack is considerably more challenging than the previous 2. The horde maps are timed and very hectic. You‚Äôre basically forced to move around and keep a certain rhythm instead of cheesing it compared to the previous horde maps. Likewise, the chase map also got chaotic and very hectic. The puzzle area was very good, the kind that makes you feel smart once you finish it. But it does get a bit frustrating/challenging when you try to finish it within 2 minutes for the objective. 

This third pack seems like a natural conclusion in terms of being the most challenging pack and ending it with a boss. It was fun but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the best since I enjoyed challenge pack 2 a lot. It‚Äôs still worth looking into when it‚Äôs on sale and you want more Lara Croft. This ""Challenge Pack"" provides Four Challenge Tombs (2 Combat, 1 Puzzle and 1 ""Hazard Traversal""):
[h1]Leglion's Lair[/h1]
Combat map with many large spike crusher traps which you can trigger and use to your advantage. Overall this combat arena doesn't really do anything different to the others, the only main difference here is that the arena is spider themed.
(""Leglion"" was an optional Boss battle in level 3: Spider Tomb)
[b]Note that combat arena tombs are quite simple as they have none of the following features:[/b]
Remaining enemy counter, Wave counter or a method to view your past high scores whilst playing the map.
[h1]Puzzle Soup[/h1]
The ONLY Puzzle map in this DLC and while it is good and definetely the trickiest of the DLC Puzzle tombs, it is still very short and doesn't introduce anything new like the Puzzles in the previous challenge pack (See ""Blast Lifts"" from my previous review). I enjoyed this Tomb apart from the final ""puzzle"" in the level.
[h1]Firefighters[/h1]
The final Combat map! This one is by far the most difficult and takes place in a Lava Arena with Small Mazes, Rotating Flamethrowers and delayed activation fire tiles. The Traps in this Tomb are very deadly to the enemies as well as the player themselves. Moving around the map is a must, as the tankier enemies will crowd and corner you very quickly. Ensure that you have already maxed out Relics, Artifacts and collected all weapons before attempting this map! I enjoyed this map but feel like it throws far too many enemies at you too quickly without time to gather ammo/health. This lack of breathing room makes the map much more stressful than it should have been.
[h1]Lava Chompy[/h1]
The final DLC map is a Hazard navigation tomb very similar to the ""Jaws of Death"" map from the main game. In fact, the boss from that level is reskinned here! (He has a very cool cracked molten lava style)
Difficulty-wise, this is easily the HARDEST tomb in the entire game (Including all the DLC). The clunky keyboard movement and ridiculous knockback from enemy projectiles will get you killed far MORE than the usual honest slip ups. I have no issues with any of the other maps in this game, but the difficulty spike in this tomb was absolutely insane. I recommend playing in Co-op, if you can be bothered. But I honestly would not recommend this final map to anyone who wants a fair and suitably challenging experience, as that is NOT what you will receive.
[h1]Overall Rating: 5/10 - Length of content = 18 to 30 minutes[/h1]
Puzzle Soup and Firefighters were the highlights for me. The other two maps were either too generic or plain unfair to enjoy.
Overall, I would recommend this pack solely to enjoyers of the combat in this game, as puzzle-wise, this Challenge Pack sucks (Only 1 [i]mediocre[/i] tomb).
If you enjoy Combat or Puzzles, I would recommend the following Challenge Packs:

That's all I have to say. And this isn't the good type of challenging it's the bad type of challenging. 3 of the 4 challenges are pretty hard and are very hard to get the Top Challenge Spot. I like challenging but not like this. I'd say only get it if it's on Sale but I will Reccomend it simply because the Level Design is nice and it does offer great replay value, once you get the hang of how challenging these are.

It also has easy achievements, however I would not recommend buying this game at full price, as it is quite expensive and goes onto 90% sale often. Animals Memory: Horses.

+ Easy completion. Animals Memory: Horses is a card game with pictures of different horses that will test your memory. The aim of the game is to find pairs of cards.

Game features:
- Different levels of difficulty. From simple to complex.
- 30 cards with images of horses.
- It develops memory and is suitable for children of all ages, babies, preschoolers, school children, teenagers and adults.
- 18 levels. Ranging from lightweight to large and complex levels.

The horses can easily be distinguished between others with a couple having similar colors, but differing positions which made it slightly helpful.

2341130,The Turgenev Study,game,False,"19 Oct, 2023",Action,"A unique arena game of dodging, harvesting and assimilating enemies under a microscope with a relaxing soundtrack.","Cute little arcade game. Worth buying if you're interested in a unique spin on retro rogue-lites. I also recommend checking out Punkcake's other works; I really enjoy Shotgun King and Ecstatic. I think this game is a good example of how you can come up with a novel concept for a game not just by thinking what the player can do, but what they have to react to. The Turgenev Study was apparently part of a larger project where games had to have some sort of mechanic that revolved around it happening every ten seconds. It's this weird feeling where a game has action but it feels so relaxed at the same time, and having a mechanic that simultaneously defeats enemies while setting up for getting their abilities is fantastic. A single play session will likely last under three minutes or less until you get better at it, so yeah, it's hard, but still highly enjoyable to play.

High Score is currently 958 pts at wave 37. ooh this is intriguing
i like the theme and atmosphere If someone's complaining about this game and hasn't played for at least an hour, they quite simply don't know what they're talking about! (note: I've played for several hours on the itch version, I just bought it again on steam to support the devs!)

Punkcake are masters of making utterly unique -- mechanically as well as stylistically -- hopelessly addictive (""in a good way"") gems, and this is another one of them. Just tons of smart little ideas, all intertwined, in a beautiful package. It starts very simple, and incrementally gets more complicated, forever (or at least, for a very long time -- I'm stuck on mission 15 or something). If you're bored of the missions, try playing for a highscore; it is, after all, an arcade-action game at the core.

If only there was a thumbstick-based control option, my stupid mouse-based RSI wouldn't be hurting so much. ;-; Punkcake's MO generally leads to all of their games (barring Shotgun King) to having this weird ""undercooked"" vibe to them, and The Turgenev Study is no exception to that issue. Don't get me wrong: the visuals and sound design are absolutely perfect and the ""play and work out the mechanics"" concept actually *functions* here unlike in Metavaxx... but man there's just this constant feeling that this game could be so much more than it is. 

So get this, you're this weird lil harvesting microbe trying to chomp down some tasty bacteria to research it. You got enemies that just constantly get in the way by not doing any damage to you but bumping you around, you got enemies that slowly creep over to you, enemies that rush you once you harvest something, enemies that just rush you in general always, the list goes on. Despite the general appearance of the game, it's NOT a ""survive as long as you can"" game (although you can play it that way), but rather a game where you are given three objectives and asked to complete them over the course of several games. Once those are complete, you unlock a new enemy type, or a new mechanic, and gain another three objectives. It works really well!

The problem is the game doesn't quite convey that properly for one thing but also you can only take two hits full stop before your game ends. Sure, you can unlock an enemy type that will give you more health but (a) that requires you to complete the THIRD (!) objective set, and (b) you have to not only harvest them once but then assimilate them just to gain one (1) extra set of two hits. You WILL die a lot in this game. The AI is *vicious*, and its not helped by the insane amount of ""drone"" enemies that can and will bounce you to the other side of the miniscule arena (which remains miniscule even once you expand it, frankly.) It's...frustrating. I want to progress but rarely am able to purely because its so obscenely difficult out the gate for no real reason and its completely at odds with its otherwise really pleasant and calming atmosphere.

I love it *purely* on the fact that they absolutely nailed the sheer style of this game, it's absolutely gorgeous and feels like a ""bit Generations"" game from the GBA. I just wish it would get more time to cook so it's not as actively annoying to play. Very more-ish. the game was fun but in a hour there was a glitch that caused the game to be stuck on a black screen and it wont go away even after unstalling and restalling  please fix this uhhhh....i started playing and time traveled 5 hours into the future...BE CAREFUL!",-0.007661306947021233

An example of improvise gone-wrong-> Me:""Sorry I didn't know I can do that"" >>> Game:""I can do whatever I want""
 Played on quest 3 through steam link, gtx 1080 (not ti)

A small immersive Sim lite game with a ton of emphasis on player choice. Branching dialogue options that can actually impact the story, as can your actions in gameplay.

Gameplay is first person, there are FPS mechanics but combat is avoidable depending on how you want to handle it.

Voice acting is for the most part really good (there's one monotone character- it might be on purpose). There's a nice diversity to the voices that first the theme of the game too -if your a fan of the next generation like I am you might like this game.

The lore is initially confusing (by design) but it gets spelled out as you progress and you have access to a database which is....dense, and I feel it could be organised better but it's not essential to the game and I barely used it, this is where the bulk of the controversial ai art can be found. 

The graphics are basic at best... But found it ran extremely well even on my aging rig, so this could easily be a plus. I never felt sick apart from one moment I got turned around in an optional maze.

There's an optional voice command system that allows you to speak out dialogue choices. On the default setting I didn't like reading this out verbatim as it broke the immersion but turn down the recognition setting and you can ad-lib the line to what feels natural and this was so much fun for immersion. I found it didn't work all of the time but most of the time.

As mentioned it's a small game but I feel the joy is in the replay ability and in failing/succeeding in  different ways.

Looking forwards to the sequel. This game is really fantastic so far. If you're looking for a run-and-gun shooter this isn't it, but if you're looking for a really cool immersive story to ""live"" through this is the game. I haven't completed it yet, and there are some controls that are a little rough around the edges (looking at you hand-orientation that uses primary hand and not the hand with the movement thumbstick).

So far this game has been great though. It's a futuristic murder mystery, and the incorporation of being able to speak your lines really brings it to life. There were moments that I honestly felt like I was really speaking to the characters, and it really helped to uphold the suspension of disbelief. 

If I make it through the whole thing and find something glaring I'll update the review, but 1.4 hours in and so far it's been quite a stellar experience. Really interesting game and talking via microphone works great! üòÑ

I'm a bit of a visual novel enjoyer, and I've had several I like, dislike, and just managed to push through.
This one was genuinely one of the best I've played, and wish it got more of the recognition it deserves.
Our MC (Sable) isn't a blank slate, but has enough options it can still feel like you're living through his life. The side characters don't fall into being simple tropes, but rather each feel like a fleshed out person, and despite which route you follow, everyone remains relevant throughout the story. I have nothing but fond memories of my time exploring every route. Wholeheartedly recommend, sale or not.

it is such a low cost and the roadmap is looking good. I hope the game does it and reaches the targets. All the basics are there for something good.

Buy it if you love Command and Conquer. broken, cant select anything through task windows.  theres no action menus, cant build anything/do anything. I can't recommend this game, in all honesty.

It's bogged down with poor pathing, terrible AI, and 20 year old graphics.

The voices are terrible and annoying after only 5 minutes.

The tech tree isn't at all interesting, despite being exceptionally limited.  

All units die like lvl 1 scouts in any other game would.   The turrets cannot traverse quickly enough to fire on most enemies, not just the fast-moving ones, and even with a wall of turrets, shield generators, and heavy tanks, you'll suffer significant losses in an average attack against your defensive lines.

The variety of units is more limited than the variety of buildings that you can make, which is ridiculous in such games.

The controls are terrible.  Repairing buildings may or may not work.  Your builders may or may not respond to instructions to build, and often just disregard build orders for some buildings while building others.  

All in all, this feels like an alpha build of a home-brewed game.  When I saw the demos, I was reminded of Cavedog's ""total annihilation"" and was extremely hopeful.  Instead, this is like the games that I used to see in the $5 bargain bin at a game shop and would try out, only to uninstall and dispose of.

I'll be refunding this game, and never looking back.

*edit:  I'm still baffled why a game that was released more than a year ago is still listed as ""early access"". Game visuals are good, but is very unbalanced. 

There are two factions in this game. The Andarer and the Redaxh.  The Andarer are the typical shield and arty faction (in theory). The Redaxh are alians with a big end game walker thing and tanks that shoot energy balls. 

When playing I noticed that the Andarer can build way more early game units than the Redaxh can and can easily overrun other factions with light tanks. Which seems a little odd since they are the ones with the tech to get arty. The Redaxh is dependant on one of the three resources so much that their early game is extremely limited until they get their tech center up and get some eco upgrades.

The problem comes in with how the projectiles work for the units. The Redaxh units all shoot slow projectiles including their defense towers. So the Andarer can just build 8 light tanks and go kill everything as long as the player micros good enough. It does not really matter what the enemy has, your tanks can move so fast that nothing can hit them. The starting workers are all ground units so you just micro past any defenses that the enemy has and just kill the eco and then you have won the game at that point. I found that when playing the Andarer that I had to just put limits on the light tanks that I can build and just not build them if i wanted the game to go past 7-10 minuets of stomping the opponent. Even in the end game you can just spam them because the cost is so cheap that you just over run the enemy base with this. 

The eco is not good for early game Redaxh and the light tank for Andarer is ridiculous, so I thought lets build some heavy tanks and see if it does the same thing. (Also tried this with Redaxh units and it work to some degree against the Andarer, but to a lesser degree because the projectile speed is higher for the Andarer units, so it is not as effective but still works.)
Yep! Just wiggle your units around a bit and all the projectiles miss you from enemy units and defense turrets. There needs to be something that allows the enemy to hit units that are quick. AOE seems to be an answer, but you really don't get any until later in the game for both factions. 

The air units can kind of be a counter, but again the projectile speed is so slow that you can not really touch anything if the opponent is paying attention at all and is moving their units. Also air is expensive to get and you will get run over fast if that is what you are using as defense early game. Gunships will not allow you to stop the enemy from killing off all of your eco. You can just run past them and ignore the air and then just go kill all of the opponents workers, and then they have no money to build anything else so an instant win there. 

This seems like the unit models and scale would work for a tower defense game, but in a game where you can micro units it does not work. The projectile speed needs to be adjusted for defenses as well as for the Redaxh units. I am mediocre at best at RTS games and I got board really quick with how the fights played out. 

It seems like a good game to keep on your watch list, but until there is some more polish with the unit balance and eco balance, and perhaps some more units added to the game (something to put a slow area effect on the enemy to make the projectiles have a chance to hit?) then I recommend other games such as Red Alert, Forged Alliance Forever, or Age or Empires, or Star Craft. Very unpolished but decent.  Very basic Classic RTS, doesnt have much flavor but im gonna vote it up because it is a solid return to the basics for old farts like me.  Im sure itll be good when finished. Great game with lots of potential. It makes some things different that really bothered me in other RTS games. I am excited for the upcoming addition of multiplayer and the developer team's ambitious plans for the game. The dev team is also easy acessibil over discord so you can get them feedback, they are really nice team and it's rare to see this level of engagement and dedication from a developer team. Overall, I highly recommend checking it out. Summary: A lot of potential and similarities with ""Command and Conquer"" and ""Supreme Commander"", the graphics are ok, no multiplayer for the moment, it lacks optimization and has some bugs, but if they add more stuff it will be a lot of fun. If you can afford it, buy it, help this game to mature as a good RTS!

At the time of this review the game was just released as early access 2 days ago, I played the demo first and as I saw potential I bought it. 
The game clearly lacks a lot of content, but it already has some basic things, and the essence of the game I liked a lot, reminding me of Command and Conquer (as many say), but more than anything it reminded me of my hours and hours of Supreme Commander, a game I love and highly recommend.

For being made by such a small development team, the game is great and I hope they can keep improving it and adding content, since at the moment you can only play with 2 factions and in single player skirmishes against the AI, and a mode to resist waves. No multiplayer for the moment. I found 2 or 3 bugs but it is understandable for the magnitude of the project.

The game lacks optimization, playing in a 2vs2 game, when about 20 minutes have passed and there are many units in the game, the game begins to lose fps abruptly, and in some moments the units take about 5 seconds to respond to movement orders. 

The above described happened to me with the graphics in ""Very Low"" and 1920x1080 resolution, and the RAM consumption of the game was around 11 GB. If I raised the graphic quality I saw that it even required 17 GB of RAM.

Here are my specs for reference:
OS: Windows 10 x64
Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 5600x
Memory: 32 GB of RAM
Graphics: Nvidia GTX 1050ti (4GB of VRAM)

I send my best wishes to the development team so they can continue with the project, I can't wait to be able to play the full game! Solid RTS, like a Mix from Starcraft and Command and Conquer. Has a lot of potential.
Im looking forward for future updates and the multiplayer. The KI is very intelligent and is hard to beat - TRY IT!",0.023092585519056127

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Fight a counter-insurgency war, protect the civilian population, casevac your wounded and decide how the world sees your struggle. And remember - no one gets left behind.","The AI IS SO BAD. I have NEVER in my life seen AI so bad. Running pointlessly in circles, running into burning HUMVEE wreckage, weird pathing issues, crouching and panicking without taking any cover first, it's ridiculous. The game is very unfinished and doesn't seem to be actively developed. unfinished dead game I understand this is EA, but i cant recommend it for 18.99. I havent been able to functionally leave the starting area in an hour of play time. The UI, pathfinding, and AI is pretty abysmal. Its clunky. Units and vehicles get stuck on everything and my guys shoot like they are blindfolded with arms made of jello. Updates are very infrequent. Its an awesome concept of a game, and I hope to see it further its development, but it needs too much work to recommend in its current state. Unless you're going to actively contribute to the game via feedback/testing and communicating with the dev, this game is currently frustrating in its current state.

-AI will get stuck on parked/disabled cars.
-Current missions are given out right at the start of the game that might be overwhelming if you're starting out.
-There's too much micro management, I wish this was more squad based controls/instructions and maybe controlling individual units when you want something specific.
-UI is also frustrating, I have to move medics away from a wounded/disabled person after stabilizing to pick them up, since your pointer focus will always go to the medic instead of the wounded person. Its been about 5 years, while this type of game has a ton of potential. I cannot suggest buying it as it has been virtually unsupported in that time, and when updates do come out it fixes one thing and breaks another lol game's as good as dead and very unfinished Cannot possibly recommend.

     The pathfinding is absolutely dire. I have lost count of the number of times men and vehicles have gotten stuck. The AI is a joke, both enemy and friendly. The UI keeps breaking, with the sub-missions overgrowing the unit orders panel, forcing you to use the contextual command wheel. The contextual command wheel thing is awful and will take years off of your life, I honestly just wanted to turn it off the entire time. And worst of all this is one of those games that confuses ""realism"" with being as pedantic as it possibly can. This is one of the most tedious RTS games I have ever played. As an example, to build a building you have to;

1. Send a truck to the off map HQ
2. Wait a minuet for it to get there
3. Manually order it to load with building supplies
4. Order it into a convoy
5. Pick out the driver
6. Order the convoy to to return to the AO
7. Wait a minuet for the truck to get back
8. Order the truck to the build site (remember to watch it the whole way or else it WILL get itself stuck!)
9. Order the truck to unload the building supplies
10. Order a soldier to build the building (you WILL need to keep an eye on him or he will just give up half way)
11. Realize that the largest cargo truck you have doesn't carry enough materials to finish the building, so you are going to have to repeat the process!

     It is a similar process for Evacuating wounded, taking prisoners, and supplying locals with aid. Does this make the game feel more authentic? No. Does it make the game harder, Not really. Just really really tedious. When a game spawn camps you and forces you to restart multiple times without even being able to leave the starting area, one must wonder if it is a skill issue or a game issue.

Clearly a skill issue, I should've dodged the RPG fire right out of the gate and smoked the 40 insurgents and growing with my elite team of 8 Not worth your money:

In this case there is no music on puzzle screens, just horror sounds like screams, rattling, and other ‚Äúspooky‚Äù noises. All of the puzzle pieces float around in the side panels and you can place them or move them as needed. There is a rotation mechanic that can be turned off in the options. You can view the puzzle picture for a quick moment with a key press. There are a total of 25 puzzles to solve.
[h3] PLAYTIME [/h3]
The early game is not very complicated however when you get to the third and fourth tier puzzles you are looking at 220, and 350 piece puzzles respectively. Play time is ~4-6 hours to get all achievements and complete all puzzles. 
[h3] COMPLAINTS [/h3]
There is nothing specific to complain about for this game.
[h3] REPLAYABILITY [/h3]
There is NO replayability on this game as there is no end game mechanics or puzzle randomness.
[h3] RECOMMENDATION [/h3]
I recommend this game to anyone that likes puzzles, people looking for holiday themed games, and to achievement hunters when the game is on sale. When I finally completed this game a sudden horrifying feeling crept over me as I had come to realise that there was NO STEAM BADGE!

Also some of the images were low res and the music was annoying but the shocker at the end there got me good. The same game as the other Pixel Puzzles game just with different art, and I have enjoyed playing through these puzzles. I bought it cheap in the complete bundle so it was good value. Some fun and spooky puzzles to complete near Halloween! I loved this franchise ever since it came to steam.
Sure, there's a couple of flaws in the core design.
You simply can't snap individual pieces together.
And you sadly can't use your own pretty images.
Therefore: You are stuck with the default puzzles.
Everybody really knows these flaws at this point.
But I honestly do love these jigsaw experiences.
It simply feels great to finish every single puzzle.
During a discount it's definitely worth a purchase.
Also: I really like playing Pixel Puzzles: Ultimate.
I thought this game might give me a DLC for that.
The older Pixel Puzzles games did give the DLC.
But unfortunately: This game just isn't doing that.
Don't buy this if you are expecting that free DLC.
I still enjoyed it, but I was a tiny bit disappointed. I love the soothing sounds of screaming in the middle of July <3 Recommended. I'm honestly really disappointed with this one.

I love Halloween and its whole aesthetic, and I enjoy the gameplay of pixel puzzles games. This game just feels so lazy tho, like compared to pp zombies which had cool sometimes, genuinely creepy artwork, this game has just photos. and they're mostly pretty lame photos too. pictures of cookies, pumpkins, graveyards, ect. it's not terrible imagery and as puzzles they're mostly fine,  but it's far from exciting. I have similar issues with the pp ultimate halloween dlc packs but at least that's not a full game 

there's also the issue of limited profile features meaning that this game, though easy to 100%, doesn't count at all to your steam profile. It's a small issue and obviously steam achievements and profile completion are meaningless but it just gives even less reason to care about an already kind of mediocre puzzle game. This one's got the Pixel Puzzles mechanics, which are good. Too bad they did so little with the theme as these deviate wildly into just horror instead of Halloween. The major issue though is in the sound design, or lack thereof. The only music is at the title/puzzle select screen. Otherwise, its just random horror noises on a loop. After finishing this game, I can say that it was disappointing in more ways. Two of the largest puzzles were not challenging in a fun way, but rather frustrating due to muddled details in a field of similar pieces.",-0.0789008353756556
409580,No1Left,game,False,"19 Feb, 2016","Action, Indie, RPG, Early Access","Before purchasing, please note that this is a hardcore survival game and it is currently in an incomplete, early alpha phase. Some things might not work properly or the way you might expect them to.","There is no1left to work on this game. It has been abandonned. Buying this was a total waste of my precious money. It was 16 Euros at the time when I bought it. I could have done a lot nicer things with that money. Like buying a pizza, a coke or a sky veteran medal. F*ck this game. needs some work as low content, until this has further updates I would avoid. Given no updates since feb i'm not happy. There is good material here for a futur gem, and here some of what i think should be added, or improved.

To add :

-Skill tree, experience gain and level up.
-Events on the map
-More zombie types (maybe zombie dogs and cats too)
-More detail on the map, variety (different sorts of trees, nice grass, lots of new objects, broken cars in the streets, etc etc etc)
-More weapons, especially snipers (with scope), rocket launcher, flamethrower, grenades.
-More energy for the character by default, to be able to run more.
-Night and day cycle
-Better procedurally generated system (some zones are empty).

If the dev adds already all this, the game will become fantastic.

Oh and for sure, cards and achievements too.

<3 Keep up the good work !! the first minute i played this i wanted a refund
 [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5axmA3qPIc] Even for alpha, this is pretty omega... [/url] 

Short version: DON'T buy this right now. It's got a lot of work that needs done on it before it's playable.

Long version: As a concept, a top-down voxel zombie survival game with RPG elements sounds pretty cool. This game is far from being anywhere NEAR a game.

Graphically, it's a decent looking game for being in alpha. That's about the only thing going for it, though.

Sound-wise, it's completely lackluster. The zombies are acceptably voiced, but the lack of any background music makes it a dull experience. The controls are a bit iffy, having to aim your mouse in the direction you want to go WHILE moving WASD in the same direction. It would be a hell of a lot better if W was forward, S was down, etc.

Gameplay is incessantly difficult. To pick up anything, you have to go to no less than two menus. This makes it extremely difficult to pick anything up if there's even one zombie on the screen. At that, you can't even use weapons at this point in development. So, unless there's some engineering things to do, you're pretty much screwed.

Honestly, I wouldn't buy this game. It's too early to have been released for anything but a free alpha demo. Don't be like me and blow nine-and-change on a barely functioning game. Give it a few months and revisit. 1. You can't pick anything up, you have to open up your inventory to see what's in the proximity so you can move it over to inventory.
2. You can't enter any buildings, but you can enter vehicles with no gas to drive anywhere.
3. Moving around is slow

Nice little puzzle game. Not very long, not very complicated, but enjoyable, Awesome puzzles! Deceptively simple. Gets more interesting in the second area. Do NOT buy this game at full price.

Well if you read the first sentance you might think this game is awful,well it isnt.The biggest problem this game has is thats for the majority easy or casual puzzler so if you exspect a challenge you will find only a half a dozen brainteasers.
This game could do so much more with the ideas and mechanics and thats the main problem.
Wonderful art style and very relaxing music.
For me this games pricetag is way to high when you take that the game offers little challenge.
 Clever and sometimes fiendish puzzle game, that keeps introducing game mechanics at a pace that doesn't become overwhelming, but builds on what you've learnt. Definitely recommend. Brilliant puzzle game, may become leader of the field within innovative puzzle games. Beautiful gameplay. The early levels are sweet and simple but soon enough you will start pulling your hair in frustration. Strong recommendation for this game if you're into braingames! Surprisingly good puzzle game, it was very satisfying to beat the later levels but never frustrating. Anyone who enjoyed games like Braid, Limbo, The Bridge etc... this is for you.

My only criticism would be that there were too many trivial instant-solve puzzles before reaching the challenges. 
Also, lack of music. A beautiful and engaging puzzle game. The game are engaging and thoughtfully designed and the various themes and audio provide a meditative backdrop for some fiendishly original and rewarding challenges.

Not sure what to compare it to... perhaps Zelda I and III on NES/SNES as you get multiple tools to help you in your quest and are encouraged to re-explore areas.  I played most of this on the steam deck and had zero issues though the top info bar and some text may be difficult to read.

The story is simple, but engaging.  Gameplay is simple too, but it's not just about recognizing patterns of your enemies, but keeping track of the buildings you enter, what you get, did you get stuck because of a missing item and need to come back later? 
I liked how there were multiple ways to obtain items or make things in buildings easier to deal with whether it be through brute forcing things, charming people, hacking computers, or just outright buy the item.

Some people might not like the art direction.  It looks like something out of Windows 3.1 or classic Flash games on Newgrounds.  But hey, that screams to me ""Retro"" and ""Old School"".
Some may find the adult humor a bit much, but I found it hilarious.

Two things I didn't care for - 
1) No real way to pause the action.  If you take a break, make sure you are on a screen with no enemies nearby (usually as you enter a new area), go to a safe building, or enter a dialog.
2) Walking off frame a bit is enough to respawn enemies.  Be careful.

Some Tips:
* Make sure you read the manual (shows up as additional downloaded content) for some good tips which I wish I noticed before jumping in.
* As the manual states, activate the cell phone tower when you can (talk to NPCs, they'll tell you what to do and where it is).
* Charisma attribute points can't be bought so work on this through level ups.  This also allows you to charm NPCs and lower costs.  Strength also can't be bought in the store, but there's a gym you can go to.  As the manual states, the Mind Attribute will be important but there are items that can help give you a boost.
* In each city there is a building with a bed.  Look for them and memorize where they are, you'll use them a lot.

All of this done by one individual, PDS.  Very impressive.  I'll be playing Daisy Flies to the Moon as it appears everything in connected in some way. You can kick yourself through walls. It's exactly as Ohio as I remember. 10/10 I haven't beaten those yet but so far it's been very enjoyable. I've actually gifted it to several friends. Classic sandbox game with beautiful old school graphics. Well written and very funny. Good amount of game play and open world exploring. Combat is simple and fun and the games not terribly easy. Great classic style game. i would've checked this as a non-recommendation if not for my desire to see them fix the control scheme and make a good final product. please developers, think about what you've done to the poor poor control scheme... it's a goddang war crime. like seriously even with a controller, it's just far too much of a drag and i personally can't play it like this. I love this game for it's retro look and feel, If you like Nes/Snes titles this game maybe right up your alley...I will say, the map in the game is rather large, once you leave the starting area and find your brother A fun game with an interesting story. Lots of dialogue. 

https://youtu.be/FyrpHJ0SWYs I gifted this game to a friend whose name was Elijah, lived in Ohio, and looked like the titular character in the game. I really enjoy playing this game and expect great things from this game in the future as updates and improvements start rolling out

503860,Patterna,game,False,"3 Oct, 2016",Indie,"Patterna is a logic puzzle game for people who think that HexCells is far too easy. It features a highly customizable random level generator, a level editor, more than 70 levels, and an enchanting minimalist soundtrack by Alex Cottrell.","Patterna is a wonderful logic game in the vein of Tametsi and Hexcells, but its rules can be a tad harder to grasp and the level design can be brutal.

If you thought the Hexcells series was difficult, you might want to skip this one, although to be fair I think that you can assess the game's approach to level design already by playing the demo.

Having progressed a bit into the game, though, I have to say that you CAN get better at it once you get the rules embedded in your brain, and the presence of a ""what if"" mode (accessible by pressing TAB) ensures that even in the worst cases you can try chipping away possibilities.

So, yes, Patterna is definitely on the tougher end of the difficulty scale for logic games, but that doesn't mean in any way that it's a bad game. I will also add that the game is sold at a low-ish price considering the amount of levels (not to count the randomly generated ones and the workshop ones). Delightfully devilish! If you dare brave the two circles of graph theory minesweeper hell, you'll come out with a surprising intuitive mix of several puzzle genres. Not for the uninitiated. Just wayyyy too convoluted and complex to be any fun.

Even if the mechanics are similar it's nothing like Hexcells or (most of) Tametsi. You go through the tutorials (which are like half the levels in the game) mostly fine, then the actual levels begin and you immediately hit the wall.

Every. Single. Level. You open it and basically stare at it for hours because there's bloody nothing you can do to progress at all. I feel like I must figure out and solve the whole level at once simultaneously every time. This includes making assumptions based on assumptions based on other assumptions to see if there's a pattern.

There's no drawing mode like what Tametsi has though. I've been ""solving"" levels by drawing over screenshots in MS Paint for a long while and it's simply not fun at all. Even when I do manage to understand and crack a level it doesn't feel rewarding at all. Because you click the next level and instantly run into another wall yet again.

Since nodes are not made of grids but rather graphs it is often incredibly hard to really understand what connects to what in the puzzle overall. I just find it next to impossible to truly perceive. And when one-way connections are involved it's basically kiss your gaming goodbye. Like, I code for a living, I know graphs, I've beaten Hexcells trilogy + Globesweeper + majority of Tametsi, yet here I spend most of the time just looking at an MS Paint screenshot slowly getting more and more sad and irritated. I don't see why I should endure it anymore or recommend anyone else to go through it either.

You probably came here because you want more of Hexcells or Tametsi. But it's not gonna be that. It's so, so much worse in terms of difficulty and fun. If you only played Hexcells you are not even remotely ready for this, and only if you totally breezed through Tametsi you might stand a chance. It seems that many people who left positive reviews didn't even remotely progress deep into the game either - except for a niche couple people who are clearly the target audience. But you aren't. :) Refreshing logic game, wish I found it sooner! Patterna is an enthralling logic puzzle game that captivates players with its unique blend of sophisticated challenges and an enchanting minimalist atmosphere. This gem pushes the boundaries of the genre, offering an experience that stands out from the crowd.

From the moment you begin, Patterna's charm is evident in its elegant and deceptively simple design. Each level presents a network of nodes that must be carefully analyzed and manipulated to progress. As you delve deeper into the game, you'll quickly realize that Patterna is a true test of logical reasoning, offering a refreshingly cerebral experience for those seeking a more intellectually stimulating puzzle game.

One of Patterna's standout features is its highly customizable random level generator, ensuring that players never run out of fresh challenges to tackle. With over 70 handcrafted levels to conquer, there's no shortage of content to keep your mind engaged and entertained. The inclusion of a level editor further extends the game's longevity, allowing players to design their own diabolical puzzles and share them with others.

Accompanying the cerebral gameplay is an enchanting minimalist soundtrack by Alex Cottrell, which perfectly complements the game's serene and contemplative atmosphere. As you progress through the levels, you'll find yourself fully immersed in Patterna's mesmerizing world, losing track of time as you focus on unraveling the intricacies of each puzzle.

In conclusion, Patterna is a must-play for fans of logic puzzle games seeking a fresh and invigorating challenge. Its unique blend of intricate gameplay, endless replayability, and captivating atmosphere make it a standout title in the genre. If you're ready to put your problem-solving skills to the test, look no further than Patterna ‚Äì an experience that promises hours of brain-teasing enjoyment. Stupidly complicated.  Maybe I'm just too dumb for this but I played Hexcells and Tametsi well and really tried with this one.  I feel I understand the rules completely based on the tutorials but then you get hit with a level and suddenly the rules don't seem to work anymore.  The rules are basically so complex that they can't even keep up with them enough to make them clear.  F*** this game. It's fun. There's tons of customization. The randomly generated puzzles are quite pleasant, and at max difficulty they can get pretty tough. Bonus points for the accessibility options, I was able to set all of the colors to be very easy to distinguish. I have to give this an upvote because it's a game and it works and that's really how low the bar is for these things. This game is honestly not that good. I'm almost all the way through the non-random puzzles and this game doesn't have any of the charm or appeal of Hexcells or Tametsi.

Play it if you enjoy puzzle games, but this is not even close to 'The Dark Souls of Hexcells'. This game is very... adequate. It's definitely not particularly good. Only get it if you found Hexcells too easy. [u]In short:[/u] Patterna is a challenging hard-logic puzzle game with a steep learning curve. The mechanics are varied and the replayability infinite, but it is very rough around the edges with poor and sometimes frustrating implementation. If you have a low tolerance for bad UI, stay away. If you can stomach that and are a seasoned veteran of logic games, Patterna is well worth buying at full price.

[u]In long:[/u] The developer himself compares Patterna's [b][u]mechanics[/u][/b] to Hexcells, and one can immediately see the inspiration. But Patterna is far from a knock-off, does its own thing and expands gameplay well beyond the scope of Hexcells. Nodes may be revealed or not, may be part of a pattern or not, may carry information about nodes around them up to a distance of 3, may describe the length of the chain they are part of, may have up to 4 colors, may be unlinked, linked or directionally linked, etc. The complexity is smart and truly awe-inspiring, but comes at a cost:
The learning and [b][u]difficulty[/u][/b] curve is very steep and almost nothing about the game seems intutive at first. Minesweeper and Hexcells have a simple elegance that is completely missing in Patterna. Right out of the gate you are inundated with new and abstract terminology (""pattern nodes"" vs. ""non-pattern nodes"") and the tutorial is lacking. From my understanding there used to be a more concise tutorial, but after expanding the game it has been spread out across several level packs. To me it appeared slow, disjointed and partly out of order. To be fair, the game offers pretty much every assistance you can think of: You can mark up to four nodes, which tints all nodes affected by them in different colors and you can switch to a planning mode, where you can temporarily mark nodes. These tools are almost required to use, since especially directional edges tend to produce some counter-intutive results.
The [b][u]levels[/u][/b] are a bit of a mixed bag. There are dozens of pre-made levels (took me about 12h to clear), organized in several sequences, but they mostly left me cold. A good chunk was very easy tutorials, a few were smart and fun and the rest were either focussed on mechanics I didn't enjoy or giganting sprawling mazes of directional edges, which basically required trial and error in planning mode, because there wasn't enough information to solve them step-by-step. But as even the developer has acknowledged on the forums, the pre-made levels were never intended to be the core of the game - the random level generator is! In fact, there are several different ones, which produce different kinds of node graphs. All generators are highly customizable in terms of size, difficulty and mechanics. It is actually incredibly impressive, how much variety and challenge they can produce. My only gripe is, that the difficulty settings are just very rough guides. Even low settings can occasionally produce incredibly complicated relationships requiring several minutes of high level reasoning. But in general the level generators are definitely one of the best I've ever seen and in over 50 hours of playtime with them I've never had the feeling anything repeated or that I had already seen all patterns. There is also a level editor, but Steam Workshop support is partly broken and years after the release there are a grand total of 6 levels published.

Which brings us to the implementation, and here arguably the game starts to fall apart quite a bit.
The [b][u]graphics[/u][/b] are barely passable, albeit completely functional. The Unity loader takes care of resolutions and windowed mode (window can also be drag-resized). I really like the [b][u]sound[/u][/b] effects and the music is decent (although naturally it will get old after 10 hours).
The [b][u]horrible UI[/u][/b] is one of the game's biggest weak points though. It is needlessly complicated and very overwhelming to someone who starts up the game for the first time. The main menu is just an overlay over the gameplay, which leads to strange behaviour, like being able to zoom the main menu background. Functionalities you'll often need are buried as deep in menus as ones you'll never use. Double click doesn't start a level, only the ""play"" button does. There's a neat graphical statistic at the end of each level that stopped working as soon as I started with randomly generated levels - but it still shows the meaningless data from dozens of hours ago everytime I beat a level. The ingame statistics keeping in general has very little useful data (level times seem to count intro and outro animations, some achievement related metrics are never shown, etc). I disagree with a lot of default choices, but the vast settings menu allows for amazing customization, from marking colors and depths to reversing controls and turning off certain animations. It took some time, but I was able to satisfy a lot of my needs. Some problems remain: If a hint is completely done, the game kicks you out of having it marked (jarring, but helpful), but does not automatically grey it out (why?). Every level starts and ends with a drawn out animation of every single node flying into and out of the screen. While neat at first, I found it to be enormously frustrating being forced to stare at the screen for 15 seconds for the literal 1000th time, when I just want to play the next level.
Speaking of staring at the screen, there are a few pretty bad [b][u]bugs[/u][/b]: Every half hour or so the game just freezes up for 10-20 seconds and becomes completely unresponsive, before continuing as if nothing happened. And after finishing a pre-made sequence you are kicked back to the main menu where a ""continue level"" button is still active, which reproducibly hardlocks/crashes the game. Together with the deprecated Workshop support, Patterna does not seem well maintained to me.

In [b][u]conclusion[/u][/b] this is a pretty classic example of a first release from a one-man operation. Patterna's developer definitely had a good idea and a firm grasp of mathematics/graph theory, but everything outside his skill-set, like graphics and UI, turned out to be pretty lacking if not awful. Still, the core gameplay is very solid and has infinite replayability. If you are bored by other logic games and you think you've seen it all, Patterna will rack your brain and keep you occupied for dozens of hours and the above-average asking price is very fair for that. Despite all its faults, I've had a lot of fun and don't regret my purchase one bit. If, however, you are new to logic games or if you value a polished experience, I cannot it good conscience recommend Patterna to you.",0.04246347053033095

Prefer to read?

100 Vacas is an arcade style, fast paced ""twin stick shooter"" where you play as a cowboy defending his farm from bandits. The game consists of a series of single-screen levels where every bullet matters because every dies in one hit, and your previous cows are likely to be shot by stray bullets. Precision and quick reflexes are key, and you will likely die a lot, but thankfully resets are fast enough that it's not painful.
This is a short and sweet experience, so don't expect a lot of depth here. It does come with a speedrun timer built for those wanting to put their skills to the test though!
I'd recommend picking it up on sale, as you'll likely get an hour or so of playtime from this one. Simple, satisfying, thematic and addictive. I feel like a cowboy. The ""save all cows to restore health"" mechanic is so cool and tense. Highly recommended! Isaac with cows except not really but its fun play it Buen arcade Fun and fresh arcade game with a completely ridiculous price (less than one euro, you have to buy it!). This is a simple and fun game. It's the kind of game that you can play while listening to podcasts, or whenever you have a few spare minutes to kill.

The gameplay is very polished, ensuring that the game never feels unfair despite being pretty challenging.

Considering how low the price is, it definitely gives you your money's worth. Really nice game. Easy to beat, but hard to master. The music, the graphics and the gamefeel combine in a wholesome experience. Its also fun and challenging. Would love it to include controller support. It is an incredible game, simple but challenging. I like the love with which all the details are made, music, effects, immersion, it does not even need a tutorial, you arrive and play, and it is part of the game.

I love it. This game totally worth every penny.

It's minimalist at all its sections: graphics, colors, ost, mechanics and duration.

But its playability is awesome, I really enjoyed it and has a well though-out level design. Nice ost too.

And when you finish it you want to improve and keep playing it. Lovely very well crafted challenging minigame. Give it a try !",0.13247354497354497

Pick up your rangs; pull on your shorts, and prepare to rescue the SOUTHERN RIVERS from a brand new threat - the QUINKAN..."," Classic 3D platformer that not many people got to play back in the day. As a person who got all Steam Achievements on the entire Quadrilogy, this was by far the hardest to get with this hardcore mode. What is missing is the extra hitpoint unlockable like from TY2 so you can take more damage before you die. It was a long journey but I highly recommend this game regardless of tone switch than games before It's more Ty 2 which is great if you liked that game.

Which means it continues on the poor level design decisions and all those flaws.

It does try to have a continuous story in this one and give more characters personality,but that can't save the boring gameplay. Also Dennis has a full on personality disorder in this game.

Both Ty 2 and Ty 3 make me sure that the devs were very confused on what type of game they wanted to make and with the level choices being the absolute worst in my platformer/collectathon history this series I am confused why it has so much positive reviews other than nostalgia I don't know what you could see in anything,but the first game.

You can now do a generic 3 hit combo with the rangs. Unfortunately most of the enemies require melee to be defeated. Please don't buy this game. Stick to the second game. Only thing I'M going to give credit for is the music. This soundtrack bops pretty hard. I think Krome Studios were smoking crack when they made this

2 levels in and it was diabolical. If its that rough at the start, I hate to think what the rest of the game is like.
I'll just pretend they only made Ty 1 & 2 lmao

- Rushed graphic animations
- Voice lines sounded weird from sentence to sentence
- Game-play felt weird compared to Ty 2

Maybe I'll try again in future I thought I would be deluded by this third chapter by what I've seen and heard about it, but instead it was amazing for the most part, except that I have to agree that some characters were almost ruined. Aside from that, the first 1-2 hours were kinda meh, but after that it was for some things even more engaging than Ty 2, I loved meleeing enemies and going around blasting everything and collecting with the crab mech on the roads, even if its jumps were a little unstable. I loved that the water mech, my favourite, came back even more powerful. And above all I loved that this game made the fire boomerangs relevant again, since in the second game they became kinda irrelevant and even counterproductive and I hated that.
But, even with their highlights, all the bosses [spoiler](aside from the one in the sky)[/spoiler] sucked for the first phase, in the sense that they were difficult in that phase because it was badly done for hitboxes and such, while their second phases were well done and they were objectively fun and challenging. So for what regards the full 3d games of Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, the second chapter has definitely the best bosses overall.
But this is still a very cool and interesting 3d platformer like the first two personally I don't mind the darker theme of the game, at least it didn't get the same treatment as jak 2 did. It's still a ty game. Some parts of it are good, some parts are weak. Overall this is a mixed bag for me. It may be the weakest of the trilogy, but i do recommend it to those who loved 1 and 2. And krome plz release this on consoles for those who can't afford a pc shit ahhh my child. it may have been crappy but its my crappy.",0.02070657759506682

If you don't have the time for stealth hunting, you don't know what your missing. its god ofer now!!! Rather of not of recommended the game at this time but had to choose to post.

Game is okay if you want to relax with a cup of coffee and get a little feel, just upset that you get in game, get a feel for how to play, then really can't hunt a varierty of animal that might be present in the area, becaues although you can put the free weapons with this pack on,  due to weight restrictions, you can't put in the ammo. Need certain ammo type in shotguns for different creatures, and if you add shotgun with your rifle, you wont even be able to add the pistol.. so the point of these weapons is pretty moot/meh. Pnce you get experience i guess you can get a backpack, but i think you have to pay more... 

Expect more investment and tons of cockblocks from what i can tell so they can milk in money from a cash shop done poorly..

One more tip, i didnt realize.. is you can have more than one mission... just friggan activate them all.. so stupid you even have to activate them Game is good, but the DLC does not work... FIX THIS, or give me a refund. i wouldend ask for a refund if i bought it and didnt like it, but it just simply does not work, no matter what i try wont work i am maD PAID MONEY FOR IT     GLAYMON Worst add filled game I have ever paid for and played. i bought theHunter: Wayfarer Starter Pack and i still playigng as aguest ??

The story was actually kind of cute, and surprised me. 

I especially liked the fourth wall breaks, they got a genuine giggle out of me. 

I'll be checking out CellStudios' other work! very short but decent great game. The story is excellent and the models are beautiful. Short and sweet but cheap! I like the option for body hair since the bald ones all look the same to me. Run time is probably 45 to 90 minutes, depending on how distracted you get.

If the price stays under $3 bucks then I'd say it's worth it! 7.9/10. I'd rate it higher if it were longer. Idea has potential. Unfortunatelly the game is extremely short and linear, definiely below 1h. Could be bought only with a huge discount. that's some good stuff, but i was expecting to see more of Emi, would be interesting to see how all of these stories play out much later in the timeline, like maybe the doc makes a cameo in the end of The Cabin.

enjoyable, for sure. 7.4/ 10.0 ...just the fact that it is short and less of a harem situation going on than i prefer.

 (like i already have ideas for the sequel... or extended scenes, maybe the touch of a male triggers the medication... this is to extend the story and give the explanation as to why this story unfolds like this, obviously it only imprints to one male, and in terms of extending the story, the Mega should also be in the group, yeah? i love this story, but im not sure it earned 7.5 so yeah... a 7.4 gallons of Ecchi Fun Rating) Find out where your happy ending lands - [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45229222-Inside_Outside/]Inside_Outside Curator Site[/url]

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
Adverse Effects is a RenPy visual novel.

[h1]Story[/h1]
You live with a 41 year old woman, she is working two jobs to put you through college. She's always had trouble sleeping, but now it is getting worse. You make a doctor's appointment for her and she qualifies to be part of the clinical trial for a new sleep aid drug.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
You start the game by setting the name of the main character, Desmond by default. Next you set your surname, Carter by default. Next you set the name of a woman laying on a bed, you have no idea who she is supposed to be in relationship to the main character, her name is Judith by default. Next you set your relationship to the female character, Landlady by default. Switching the two around would probably be a better idea. Next you set your relationship to the female character, Tenant by default. Next you get to set the pubic hair style of the female character, your options are none, some, and full. You are then informed that this selection only applies to this female character.

This game is strictly about the landlady and tenant. There are only a few other characters mentioned, but you only actually see one other character, the doctor.

The scenes allow you to switch positions, it will require multiple playthroughs, or reloads, to view all of the content. Most of the time you are allowed to select where you finish.

[spoiler]At the end is a ""bonus"" scene with the doctor. That doesn't really relate to the story. If you selected to impregnate the landlady, you can do the same with the doctor, but there will be no warning this time.[/spoiler]

[h1]The Gallery[/h1]
There is no Gallery, which is probably the biggest downside of this game, as you will not know if you've seen all of the content or not. You can use save game slots to bookmark any content that interest you.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
A very good game featuring a landlady and her tenant. Multiple, selectable, positions for each scene and most allow you to select where you finish. Multiple playthroughs required to see all content.

That was 4 years ago.
 More abandonware. So far: the controls are super clunky. The deck building makes almost no sense. Character movement is pointless as there is no way to keep your characters away from damage. Cards don't do what they seem to say they should, making all initial battles confusing and nearly impossible to succeed in. Mostly your characters stand around until the enemies launch 20 attacks for every one of yours and kill you. 

Really regret investing in this mess. The game is alot of fun . i really love it ..but radaghar the hordecaller seriously guysplease make him less OP

1st everyone uses him its getting extremly annoying , second its nearly inpossible to kill him when they have the skills put up that you start again 8 minions when you kill 1 another one spawns and more and more minions are coming that you cant even tough radaghar since he gest 1 armor per minion he gets.
in the last hour ive been gaming ive had lest say i did 16 battles orso 15/16 where radaghar and i could only beat one with alot of luck from the cards i got .

Like please make him less OP its just not even fun ive started to just quit match whenever its a radaghar.

for the rest the game is amazing and i love it tonnes but PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE OP RADAGHAR!

Thank This game started ok in EA, but i really disslike the store page and how everything turns into a grindfest. ""Getting your ass kicked has never been so much fun or rewarding.""

Extended review on this game. My impression is overall, very positive. I'll explain why. This review will not cover the specifics of the game itself, aside from my experiences with various aspects of it that I feel was noteworthy.

Prior Experiences and Expectations
- Paying member of Solforge, Hearthstone, Cabals TCG (dropped hundreds of bucks over the years on these. No regrets).
- Play alot of hobby board games across a wide range of genres. 
- Banner Saga: Factions. Enjoys tactics game that have a simple core design and are not RPGs. Hate RPGs actually. As little management as possible is best.
- Injustice Mobile (you'll see why this actually becomes relevent).

What drew me to Labyrinth
- Diehard need to scratch the ""miniatures wargaming"" itch. And I mean, small scale, tactical battles that is NOT JRPG, anime-ish or Warhammer. What I really wanted was the D&D miniatures wargame. Something I admired, but never played. 
- Labyrinth, visually and mechnically, resonated with this desire and need.
- Progress reports. You can tell right away that the developers are very market-oriented and open to the public at large. They keep us up to date, they respond to our questions- and they have an Early Access Game that is SOLID.

The Mechanics
-Still learning new things even though I've must have played over 10+ casual battles by now. The mechanics becomes clearer and clearer and I am astounded at how well designed it is. Initially I ignored the ticks entirely, feeling that it's extraneous, but now I am starting to pay attention once I figured out the relationship between ""how many cards I can play in a turn is dependent on whether I get moved behind another unit in tick, or I stay ahead of the enemy in ticks- which pretty much determines both initiative and resource usage."" Mindblown, I mean, technically, there is no such thing as a turn. The elegance is astounding. I love how the mechanics show you clearly what everything does- I don't find myself needing to look for additional information, through inference, I am understanding the depth of the game.
-Once you've built a Boss Deck or Two, you start grasping the underlying principles of how the Bosses work and you could then build better Heroes.
-The way they choose to present the information is very functional. The ring of health around each unit, and the TCG nature of utilizing keywords are useful. If you've played any kind of TCG/CCGs before, it's simple. And that's one of the things that set this apart. Alot of ""tactics"" games are badly disguised RPGs with alot of random chance and too MUCH STATS. Labyrinth has none of this problem. There is little to no RNG (and if there was, the cards tell you clearly), everything is clearly labeled, and you juggle with 3-4 stat types at most, with keywords. 


The Multiplayer
- Raids are addictive. You just want to keep fighting. And when you're heroes died one turn away from total victory, you feel burning vengeance but also shame because it was entirely your own fault. So far, I always lose because I made a tactical error or I suddenly realize my Hero decks wasn't appropriately geared for fighting that specific Boss strategy. This game is not easy actually, and I wouldn't want it any other way. It teaches me better tactical awareness- and the fact I am aware exactly why I lost is very humbling and makes defeats have value, rather than feeling arbitrary. If you are after winning, you won't enjoy this game as much. But if you want tactics, this game oozes with it. 
-I had thought the whole ""passive defence multiplayer"" thing might be sketchy and wouldn't draw me in (even though I play Injustice Mobile. And Dungeon Keeper Mobile, which has exactly this kind of multiplayer), just like I had assumed that the tick system wouldn't click with me (pun intended), but they actually did it pretty well. The main joy is from devising a good Boss Deck to stomp Heroes when you're offline- since multiplayer is automated for the defender. The key I think, is synergy between the Boss's passive and the deck, but each boss has a Dual Nature, so you can access deck types of other bosses, in addition to unique ones.
-So far, I have a ramp Boss (some freaky Mayan death goddess, can't spell her name) that gets stronger the more turns has passed. So her entire deck is freezing the enemy until you ramp to godhood.
-The other bossI have set up (the giantess) is a ""everytime you play a non-attack card, you deal your attack to all enemies within 3 spaces"" (paraphrase), so her entire deck is amping her base attack and drawing enemies closer. And just for kicks, I made her generate ludicrous amounts of minions as well.
-As a final note, asyncrhonous multiplayer makes it easy to drop in and drop out. No pressure. No waiting for people to take their turn. Quite casual and addictive. Like a crunchier Injustice Mobile (and we all know how addictive that is.)


The Store
-No premium currency. You get 10 gold per (casual) battle. Quests rewards 100 golds. 100 gold buys you a pack. 
-Again, like everything else, I thought I wouldn't be interested or care very much about the cards. Other CCGs have unique creatures and spells that are rich in lore and theme- those draw me in. But cards for attacks and spells for a couple of heroes and bosses? Bah? Boooring, right? BOY, Was I wrong. I actually care what cards I do get now. All cards can be crafted or disenchanted for crafting currency (forgot the name atm), so that's nice.
-Booster packs (keys) are priced nicely, and are consistently priced. Unlike other games that encourage you to buy more for more discounts, this game straight up has a 1:1 exchange rate in terms of packs per buck. This is actually really nice, as I don't have to constantly juggle with ""delaying gratification"" problems. I get 100 gold, I buy a pack right away. This isn't strictly true if you're paying money directly for the packs, as it is slighly cheaper (by about 0.32 per pack). 
-I have dropped something like $25CAD on this game. Both for the original early access price before it went F2P and for 10 packs just the night prior. Because it was worth it and I wanted to support the game. At no point did I feel that I was pressured to get ""good cards"", indeed, for a vast majority of my heroes, I feel the low-cost or basic cards are the strongest. Hearthstone feels like a grind for example. This game? Not so much. Having only 4 hero classes (so far) and multiple heroes that share those classes with overlapping cards reduces the grinding or ""I lack essential cards"" feeling that other games produces. This is a huge plus and makes collecting cards an option-expanding activity rather than a chore. 

Conclusion:
Overall, it has a minimalistic design philosophy that I really appreciate, both from the mechanics, and the economy. It fulfills a specific kind of niches for a specific type of gamer. It doesn't cheapen its brand by choosing to copy what everyone else is doing, but choosing to put thier own aesthetics and value on it. Of course, this may change as marketability changes, but for now I applaud their willingness to try something different. I look forward to what else this game has in store. Very unbalanced game. Be prepared to win 20 games you can't possibly lose and then start losing games you can't possibly win. Everything is fine and well, but when a tactical game like this says it has multiplayer mode, then I expect to figth concurrent matches against equal human opponents. However, this game only has player vs AI-controlled mode, the multiplayer content comes from other players being able to create card decks for AI to use.
It is unfortunate that this game has no true multiplayer, the system itself is good and I think it would work well. Being a player of hearthstone for almost 2 years, duelyst, chronicles, spellweaver i have to say that this game has impressed me. It is refreshing in this genre and it is very challenging. I thought fighting against other people's bosses was going to be boring because normally AI is just AI not human, but wow, great work there. I know it is still in early access but i have revised all the cards and possibilities that this game can offer and i have to say the potential is huge. Keep up the good work and I hope to see a lot of people playing this excellent game !! Lot's of great strategic mechanics that seem to fit well with the heroes and bosses. Very much like the adventure party and lair defense aspect. A gem of a game.

It's nice to find a game that expresses it's characters well through it's mechanics. Labyrinth has lots to offer the tactical gamer. Anticipation and countering are key aspects to the challenge offered, both in deck building, the progression of the battle, your heroes' turn. Heroes have specialties but you can build a balanced party nuanced how you want. Your lair defense is a fun and unique aspect, almost a game in itself. While I bought the game previously I am nonethelesss glad to see it go free to play as additional players refine the challenge. 

I had held off on my review because so much can be said about this game and I will likely add more (too busy playing it). Strategists I imagine will find this game very enjoyable and quite replayable.",0.08274975600701741

 I do not recommend this game, but I didn't dislike it enough to try and get a refund. If it weren't on offer and less than ¬£1 then I would have been upset if it was full price. If you played a lot of mediocre platformers on Kongregate to scratch that itch , you'll have some idea of what you're getting into.
   If it was just mediocre I'd understand asking for a bit of money but the glitches and actual bugs make charging for this seem cheeky, especially so at full price. One such was losing ability to jump 3/4 of the way through a level. Another was having to use the default key to jump, yet all the other mapped keys working fine, during a spaceship level.
   Things I found odd/offputting but not gamebreaking: 
     - Health is not lost at 1 heart per hit. Okay, no biggy, it's damage, sometimes you can take more harm depending on what whumped ya. But lives?! Certain insta-death collisions such as water will deduct 2 lives from you, not 1. Go figure.
    - If you jump on a ranged enemy's head to kill it *before* it's about to fire, you lose health.
    - Spike blocks that fall from the ceiling which appear to have the same graphic as a standing block will hurt you. Basically anything that could hurt you even when dormant/spent will hurt you. (Boulder finished rolling after you? The whole rock will still hurt you even after it's tucked itself in to bed)
    - Insta-dying even if you haven't fallen into a pit. If you're jumping across platforms above a pit *near* to the bottom of a stage, make sure you overcompensate and double-jump because if you go anywhere near the *border*, you'll die.

Graphics, sfx and music were good (music was great on some levels!) and was it a fun timewaster? Yeah, that's the only thing stopping me feel bitter about it being a purchase. But it really feels like a free-to-play. 
    With some play-testing, polish and bug fixes then it's sale price is perfectly acceptable. I am 32 years old.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you. This game kinda sucks. You could probably find 100 other games visually similar to this game right now that are twice as good. Super Mustache is just another generic 8-bit indie platformer that I think you would be better off skipping. ‚£ø‚£ø‚°ª‚†ø‚£≥‚†∏‚¢ø‚°á‚¢á‚£ø‚°ß‚¢π‚†ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£æ‚£ø‚°á‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚°ø‚°ê‚£Ø‚†Å ‚†Ñ‚†Ñ

Run, jump, smash, &amp; slice your way through 55+ weird &amp; different levels, with giant monsters, swarming missiles &amp; secret areas.","Twice the joy! I loved the first game. Groove City was fine. This one has some cool ideas and overall is very enjoyable experience. I still do not understand how the base of this game which includes most of the levels is FREE. I hope we will see ESJ 3 one day. I bought both ""DLCs"", since I want to support the developers and in my opinion, the content is worth it. It's amazing, go check it out! :) I purchased the deluxe because I remembered the first ESJ being quite fun. This is like that, but with more abilities - very hard platforming and a solid soundtrack. ebin Hard & fun platformer, innovative new gameplay elements, but overall the first ESJ is better. Incredible platformer with lot of different mechanics and nice OST. 
The story is still as crazy as the first one, and on the top of that the game is f2p (which imo is a complet steal) Well, if you played the previous games and thought there would be improvements on this one, you'll be rather disappointed...

First off, level design tends to be is really poor. It doesn't feel you're progressing as you clear levels. Layouts are not so inspired or clever, though there are exceptions. It is really easy to get yourself killed by getting out of camera range and so on. Furthermore, constant sidescrolling segments and tons of enemies that shoot homing missiles give a sense that this game is about luck, not skill.

FPS levels are horrible. Seriously, they're near unplayable if you play with a joystick.

Graphics are ok. I think they fit really well with the theme. The only problem is that sometimes it is not clear if enemies can be stomped or not. Also, in some levels, the amount of glowing, moving stuff in the background makes the level harder than it should be. 

The level selection screen is confusing as hell. Whoever designed that must have failed all HCI exams...

There are some minor things that the programmer didn't pay attention such as not showing time/death the first time you open the level selection screen or showing power ups that you already have when respawning.

Soundtrack is excelent and basically the selling point. 

Now, to be fair, it's a free game. Despite many things that suggest the game was rushed, the soundtrack is awesome and can be entertaining if you're already familiar with hardcore platformers. If you never played Electronic Super Joy before, start with 1 instead of 2. Perfect sequel to a great game. I have no idea why it is free though! To start,I don't actually like this game, it feels like smashing your head against a brick wall hoping to break it down. I can't even get past the forth level. But that doesn't matter because the game is free. The reason this gets a recommendation is because the OST is fantastic. It's worth playing just to hear the soundtrack. When playing in puplic it is recommended to mute checkpoint sounds üíÄüíÄ

Really good platformer with hours of playtime for free.

434050,Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour,game,False,"11 Oct, 2016","Action, Adventure","Frag like it‚Äôs 1996 ‚Äì this time with even more asses to kick! Join the world‚Äôs greatest action hero in Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour as he saves Earth once again, kicking alien ass and saving babes across the globe along the way.","good shooter game The 20th Anniversary version is the best looking Duke Nukem remaster in my opinion, with true 3D rendering, you notice it when you look up and down. However, the actual feel to the game has been ruined. The game's mouse look has a deadzone where fine adjustment is close to impossible. Everything you do seems to have an input delay, this is very noticeable in the game's movement, where running, stopping, or changing directions make you feel like you're walking on ice. Queueing weapon swaps are really janky, sometimes having you swap to the previous weapon instead of the weapon you actually want.  The whole experience is just not very responsive. If you plan to buy it, try eduke instead. I only recently started to play this franchise, and luckily somehow I got the Megaton version back in the days. But the 20th Anniversary version is the latest version isn't? So I played the Anniversary version for a few levels, and decided to go back and play Megaton version for reasons I myself don't really know. It could be because of the weird rewind feature (which is from the Xbox Live Arcade version which is also what the Anniversary version based on) or some other things just made me feels weird.

I finished the entirety of Megaton version + expansion packs without much issues besides some minor sound effect glitches  from time to time, and how the NVG works kinda bad. Then I played the fan made source port for N64 which I really like, the fan made source port includes a lot of QoL features which are pretty enjoyable. 

Then I came back to this to play Alien World Order and... it's just the worst. I had high hope for this actually, especially the flamethrower which is something I really like, it's a shame it wasn't featured in the final version of Duke Nukem 3D. 

So when I was playing the few levels in the first episode it was fine actually. i don't really mind the new 3D graphics (the ambient occlusion feels kinda weird though), I personally don't have the control issues as some others mentioned, though I do have issue with vertical mouse aiming as if there is some vertical acceleration turned on which are not shown in the option menu, but it's not thaaat bad. Also I didn't turned the developer commentary on when I was playing the first episode so I have no idea what they were saying in there. But I did turn it on for Alien World Order.

While most of these are going to be about Alien World Order, some of these issues are also in Anniversary version in general:

Pros:

1. It has the flamethrower, and it works quite well against regular enemies

2. New soundtrack isn't bad

Cons:

1. Firefly troopers shrink themselves and when they did that it is very difficult to hit them (if you can hit them at all). I don't think I ever killed one of those shrinked firefly trooper with hitscan weapons ever, it just feel kinda frustrating and drag the combat when some of them just refuse to come back to normal (or shrinked themselves again very quickly) and if you don't want to waste your explosive, you just have to stand there and wait for them.

2. Your flamethrower doesn't work underwater, but I think firefly trooper's does? One of them once splitting flame at me when we were both in the water and that damaged me, it just didn't lit me on fire I think.

3. The flamethrower doesn't show up in your ""0"" weapon slot if you picked it up using full HUD and it caused me some confusion when I was wondering where is my flamethrower went, and because of this you cannot keep track of your ammo for the flamethrower by looking at the full HUD.

4. These new levels in Alien World Order are... well I don't want to question Allen Blum's and Richard Gray's level design abilities, I know they were part of the original dev team and are experienced professional, but for some reasons they just really really love to spam alien hordes for you to fight in this new episode. I never feels this game on ""Come Get Some"" is that hard. But with so many enemies in a very high density, it just made combat a frustrating chore to get through. The bosses are made thing worse. I always feels bosses in this game are ""strafe and hold down LMB at them for awhile"" or ""find a blind spot and hold down LMB for awhile"" and since how they love to spawn them plus the mini version you have to do that a lot, and it gets old really fast. Many of those levels' layouts don't help it either as most of them are not really in boss arena (there are only like a couple of actual boss arena iirc), you can easily find a blind spot or stay far away and just ""hold down LMB at them for awhile"". And Yes I know such boss and enemy placement were in the original episodes as well but not this frequent and overused to the point it making me feels like I'm playing some troll mods.

5. The developer commentary on Alien World Order are... not very informative, 95% of the comments are like Allen Blum and Richard Gray saying whatever off the top of their head as they were playing the game. They probably talk more about their old maps though, I haven't listen to those yet so I can't be sure.

6. Bugs. lot of weird bugs. 

6.1 First thing I noticed is how pressing ESC will play a random sound effects for no apparent reason, these sounds consists of shooting, exploding, reloading, gibbing and Duke's moaning sounds etc. It confused me and made me thought as if I bind some weird functions to the ESC key but after checking and reset the key bindings several times it persists.

6.2 It is hard to use the keycard on the card slot. From what I heard it is because of interaction is now part of auto aiming now and it also effect pressing buttons. This caused me some confusion when I was playing L.A. Meltdown as I thought i didn't get the keycard and wasted some of my time to look for a keycard I already picked up. 

(Now I remember one of the reasons why I stopped playing Anniversary version was I cannot trigger a secret switch, I didn't know why back then so I just got frustrated and stopped and go back to Megaton version.)

6.3 The Rewind feature will randomly decided ""you are died"" for no reason. It's a minor annoyance compare to many other stuff but still it's a straw to the camel's back. It can be fixed easily by turning this feature off.

6.4 Sound effects missing or glitching, and it is so much worse than the Megaton version's sounds glitching. Drinking tap water has no sound at all. And some times a door make no sounds when open or from a misaligned source (No it was not a secret door), or the worst case, make horribly loud overlapping sounds that will tear your ears. I got jumpscared by one of these doors sound once and it became one of the major reason why I'm writing this negative review.

6.5 There are some vertical surface, like a very tall wall or cliff, if you move into it Duke will instantly flew onto the top of it as if it's a small step.

6.6 Bosses and mini bosses which the new episode really adores will turn invincible if they took too much damage from flamethrower damage.

Most importantly from what I heard many of these issues exist since day one, that means Gearbox has completely abandoned (or never really cared about) this game as they haven't fixed any of these in the past nine years.

7. The NVG still just barely works. 10/10 one of the best shooters and best games of all time. Sad that it doesn't include the official addons..oh well. 
 Hail to the king baby! YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

COME GET SUM!!!!! This version is okay Glad I finally got to play a Duke nukem game and it being this instead of forever. 

It‚Äôs tons of fun with the overtop action film parodies and ‚Äúwtf‚Äù humor and moments. I understand why people love Duke and want him to come back. 

Play it now to understand and love Duke and his crazy adventures now over forever! Rad! I would rather play this than Doom. I got his just for the nostalgia but ended up wanting to find everything. The old cheats do not work but typing GOD for god mode during gameplay still works. I suggest doing that while finding all the secrets and then going back without cheating to try to get a good time, or using a guide the first time because the amount of secrets I never knew existed and never would found, like never in a million years lol. The mod maps in the workshop are awesome also! No one is online but there might be a discord you can find people in. Get it if it's on sale.

604510,Empires in Ruins,game,False,"25 Mar, 2021","Indie, RPG, Simulation, Strategy","The bastard child of Grand Strategy and Tower Defense, with a black humor infused plot, set in a grim, disillusioned world. Quell the rebellion, tame the Western Marches, disobey your orders and save your brandy. Not strictly in this order.","Fun game, interesting writing with sometimes rather juvenile humor - I quite liked it. The tower defense part is solid, the resource management was sometimes tedious but not too bad. I had lots of fun until the end! I tried to play the game after leaving it for a while, it has some interesting aspects, but overall it is lackluster.  It seems that not much thought went into the UI and the game isn't good enough to make up for this.  To give an example, when you click to get to your research, it has to go to a loading screen and then you have to ""Press a key to continue"".  Why do I need to press a key to continue to just get to the research screen?  Just load the damn screen!! the only good thing about this bugged crap is that with its 0 graphics, it does not take a lot of time to reload after it crashes Very underrated TD game. Cool mechanics of towers and enemies you don't see around in other games. The grand strategy part of the game is good and not too overwhelming to get the hang of. Solid game, underrated af, but solid. Pretty boring game.  Lame for a TD, lame for a city manager, 'grand' is far too grand a word for this game.  
BUT BUT BUT
It's cheap, get it.  Better to have choices than not enough games.  Support developers. I wish I could give a separate thumbs up and thumbs down for the two parts of this game. The strategic province management side of things is well-written, has great art, and reasonably engaging gameplay. The tower defence side had much worse art and much less impressive gameplay that didn't really innovate on a genre that has way too many samey entries. Auto-resolving the tactical battles to avoid the boring tower defence generally resulted in my guys getting massacred, so I had to slop my way through them instead. Until I realized I wasn't having fun and just ended things. 

I wish I could recommend. The strategic level is really very innovative. It's just too bad it was yoked to underwhelming tower defence combat. Swap out the existing TD combat for something else, and you'd have a Total War style contender. A Yes to recommend this title in an overdue review, long after I gave up playing. The developer put forth a fine effort, but the design seems flawed in a way that doesn't seem surmountable - your towers can be destroyed. There are two ways in which you cannot keep up with this mechanic. 1. You physically cannot keep up with the demands of the action in later difficult missions. 2. You cannot keep up from a Resource standpoint as all your structures get damaged or obliterated while you simultaneously must build direly needed additional structures. All over.

The story and dialogue is excellent. Refreshing in an online sea of generic characters and homogenous speech. A Risk-style strategic map allows you to set the stage for the defenses you mount as well as the offensives you instigate to take more provinces for additional resources. There are persistent upgrades that unlock new assets and that apply subtle statistical boosts to those assets. But the re-building mechanic - when such is most critical - becomes insurmountable far into the game.

I had 2 paths to my castle - one from the West, one from the East. I could hold the paths, but get bombed into dust by enemy airships. Establish enough air defenses to thwart the airships, and the enemy overruns you on the ground. Fortify the West approach and defend against air, and the Eastern approach steamrollers you. Invest in early resource generation (on the battlemap) and you don't have enough early defenses to survive to benefit from them. Lots of interesting elements to play with, such as stationable troops on the actual pathways, but not much opportunity to play with them. Not at that point, in those difficult circumstances.

A great game which I had to decide I had gotten as far as I could in. A good developer who deserves attention, and who hopefully brings out more titles such as this in the future. 3/10

This game is TD+Global map strategy ( civilization, krusaders kings and etc)...but les detailed and userfriendly

Why i dislike this game:
1) Bribe for your warlords... is most anoying thing in game.,.you will hate it alot...if only there a button bribe all....but there is not button like this
2) Humor ....i thout it will be dark humor but it is complex of poo jokes and curses...nothing more 
3) Level of happiness....dear devs hope you never repeat it again...i spend 1 h with zero tax level and zero fist level...but it is not improved from 39 to 40...looks like it is almost impossible to compleate company by lidership....800+ deays and company is not finished...im done for this game
 Interesing tower defense that blends with grand strategy. It nots easy to mix genres, and this game certainly has its flaws, but it nails it enough. 
Gameplay wise. its kinda interesing tower defense because your tower needs to be built by worker that walks from the base and both towers and worker can be attacked an destroyed, a few replays may be needed to beat certain maps.
 The game is hard (if you decide to play the maps) and there are maps that feel a bit unfair, and maybe they are (looking at you, explosive fliying enemies). In certain sense it kinda helps the funny and colorful narrative of someone that has to do a shitty work. Towers have their skills, some are useful, some questionable, but you will use a tower at least once for certain enemies.
Enemies arent that varied as other tower defenses like Kingdom Rush, but they certainly represent a challenge once they start to appear more often in mixed groups and you dont have a good tower to fend them. You will end up hate them and celebreate when you take out all of em.

The grandstrategy part is nice, but it requires some polish, like selecting every mayor manually or every time its a new recruit or the lack of fast and simpel info from were you already sent reinforcements. This section is also a bit hard in diffuclty, because you need a decent mayor in certain towns to produce material wich you will need eventually. 

Storywise, wich is like half of the fun, its pretty much a unglorious story of political plot using other factions and how you are traped in this mess , wich you hate and dint want, but its your work. The character are fun to read, they have their quirks, the jokes are well made and you will probably save some responses to use in your work. The story will probably remind you of your time were you had to do some work/service/internisph that really sucks and hated but you had to do it anyway and the only thing helping your sanity was alcohol and black humor.

Overall, not a perfect game, but one that is fun enough and has quirky characters and some ""nostalgia"" for those who hated/hate their job. [h1]Funny and... Nothing Else[/h1]

This game's dialogues are hilarious and made me laugh out loud several times, which is very rare. But everything else about it is so-so at best.


[u][b]The not-so-good:[/b][/u]
- 9.7 hours were enough for me to beat the Campaign on Hardcore and the Sandbox mode once. After that, there isn't any real reason to play more. You can make a few different choices in the Campaign, to see how things turn out, but... why bother?

- The 4x facet of the game is nothing special. You build one structure after another, in towns, upgrade these, get more resources, more bonuses to attacking other territories, reduce rioting chances and that's it. You don't need to make specialized towns or anything of the sort, there is no need to put much thought into it;

- The Tower Defense aspect of the game, which should be its strongest suit, turns out to be pointless. You can automatically resolve every battle (other than the Campaign's final one) and doing so tends to yield much better results than playing it manually. You can automatically get a 3 star outcome (requires no damage whatsoever to your HQ) on a battle that you previously attempted manually, tried your best and got defeated in. So, you simply don't play the combat. [i]Ever.[/i] Which leaves you with a 4x-only game;

- If you decide to do battle manually, despite having no actual reason to do so, you'll find it rather annoying. There are some debris scattered over all maps, stopping you from building towers on some of the most logical places. What is really irritating, though, is that you need to send workers out to build and repair towers. When they go out, if they cross paths with enemies, they die. At the same time, some foes can [i]very[/i] easily damage and destroy your towers, and repairing them costs quite a lot. After a few waves, most of your resources are spent on repairs rather than on building or upgrading your towers, sending you into a downwards spiral as waves keep becoming harder. You also need to send in wave after wave, as fast as possible, to get extra gold, so enemies keep coming while you keep frequently trying to repair several towers at the same time. It's quite unpleasant;

- There's a fairly extensive research tree in the game, but all of it is combat-focused. Since you simply automatically resolve every battle, the whole research aspect of the game becomes useless. I don't even think having more techs unlocked influence in auto-solved battles, at all;

- There's this mechanic, Tributes, in Empires in Ruins. Every 30 or so turns, you have to pay a large amount of resources to the Crown. If you fail to do so 5 times, you lose the game. It's annoying, but at least it gives you some [rather useless] bonuses when you pay it off. You can turn Tributes off before starting a game and, if you do so, everything becomes ridiculously easy -- the Tributes are basically the [i]only[/i] thing that provides a little bit of a challenge (the combat might but, again, there's no point in fighting manually);


[u][b]TL;DR:[/b][/u]
Empire in Ruins' dialogues are hysterical -- it's potty-mouth sarcasm at its finest. It sounds cheesy but, honestly, it's funny as hell. The gameplay itself, on the other hand, is rather generic, bland, unbalanced and easy.

2201930,Oriental Valley,game,False,"25 Apr, 2024","Adventure, Casual, Indie, RPG, Simulation","Welcome to the weird and wonderful world where modern country life meets quirky simulation adventure! Here you'll immerse yourself in a laid-back lifestyle full of traditional customs, make a bunch of quirky new friends, and embark on bizarre adventures.","It is a delightful game, but it is incomplete. I bought this on sale, despite negative reviews on YouTube.

The English translation is bad and there are bugs, but I'm still smitten with its goofy style. I'm always unlocking things by surprise, and for the weirdest reasons, and they keep throwing more and more on my plate that I can do or work towards. 

People don't seem to enjoy the humor in it, but it is very Chinese ""nonsense comedy"" a la Stephen Chow. If you've played ""Song of the Prairie,"" it is similar in its absurdism, but Oriental Valley doesn't have quite as many head scratching moments.   Oriental Valley makes sense, even if just barely.

Pros: 
Weird and quirky with lots of at least somewhat unique systems that are introduced, often by surprise.

Nice graphics, even if they are Unity assets or whatever--it's a pretty game! 

Runs fairly well on the Steam Deck--some of the menus go off the screen, but I've been 
playing it entirely on the Steam Deck. It loads fast!

Being kind of janky, there are exploits where you can make more money than maybe the developer intended--to me that's quite satisfying.

Cons: You do need patience, and it is likely helpful to go in with the expectation that this won't be a refined experience. 

Some things you can only do on certain days which leaves you without much to do during the in-game week after you get to a certain point.

Some things aren't translated at all which makes it very difficult nearer the end. 

All in all I'm on the fence with this one. I'd suggest a purchase if on sale and you know what you're getting into. What are you getting into exactly? A fun, goofy, flawed game. One that I'm playing but don't know if at a certain point I'll have to leave it incomplete because I don't speak Chinese. I really enjoy this game way more than I expected. It's such a hilariously fun parody of normal farming sims.

Instead of playing someone trying to get away from the big city to live a peaceful farming life, you're playing someone desperately trying to get out. It really feels like you're this random college student trapped in this weird fairy land full of bizarre oddities and you're trying to survive long enough to go home.

It sounds weird, it plays even weirder, but it has a really fun, strange charm of its own!

Plus, you have a combat system, the world's most hilarious mining quest, a really fun series of quests to collect what's basically pokemon, a lot of really cool areas to open up and explore (with little side quests of their own), and some surprisingly decent farming action.

If you like farming games and want a twist on an old formula in a game that will probably take you about 30 hours max to fully complete, I would recommend this game (especially when it's on a good sale like its on now). I'm so disappointed. I was really looking forward to this game. 
The blank NPCs are definitely odd. I could have forgiven that but... You'd think that with all the time they saved not bothering to design those NPCs at all, they could have put that effort into the main NPCs. It doesn't feel like they did, though. One of my first interactions with the village chef is just him saying ""I'm a chef!"". The next day, he wouldn't speak to me, and I read a dialogue about him grumbling and staring off into space. Riveting stuff. 

Also, you'd think that the blank NPCs aren't important because they didn't bother to design them, but they have gifted me things and given me quests, sometimes with or without any indication that something meaningful would happen if I spoke to them. I found this out because I went around speaking to all the blank NPCs because I was so bored with the rest of the game. 

I know that I didn't play for that long. Maybe it gets better? Very cute farm sim graphics are great, a few translations are not fully complete but still manageable only noticed it in one quest line. Thankfully the things you needed to complete it are still translated. Not for everyone this game does have only a few actual npcs and the rest are stick men. Which is a design choice I find charming but others hate. 
The difficulty curve isn't too bad only issue is earning money really takes time the further you progress in the game.

*tip for easy money* 
If you are struggling to earn money a quick way I did alot of early game fundings was mining the red stone in levels 20-28 they sell for 200 each so it's not bad. You do have to unlock some upgrades but since you can get food from chests it's a fairly painless grind.
Overall I enjoy it unlocking new areas and the random events that occur during the month is fun.

* TLDR Overall Rating*
8/10 graphics
7/10 gameplay
6/10 translations
10/10 weird/funny scale I really enjoy this game and find it relaxing. avid farm/life sim gamer here i buy and play most games like this one and this one just isnt doing it for me. games like this are sposed to make me look up and notice ive wasted an entire day. this one i found myself losing interest quickly. no way to pin tasks to ur hud so u can easly forget what ur sposed to be doing. the farming is ehhhh  u very quickly dont need ur hoe anymore as u get a a frog u can kick across the field to plow for u. i would have like a strafing button to make watering / planting better as u can easly step forward to much and hit the wrong farm plot. as another guy pointed out the title would make u think ud be focus on chinese or other asian crops more but no just standard western crops u can plant rice in a paddy but that aspect feels so half assed cant even nicly line the rice up u just throw them . everythign from wat to do to how to advance feels kinda directionless u pretty much just have to do everything u can to advance the town . most the town town is made up of souless white maniquins and well i personaly wouldnt care as much if it was just that but the like 10 non white npcs are bout as souless as the rest of them no ones moves around everybody just stays were u find them for the most part. didnt even get past first month so i cant say wat comes next but even the months and seasons are weird the first month ur there calender at top just says this month. fishings just boring not rlly a mini game liek most others u just wait for a bite and keep clicking till u reel it in 
just a shame as soon as i saw this one on steam i wishlisted it hoping for well a lot bettre then this . this almost feels like a quik pump out a bare bones cash grab game This game is fun, but has a lot of issues. It isn't fully translated, some quests ask for one thing but actually require another (a fishing quest asks for chubs but actually means bighead carp), and certain things to progress really aren't clear (if you access the area with apple trees before unlocking the bamboo sea, there are no clues on how to get a broom. Turns out, you gotta unlock the bamboo sea path, and right before departure you get the broom in a vending machine after talking to the train lady. Also, to catch fish with your hands in certain places like the mudflats, you have to gift a character a star from the firefly place that I cant remember the name of).

Pros
-I really like the fishing and how there aren't any skill checks or annoying mini games for it
-The cooking is easy. You can read the recipe book and figure out the ingredients very easily based on shape alone, so unlocking new recipes is a breeze. I also like the function of making x1, x5, and x10 when in the recipe menu
-Farming is simple, as always. How the ground, plant seeds, water them, harvest. There is an agrispirit who can get the plots ready for you so you don't have to do it one by one which is nice.
-Quests are pretty easy to complete (when given the right instructions)
-You can get pretty cute outfits
-The companions are really cool. I want to collect them all
-There is a lot to explore! I have played about 12 hours and still have three locations to unlock, I believe
-The game is indeed pretty
-It is so easy to get engrossed and spend numerous hours at a time playing

Cons
-Fishing quest asks for chubs when it really means bighead carp
-It isn't fully translated. There is one NPC with little chicks in it in the back corner of the logging location, and the only English word in it is BEEF so I have no clue what to do
-Placing seeds and watering is a little annoying because it isn't the easiest to lock on to the spots
-You lose time searching for items (like a broom) when it is tied to a quest with no indication of it
-The harvest competition thing should have had a tutorial mode like it offers for the card game and farming, as it is very confusing to me (I failed miserably)
-The storage spots in the wagon to sell things is not enough. I fill it  a lot and it gets frustrating not being able to sell everything in one day
-Uses for some things is not clear, like the timid tomato and other vegetables similar
-The character design does feel a bit lazy since so many NPCs are just blank models

Overall I do think it needed more work before being released, but that wont stop me from playing. chaotic & weird farming game, quirky in a charming kind of way.
 super fun, like surprisingly fun I gave this game a chance and played it for 3 hours to see if it would get better, but it's just not enjoyable.
The graphics may look good at first glance, but most characters are simply blank mannequins with no unique features and they always say the same thing. 
The dialogues don't make sense at all, nor does the story. The farming is functional but very barebones, with no unique mechanics. Most of the game consists of fetch quests, but gathering resources feels extremely clunky or doesn't make sense, for example you need a broom in order to get apples from trees (?) and the game doesn't tell you where to get the broom and no shop seems to be selling it. There are so many amazing farming games available, I can't find any reason to recommend this game over another.

I have a Ryzen 9 and it was running at 10 frames per second...
You can tell these game assets were not designed to be scaled up so much, so it's likely stock Unity game assets cobbled together with no optimisation techniques.
The girls are constantly in bikini and don't actually move. They stand there and do the same stomping animation (which can hit you even if you're far away from it.
Every time you get hit, you get sent back to the ""girl selection"" area (????) and have to spend the next 20 seconds running back to the middle of the island so you can be stepped on again. (You're also locked to first person, so you can't see anything)

There are no settings. You can't change the resolution, graphics settings, audio volume, difficulty, and neither can it decide on a control scheme. Sometimes you have to use the space bar to do something, then other things you have to press ""E"".

All you need to know is there's an achievement for playing for 10 minutes. And only 30% of players have gotten it.

Yeah this is so unfinished that it's not even a game. Its a template with Unity presets in it, likely with scripts written by an AI. I may have spent more time writing this review than PaulArts spent making this ""game"". No 3rd person view and you dead even when they do not even touch you. This game has POTENTIAL i would love to see added attacks, humiliation moves using different body parts, maybe even death scenes, im tired of some ecchi games that get so much story you just want to get to the fighting, o a way to fight back even if its futile or just to stun would be nice, it sucks you start to far away from the girls most of your time will be used walking close to them at first, im not sure if this game will continue but it definitely has potential. matrepipece Pretty basic game without any bells or whistles.  Good for a few minutes of laughs dodging giant girls, but not much point to playing more than that. 

Would be a lot more engaging if you could work up to different types of outfits and footwear for the girls as that would create a lot more variety.  At present the only play value is a huge number of points for the final achievement, but that's not a reason to play...not to mention you can only earn 3 points a dodge since there aren't anything like multipliers or other things you can invest points in to make the score go up faster.

Will give a thumbs up as it was a good laugh dodging giant girls for a few minutes as opposed to dodging bullets or other more normal game gimmicks.

Walk the land, sail the seas, fly through the sky! It's a sex-seeking, world-traversing RPG!","I have NO IDEA why the sequel is not available on Steam.
This game's sequel is basically one of the reasons why I had to make a GoG account.

This is a GREAT Adult themed JRPG meant FOR ADULTS.
I even like the straightforward protagonist. Though, after seeing the events of the first dungeon, there were hints of how you can choose how to morally guide the protagonist in his... pursuits...

Not a fan of being forced to use a mouse or a keyboard to play this though. The only way I was going to give this a thumbs up was if the game gave me a decision to kill ""Mother Eve"" at the end of the game. You figure out pretty early on that she's a massive sphincter because she classifies fornication at the same level as murder and curses anyone who fornicates with a curse that doesn't allow them to mine, cook, raise animals, grow crops, or do anything else useful. Yes, this curse also applies to victims of rape. If you're cursed by Eve, your only options to survive are charity or theft. 

The H scenes of this game are F-tier. I didn't get hard once. The artists struggled to get basic human anatomy correct. Also, the MC is second-only to Eve herself in terms of insufferability. The writers are clearly shut-ins because their idea of rizz is to have Mr. MC walk up to a woman and say ""ME WANT SEX. ME WANT SEE UR BOOBZ."" And, of course, since all the women in this world are stilted sex robots, this somehow makes them swoon. Seriously, don't try this irl, you'll be hit with a restraining order.

What kept me playing was the Snakecrest conspiracy and the Evenicle mystery. Both plots ended up being a letdown. The revelations about Eve didn't change my opinion about her other than to make me hate her more for being a tyrant and a hypocrite. The revelations about the first ancestor were okay but they weren't worth all the H scenes I had to skip through.

All-in-all, there's too little story here to justify someone else purchasing this and there are a million more sexy games than this on the market. Give it a miss.

Finally, here's a list of additional things that annoyed me to drive home how awful this game is:
-Buddy canonically likes to chug piss.
-This game includes a scene where a child zombie sexually assaults her own dying father and then eats him. (get therapy if this is your fetish)
-This game includes a sex scene with a freshly dead corpse
-Mr. MC rapes a defeated enemy (he avoids Eve's curse because Eve's rules have been temporarily rescinded) which goes to show he has no principles and only follows laws when expedient. 
-Mr. MC dares to ask the question of if it's still gay to have sex with a man if you give him tits and replace his penis with a vagina (spoiler: yes, it's still gay.)
-Tio gave up her career as President to quite literally become a mommy bang maid. Calling all polygamists! Alicesoft's Evenicle may very well become your saving grace; The game certainly saved me. Evenicle is 60 hours of pure fun, packed with amusing, lovable characters, great side quests, one of the coolest fantasy maps I've seen, and plenty of unique enemies and gal monsters to find. Our goat, Aster, takes upon the daunting task of having multiple wives via a convenient law made along with the world...and so he fulfills his quest. Each wife is a joy to be around, and it shows. I've never seen a man who loves women more. Partially because of this, I could sit behind the screen for days on end playing Evenicle. It really is addicting.

Alicesoft is known for their gameplay, and I love Evenicle's gameplay. An improved version of Rance Quest gameplay, many people would call it too simple or easy, but who cares? It fits Evenicle perfectly, which wasn't supposed to be difficult like some games in the Rance Series. It's enjoyable, smooth and clean, and most importantly well balanced. It is very hard to miss things in the game, and I really love that. You won't get locked out of a CG, or miss an item, or any bullshit that happens with other Alicesoft games. A lot of love was put into Evenicle back in the day.

The story is...good? What? Yeah, the story is good. Its woefully entertaining with some of the most hilarious things I've seen in fiction. Funny H-scenes that will leave you rolling. Just pure laughs and fun that the whole family can enjoy. (maybe not) And while I would say this is a more lighthearted, adventurous Alicesoft game, veteran fans can expect to get ALL of the classic Alicesoft flair...who doesn't love a bit of Ham Bambaras running a train? Monster birth via haughty woman? They know just what to include. Of course, the 3D models, backgrounds and map are stunning and perfect for the game. Eroge never felt this good. The music? Some of the catchiest out there, I listen to it regularly. Evenicle is worth playing and I would totally play it again. No, annoying visual novel BS, didn't even make it to the H scenes.... game is expensive but the gameplay and art style are very good would like a sub just because its hard to read and look while im hard but other than that its a great game

I give this game 5 out of 10 stars. If it were possible. I got it on sale its very good otherwise. Kinda like Space crusade space hulk and needs improvement. But its getting better. The missions are random and generated and so are the maps so no one game is the same. Pretty much.

I'll give a better rating later after its progressed. Didn't like the graphics but thought the game design and mechanics might be good. 
Well they weren't. 









 Big improvements from the first game. I enjoy controlling more than four marines and the new skill system gives each run more variance. The portraits you can assign to your marines are gorgeous and makes you more invested in them not dying. After a few hours of play I experienced one bug but it was minor involving a marines action points not displaying correctly after I started on a new planet and it was fixed after switching to another marine and back again.

There is a weird mechanic where opening doors has certain effects depending on the class of the marine that opened it. I think it's weird and not realistic but I found myself spending more time thinking about exactly hiw I wanted to move my team. This doesn't appeal to me that much but you can ignore it if you want all the door stuff is only beneficial to you.

The easy difficulty option is imo a lot easier than the easy difficulty from the first game. If you're not a beginner to tactics games I recommend starting a bit higher up.

Eager to see where this game goes in early access. This is still Early. I think The Guy not playing Steam Marines 1 will not be satisfied for Game Volume of current version on this price , I mean 25$ around. But you know , This is Early and Steam Marines is one of most success case of Early access and I was playeding Steam Marines 1 , So , I'm really exciting for this game and knowing What This game Aiming to. So I think , We must remind , What ""Early Access"" meaning. and you know I just really thrilling about if someone forget that. I'm happy to pay 25$ for this real countable game! But You guys must remember before buying this game , This is Early Access. And you must remember True Early Access meaning! you know. but this game will be great! I proud own this game in this moment, I meaning time and space! you know Really fun game with a lot of character customization, multiple classes with unique abilities/upgrade paths, and lots of different possible playstyles. I've played mostly on some of the lower difficulty levels, which probably allowed me to progress further than I would have otherwise thanks to permadeath. On lower difficulty, you can freely explore and blow up aliens and robots at your leisure, while learning the game mechanics and picking up tips that will save your bacon when you ramp up the difficulty (Oh, you used your last action point to move around a corner and ran into a Ripsaw? RIP. Hopefully your replacement marine will have learned from its predecessor).

Particularly enjoyed some of the features that I haven't really seen before in other games, notably, a unique class effect that grants different benefits upon breaching entryways, which gives a lot of additional complexity and strategic possibilities, and the randomized (and often hilarious) effect at the beginning of each turn which can give a much-needed boost, or wreck the delicate planning you had in place. 

The procedural generation yields lots of replayability (and some very odd/unique map layouts), and I'm looking forward to what the polished final project looks like, give it a shot, and leave some feedback for the dev!",0.11060256583694074

ÊàäÂØÖÂπ¥Áßã‰∫é‰π¶Êàø Dungeons of Betrayal takes you through dark, puzzle-filled dungeons with a story full of twists and decisions. You‚Äôll encounter characters who might betray you, adding to the tension as you explore. The game offers a classic RPG experience with weapon upgrades, stat management, and hidden areas to discover. It‚Äôs got a simple charm, but the unpredictable nature of who you can trust keeps it interesting. If you enjoy dungeon crawlers and decision-heavy gameplay, this one's worth checking out for its replayability and mystery. This game is strange. Structurally, it's sound, and very polished. It's fast-paced, and clearly, the developer cared a lot about making this a good game. There are SOME original assets. Not a lot, but there are some. The character portraits and battle backgrounds are original. My question is, if they're willing to do that much, why still include the basic default RPG Maker assets at all? Why not make everything from the ground up? That seems like a very strange decision to me. The gameplay is fun but it can get repetitive, and there's really not much else going on besides grinding and getting to the next level. That's fine, it's just not really my type of thing. It's a decent game, and I think it's quite decent, but it just doesn't go all the way in my opinion. Also the game is incredibly easy. Way too easy. 

6/10. It's a good game, but I don't really see myself coming back to it I am 32 years old.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

820460,Hero Academy 2,game,False,"29 May, 2018",Strategy,"Sequel to the original tactical strategy game, Hero Academy 2 adds card collection, deck building, and real-time matches!","Was taken out of early access and stated as final so they could abandon the game.
For a pvp based f2p game, that has in game purchases and zero support updates or content updates from the developer after going ""Final"".

Can't and won't reccomend this game to anyone.
Nor would i advise anyone ever give Robot entertainment any money for any of their new games if there are ever any untill they have been final are still supported after being moved out of Early access. This is my first steam game review and I thought it was neccessary for this game.  For a seemingly simple strategy board game this game packs a lot of punch.  

Firstly the pros: 
-Game looks beautiful, graphics are great and the effects look really great!
-Cross platform: Play on PC, Phone, tablet all under the same account..I love this! (Phone and tablet version free, PC version costs money but gives you way more value in terms of unlocking cards etc...worth it!)
-Strategy!!!! I love this game because of the hundreds of decks you can build.  The more you play the more strategies you uncover which is something that I love!
-Overall, great game and I highly recommend for beginners to deck building games and for experienced players.

Cons:
-Rewards system could be better...It takes quite some time to unlock legendary cards. I wish there were more ways to earn rewards apart from just dueling (after you beat the campaign) and waiting ever 4hours for a chest. It'd be better if it was similar to clash royale for this.
-Explanation of cards. I wish cards had a bit more of an explanation. Every once and a while you learn a new dynamic of how two cards work together. (The campaign helps for the basics and some) but every once and a while I learn that two cards don't work together....takes a while to get the hang of it....part of playing and learning i guess...not too big a deal!

Overall, I highly recommend this...since buying it I have loved customizing decks to make a perfect deck...Highly recommend...one that will be a perfect game for short sprints or long hauls. It's a good game, slighty diferent from the first but fun too. I hope they'll put the formers teams; the dwarf, the tribe, team fortress... I love turn based tactical games. Latesly Ive played everything from duelyst, to Tactical monsters, hearthstone and a bunch of others. I like this new hero academy the most. The graphics are great. I can play on my phone or on steam, both interlinked. Lots of cards. Never crashes. Lots of single player campaign stuff to do.

GET THIS GAME if you love turn based tactical. The game has 3 unique races and a plethora of neutral cards to enhance your decks. Each race has a variety of racial abilities to choose from. Up to two racial abilities can be chosen. The deck size is 30. There is no consequence to overdrawing from the deck like in other games. The fatigue is instead implemented by giving a direct damage spell every round after 12.

Every turn grants 5 mana. The max mana amount is 10. The amount of mana per turn and cap can change depending on what cards are in play.

The maximum hand size is 5. Cards are drawn until the hand is completely filled every turn. This means that card draw is never a problem for any deck. 1 card can also be discarded for a draw every turn.

The balance between the races/decks is very poor. Currently one race is extremely weak, one race is in a good spot, and one race is extremely overpowered.

There is a very wide variety of decks. No cards are extremely OP or game ending. There are no OTKs either. There are combos, but they need to be set up and planned. There is plenty of hard removal and ae removal along with a lot of interesting creatures with synergies between them. There are also a variety of themes that can overlap with each other to make a pretty dynamic deck.

Your health is split up among several crystals on the board. There are several boards each with their own configuration. You are given 24 health. A player can deploy one row up once any one crystal is destroyed.

Ranged units can't attack anything right next to them. This means that they can't return attacks when hit by melee.


I'd rate it as recommended or a very diverse landscape of decks. We can only hope that future balance patches will improve the meta as decks become feasible. Strategy??? Oh Yes, when you have all legendary cards but how to do that if even there is no daily mission? The only way to get card in this game is Bank Card, if not, you have to spend years to get the strategy of the game!

1102040,Obversion,game,False,"28 Jan, 2020",Indie,Obversion is a challenging yet accessible abstract first-person puzzle platformer set in a vibrant universe of cubes.,"I am not too enthusiastic about puzzle platformers in general, since far too many of them are focusing on platform part, which become a bottleneck even if I could deal well with the puzzle parts. So coming across a game of the genre that has included an automove/autojump mechanism to deal with that annoyance certainly sounds promising.

And, well, that was the part I liked in the game and highly recommend other game developers to lift that. 

Now, the rest of the game: there's still the problem of first-person platforming that trying to get the cube creation/destruction to hit the point which you actually want to hit: eventually can be done (and if not, there's unlimited undo) but gives its bits of frustration. But even worse are the collectibles and secrets, which you are apparently supposed to just find in random. jump off the platforms in random directions, repeat and repeat and repeat. Destroy random cubes to see if there is something there, undo, repeat and repeat and repeat.
I wonder if there are some functions and commands I am missing here or am I really supposed to be doing that? Something reasonably simple like having a rotatable level selection screen would already make the game a bit more palatable. 
As it is, despite the promise in mechanics, I am just finding it annoying. Obversion is an outstanding and fiendishly difficult pure puzzle game. It takes one of the smallest movesets one can think of, i.e. mostly just the abilities to a) create a block or b) to destroy one, and builds an entire meaty game around them. Puzzle games typically introduce significant new powers over time to keep things fresh. Obversion opts for the more interesting approach of making only minor new additions to the moveset, while keeping the gameplay remarkably varied due to exceptional level design. (And as a neat aside, by centering the game around two opposing abilities, it neatly parallels its yin-yang motif.)

Level Design

Regarding that level design: the levels become much weirder than the first few might lead one to believe. And the puzzles constantly make you feel that ""this is impossible"". This is in large part due to the tight resource management (like in another excellent hidden gem, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/MondSemmel/recommended/1581890]The Magic of Three[/url]): to use an ability, you must first find a pickup that lets you use it, and those pickups are not only very scarce but often also pretty challenging to find or reach in the first place.

Difficulty

The overall result is an unrepentantly challenging puzzle game. Just solving the levels is already hard enough, but each one also contains an optional yin-yang pickup, and obtaining those ramps up the challenge even more. I occasionally wished the dev had made an easier difficulty mode with 1-2 extra resources in some levels. Instead, you can get an optional hint for each level at no penalty. Those hints are good, but obviously there's a limit to how helpful a 1-liner can possibly be. Addendum: I ultimately figured it was a pity that the game couldn't offer more help if you got stuck, and thus wrote a hints-based [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2840818550]Steam guide[/url] for it.

Anyway, despite these tight resource constraints and the high difficulty, level solutions surprisingly aren't always unique - after 100%ing the game I watched a couple solutions by someone else, and at times the details of their solutions differed from mine.

Observation

A surprising amount of the challenge can be remedied by careful observation: the game lavishly rewards paying attention to detail. In particular, the level select screen provides an isometric view onto the actual level, so you can sometimes see pickups that might be obscured once you're in the level.

A few maze levels can be understood much better from the bird's eye view before entering them; the pyramid level does something really clever with regards to observation; and e.g. the final level is incomprehensibly complex in-game but much more comprehensible from the level select screen. Finally, I solved 2-3 levels by semi-brute-force, then discovered afterwards that the game had hidden tons of information around the level.

Other than that, the puzzles are also often cerebral enough, especially given the resource constraints, that they strongly benefit from taking some notes, which I enjoyed.

Accessibility

Putting the game's high difficulty level aside, it's otherwise surprisingly accessible: besides a robust undo-redo system, it optionally offers two powerful accessibility features: Firstly, with automove, if you point at a spot that would be reachable from your position with perfect control, you can make your character automatically move there at the press of a button. And secondly, autojump makes your character jump automatically if you move off a cliff or towards a wall. These two features let you remove all mechanical challenges from the game so you can concentrate just on the considerable cerebral ones. And these features also make the gameplay much smoother, e.g. stairs are faster to climb with autojump.

Conclusion

I highly recommend Obversion. I've played tons of puzzle games over the years, and this one was a favorite. Wonderful little puzzle game. By the end, there are some real brain busters, in terms of logical complexity. The procedural and mathematical art style is pretty, technically impressive, and compliments the gameplay well, and the philosophical musings scattered about give the whole proceeding a little more personality than it otherwise could have had. The accessibility features are definitely a nice touch, and let you focus on the puzzle aspect, which is the crux of the experience. The soundtrack is lovely and well-composed, though I would've probably liked some more upbeat tracks interspersed throughout to give the whole thing a little energy boost every now and again and keep things interesting. Some puzzles (usually the optional ""challenge"" ones) require some kind of esoteric movement or block maneuver that I wish was telegraphed more later in the main game, such that I could come back to them and re-ponder with new knowledge in tow. (though, full disclosure: I have not FULLY beaten the game yet, but have made it 20 or so levels in). Overall, the difficulty curve feels good - not to tough, not too gentle. Anyhow... long story short: this game is great for any fan of puzzles, and is criminally overlooked. Its a good deal for the money, even more so when on sale. Recommended for gamers of all skill levels and backgrounds. Obversion is a complex yet elegant platform puzzler. You can work your way through it without significant struggle or you can take time to ruminate on the puzzles. The difficulty does ramp up through the worlds and you may find yourself with a puzzle that requires more thought than blindly barreling forward.

The music is a special gem. I wouldn't want to spoil it for prospective players, but what I can say is that it compliments the levels and builds on itself as you progress.

The dev put a lot of thought into movement mechanics and it seems that the puzzles have been mapped out and thoroughly thought through. I found myself stumped in one place or another until I noticed a pattern or subtle hint.

I really love the undo/redo system. It makes messing up easily fixable and it enhances exploration.

All in all, Obversion is a Fantastic 3D puzzler that will give you challenge and Great Joy upon finding your Yin Yangs. A lovely, easy to learn, and hard to master puzzle game. A fascinating art style paired with fiendishly clever puzzles with multiple solutions, hidden objects and a forgiving undo system? A 3D platformer that has an optional jump mode that will auto-jump to a given location so you can focus on just playing? Absolutely. The game's difficulty ramps up as you progress through the 28 levels, each of which poses unique challenges. It's not hard to work through them, though: with mechanics that are easy to pick up on without explanation (except for controls, shown when starting the game), plenty of accessibility features (those being autojump, automove, and the undo/redo buttons) that can make it easy to traverse over obstacles, and a free hint that can be picked up at the start of every level, plenty of help is given for players to work through the rather complex nature of 3D first-person puzzlers. Observation, planning, and cleverness are key in order to reach the end of all of the puzzles made, even more so with the bonus yin-yang collectibles.

Overall, I would recommend this game for pure puzzle-solvers, for there is not much else offered besides a few philosophical quotes shown when passing through some transparent spheres found on a few select levels. This game is a abstract minimalist 3D Puzzle Game with First-Person POV controls.
I like these things.

The secrets are also a lot of fun to find/complete. A simple but well flushed out puzzle game around the mechanic of adding and removing blocks to reach a destination. Visuals are simple but with enough flair to remain interesting to look at. The mechanics evolve a fair amount, but remain committed to the same theme. There are surprisingly robust undo and auto-jumping systems. While I initially turned off auto-jump, I realized that it removed some of the frustrating platformer execution problems that this type of setting would normally create. 

As with many puzzle games there were a few levels that I found frustrating to solve, but that was made up for by the levels I really enjoyed. Each level has an additional, harder objective to complete which made some of my favorite levels really shine. I'm not a completionist and thus collecting all of them did not appeal to me. Each level was structured around a visual or structural theme, which kept levels feeling different. One side thing I look for in puzzle games is an interesting puzzle packed into a small design space, and some of the levels in Obversion particularly scratched that itch for me which was great. I'm not normally a puzzle game guy, but Obversion really hooked me. 

It starts off simple, with the basic idea of adding and removing cubes from a beautiful TRON like world to solve puzzles, but it quickly starts to remix its own concepts in a way that I found quite delightful. There's a level in the second world where I literally burst out loud laughing when I saw what the game was doing‚Äîunexpected but totally made sense within the rules that had been set up so far.

It's not an easy game‚Äîprepare your thinking caps‚Äîbut it is absolutely fair, so you really get that Eureka rush of insight when you finally figure out the solution to a puzzle. The whole undo system/auto jump/auto move is something I WISH more games had. 

Overall: strongly recommend it! If you liked games like Portal or The Witness then you'll really enjoy this! I have really enjoyed playing Obversion. It creates an atmosphere that gets me into a nice, meditative flow state. I really appreciate the time and effort put into creating the many different puzzles in the game, and I'm pleasantly surprised by the number of different variations on puzzles the developer found within the constraints of the mechanics of creating and destroying blocks.
The progression of the game through the different worlds has a feeling of slowly descending deeper into the depths of the analytical mind, and the shifts in aesthetic and mood as the game progresses have mysterious tone, like peering further into the void. The different quotes on duality peppered throughout the game are insightful and apropos. I highly recommend this game, especially if you are the introspective and inquisitive type.",0.10954124800988277

Hell, if they had just removed all cutscenes and character-interactions, even the so-called ""English"" version could have been fine... But, as it stands, most of the text and voice-acting in the non-French version is significantly worse than even google-translate would have been.

The base game was cool, the DLC's were nice add-ons.
Recommended for all my turn-based RPG enthousiasts! Pretty fun game. Tactics are decent, and there's that hottie Felicia Day who voices one of the characters. On the other hand - very silly. Bought this on discount and it is *definitely* worth it.  Kudos to the Devs! Fun combat, funny dialogue and interesting characters (makes sense, it's based on an audiobook) with good banter. Pretty art and good voice acting as well. I like it. Ce jeu est vraiment cool.

Determined to find his sister, the young man ventures into the perilous and dark world of Terminal 81.","I really have mixed feelings about this one.

In one hand, it is not a bad game. But on the other hand, I felt that this game was longer than it should have been.
The game has some new minigames here and there, but most of them don't add that much to say that it is a ""better"" game than the original 'Terminal 81.'
In fact, I think that this is even inferior in some aspects, because it ends up feeling more monotonous and repetitive than the first one.
The driving mechanics are not very good, and I ALWAYS preferred to walk than to ride the bike.

I also felt that wasting so much time talking to every random character walking on the street wasn't necessary either; most of the conversations are uninteresting and shallow anyway.
__________________________________________________________

UPDATE: I just finished the game (I got one of the bad endings).
I must say that the last part where you are stuck in the abandoned building with the two flashlight guys was fun but also frustrating.

That being said, this game has some really nice moments, and the story actually got more interesting by the end.
In fact, it actually had a very sad plot-twist that I was not expecting, and it is something that you cannot change, regardless of how many different decisions you take in the game.
You could get a ""good ending,"" but the outcome remains the same.
It's pretty sad, but I'm personally a fan of sad endings, so this actually made me increase my rating a little bit.
The story of this game ended up being superior to the original, so now I give it a 7.5/10 to this one.

At this point, I really cannot say which of these two games is better or worse.
The first game is superior in some aspects, but inferior in others; the same goes with this one. 
So, I think this is basically a tie.

honestly not a lot going for it, even after reading other reviews and thinking that one should take a look...

- screen resolution is unchangeable (if it is, it's not in-game!)
- fonts are non-scaleable, thus on newer monitors, you'll need to be practically nose-to-screen to read anything
- like other reviews have stated, this is pre-alpha stage, ie wait for some proper development (like the release of more than just skirmish mode)
- stupidly slow even on a reasonable pc (suggests either code is too spacious or incompatible due to programming language issues)

as the last update was over a year ago, and the latest one just happens to be the release of wallpapers, you're better off skipping this game for another year or two (assuming the developers are planning to return from a year-long hiatus etc) Just so you know.
This game is a virus.
If not then i'd be plenty of suprise because my anti-virus is usually right.
Just be careful. I felt like i was becoming claustrophobic with some mild catatonia while trying to play this game. super confusing, nothing really teaches you anything..... and you have to read print that is so small.... that it feels rushed.

couldnt figure the game out at all.

 Game freezes up every five minutes of gameplay!!!!!!

this alpha release is trash for testing.. Would be nice if their was a tutorial, or training button accually worked in the game? Other than that, i have no flippin clue on what to do, or how to do it? People like to hear what to do, or how to do it from the game. In my years as a gamer, i have never had to read so much learning curve  on a game like this one. If i don't figure it out soon, i will be refunding that simple. L.E.
Game is dead. Don't buy.

...........
Initial review:

Looks promising and, even more promising, is the patch release rate I'm seeing so I won't ask for a refund.
Certainly in need of a 'tutorial' type of help, even if it's in the form of overlayers with text that describe a bit more the relation between modules, etc. 
If development continues at this rate I will certainly be happy I've grabbed it now as it certainly worths more once polished.

If you're buying it now don't expect to play some sort of ""space Skyrim"" level of details in the next 5 mins, look at it as supporting a developer that puts out weekly updates. Hope of humanity is to difficult to play without a working tutorial. ..
tutorial inside only tell you 1 thing.. 

but it might be a fun game later on :) this games video looks fun to play I like toe idea of building a base and mining etc, but in the cuurent state I will have to warn anyone that this game is not what the video shows not even close, not to mention there is no tutorial now I have been fiddling around but I cant figure out heads from tale, 

The english thing I can look past since they did say the translation is not done but I always wonder what goes through a developers mind when you try to launch a game when the main accept language in the world is not even in your game, to me it feels like yoru aiming low or dont care.

Wont refund, as I do support there idea, but will keep this as a negative rating till I see some form of improvement. The game has some promise, and i'll definitely give it another try later on to update this review if things improve but this has definitely entered early access WAY too early in development. To the devs: I would highly recommend (if you even can...) to take this out of early access until you have fleshed things out a bit more, otherwise you are going to ruin the chances of this game doing well.

The current pros/cons
- i love the idea (although I wasn't actually able to properly experience it, so I can't 100% confirm that the game plays as is advertised)
- initially looks pretty promising visually
- nice audio from what I have heard so far

The cons:
- zero tutorial or ANY form of guide/help, for a game that is designed to have complexity (an example of why this shouldn't be in early access yet)
- although it boasts english support, certain sections of the game are not translated to english, particularly parts that look to be quite important. This might actually be why I felt like there was zero guide/help at the beginning. Community hub posts suggests this issue will be fixed, but again another example that this shouldn't be available yet!
- the performance of the game is absolutely terrible. It is stated currently that the game does need optimization, however it's rediculous to release it when it performs as bad as it does. I get to roughly 30-40 enemies on the screen and the game dips to very low fps, making it virtually unplayable, and my PC can handle high-end games normally very well.

Again, I will come back and update this if the game improves, which I hope it does because the idea does seem really cool. However, right now, for the sake of giving this game a chance, don't pick it up until it shows evidence of improvement!",-0.020063311688311696

Gear Up Marines: This DLC includes several new helmets, outfits, weapon skins, emotes and decals. It also comes with some in game currency (both types) and consumables. Unlike the previous DLC I did find myself using these Skins, specifically the MK.75 Suits. I will say that the skins are adequately done and detailed but found the weapon decals overly pointless due to the size.

Just like the previous DLC this is not going to have any real effect on your game.  However, I will recommend it if you grab it on a sale but it would still be better to just get the Deluxe Edition (while on sale) and save some money for what is primarily cosmetic. Enjoy!

The graphics are terrible and the maps are incomplete, the physics are purposely annoying and crappy, it's just... not fun. It's funny for the first 5 minutes when you find out that this character is totally clumsy and even walking straight is a challenge, but then it just kinds of stagnates there.

Overall, poorly made and clunky satire game about being clumsy. i bought this as a child and thought it would be good.

In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you goin' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
How could be so Dr. Evil
You bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't goin' speak so
Why we up three A.M. on the phone
Why does she be so mad at me for
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, I won't mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just goin' keep hatin' me
And we just goin' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm goin' take off tonight
Into the night
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

Walk, talk, drink, dance, smoke, watch, sauna, trip and find Alex. An Aussie stoner noir story game by Convict Games.","Very short game about an LGBT Koala that lost his lover.

Had to replay the Epilogue like 4 times before it would register the last two achievements.

Would I recommend the game ?
Not really , but I'll still give it a positive review because Aussie developers , Aussie lingo and a bad ass koala named Stone. stone is my pookie my babygirl my one and only my loser failboy i love him So............this is not a great game, and it has numerous flaws.........but it's also not entirely awful (I seriously wouldn't recommend you buy it mind you, unless it's on a [b][u]DEEP[/u][/b] sale!

This is a third-person ""mystery"" where  you play a hard partying koala trying to track down his missing lover, although for all intents and purposes it's essentially a visual novel as there is no real detecting to do, and there certainly aren't multiple outcomes or anything like that.  Just wander around (and the objectives in the upper left of the screen certainly leave no mystery about what you're to do next) and click your mouse and/or press E and the story will unfold.

*[b]Positives[/b]*

-Story-  It's actually not a bad story, and if the game were put together competently (hint:  It's not) this would be a lot more compelling of a game.

-Graphics-  They're not great, but they're colourful and the models for the various animals are decent, and there's even a few nice little graphical touches, like how the screen develops a blur if you have too many drinks (not that it lasts beyond the building you're in.....just leave and, BOOM, instant sobriety).

-Music/Movies-  The soundtrack is decent (even if there's WAY too much crappy hip-hop and techno shite compared to the amount of rock music) and there's opportunities to watch entire public domain movies at the theatre or on your television (NIght of the LIving Dead, etc.) which is a nice touch.

*[b]Negatives[/b]*

-Voice Acting-  How on bloody earth can a game made in Australia feature such weak, inconsistently accented voice acting?!?!?  I mean, you're hiring Aussies to do your voices, hire someone for the main character that actually sounds like an Ozzie 100% of the time rather than drifting in and out of some bizarre, almost Australian accent similar to Kevin Kostner's attempts at an English accent in that shite Robin Hood movie from decades ago.  Some of the characters are okay, but even the ones with decent (and consistent!) accents deliver some of the weakest line readings in video game history.  Truly not good

-Voice Syncing-  It's terrible.  Really.  Old Japanese kaiju movies had better, more synced up dubbing than this.  It's distractingly bad.

-Pacing-  It's soooooooooo slow, and I don't just mean in terms of plot progression, I mean character movement, line delivery, huge pauses between lines, everything that could make the game feel punchier and more responsive feels like treacle.

-Character Freedom-  Despite the fact that there's multiple locations on the world map, three of them are meaningless (the record store just allows you to listen to music, the theatre just plays a movie for you to watch, and the sauna just features the protagonist sitting in a steam filled room) and the rest have perfunctory interactions (with badly, sloooooooooooooooowly delivered, poorly read dialogue) that will only occur if it's that time in the story-line.....otherwise there's nothing to do beyond progress the plot).

So, it has some good points (decent story-line if someone else was writing and delivering the dialogue, colourful graphics with some nice touches, and some potential to interact with a wide selection of music and movies within the game), but the rest is dragged down with a bloody anchor by the rather poor voice acting, line delivery, lack of in-game freedom, lethargic dialogue and a raft of minor narrative issues.  At least it's over quickly and there's no bugs that I encountered.... ........... ..........................

Sadly not recommended. It might have been because I was playing under Proton, but the game misbehaved at several level transitions. (2 of the Steam achievements failed to trigger.) The actual gameplay wasn't much, which would be excusable if the narrative part was great, but it was just okay. I did enjoy the twist ending though.
If you're looking at this thinking you'd love to roleplay as an inebriated koala, maybe go for something like VRChat instead? This is a walking simulator with few decision branches. With memory loss likely in cahoots with the groggy slushing in his head, the PI koala wakes to find his boyfriend missing. it seems both yesterday and today are co-conspirators of the same hangover, playing out tumultuous loops in his mind! will the stoned Dick crack the case ..or crack A case and watch night of the living dead while blitzed off his gourde?

interesting enough game that travels a short distance but packs for the winter!
Art is good. game moves smoothly (no run). voice over is all on point, it is mostly casual down beat conversing, with askew personal sequences and revelation.
true to say that it is not really a puzzle game, it is mostly concerned with telling story. 
so i guess depending on your preference you could consider it a really casual game or an incredibly well stocked novel or visual/audio presentation.
It has packed not only a pretty dam fair selection of rock hip hop and other music but also has roughly 2 plates of cb-cookies worth of actual full movies you can watch in game! (noice!)
although the dude acheivment doesnt unlock for me.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3168503975
it was a steep hard climb to emotional high ground and I was looking for a sniper! As an Australian, it was a no brainer to pick up a game about a rough around the edges Koala on a mission to solve a mystery. I finally decided to give it a go after it sat in my library for a while, and while it wasn't what I expected, I genuinely enjoyed the experience that Stone had to offer. 

I should emphasise that this game is very much an experience and not a traditional noir game. You won't be solving puzzles or trying to choose the right responses, but exploring the universe that the devs built, while following along in the player-guided narrative. 

I really enjoyed the music and how it helped create distinct atmospheres in each location. I will definitely be following up on some of my favourite tracks from this game. 

The characters are the heart and soul of this game. If you're Australian, and visited some of the smaller towns out of the big city, than these personalities are definitely ones you'd come across. It was comforting and comical, with dialogue definitely something you'd hear if you eavesdropped at a bar - maybe minus kidnapping discussion. 

This game might be a bit more difficult to digest if you're not Australian, and expecting more of a 'game' than a visual novel. But if you're willing to give it a shot, it's certainly a ride! 

Thanks to the devs and everyone involved! I look forward to your future projects and can't wait to see what you produce in the future! I'm 50/50 really... On the one hand it is really cute and feels very personal on some levels. I think the devs mean really well. And the soundtrack is super.
However, the writing would have needed to be a little bit more snappy, at times the voice lines overlap, the mystery is easily figured out, and the overall tempo is off.
It could have been elevated with better voice actors, but hey, it is what it is. It's pretty unique I'd say, and I appreciate that. But it could had been so much more. I love detective games and I love LGBTQIA+ plots, but this ain't it.

This game is let down by overly simplistic graphics, annoying club music, lazy writing, and poor voice acting. It does have some classic films you can watch, but if I wanted to watch a movie, I'd be doing that, not playing a game.

3/10. It gave me a headache. This is a simplistic single-player story game where you play as a hungover/stoned ""ex-detective"" Koala named Stone trying to find out about a friend that has been kidnapped. The writing leans from predictable to average at best and isn¬¥t a very memorable experience in general BUT the soundtrack is amazing and for me, that¬¥s worth the purchase of this game (at least on sale). 

The soundtrack on this game makes it more interesting to explore/reach 100% completion. The game somehow wasn¬¥t boring and it definitely has a style to it. Just a slightly above average game.

My final rating for this game is a (low) 6/10. Not worth more than $1.  Took 1.9hrs to 100% .  Really simple and kind of boring, the soundtrack is good though.",-0.0013768848812516945

Has a total of [b]7[/b] trading cards. Game is unplayable due to lag Just another boring RPG, nothing special. Just skip it. I am 32 years old.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you. RPG Maker strikes again!

Arevan is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flips spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, ""Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.""  Like all RPG Maker ""games"", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.

As with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for ""professional"" game development.

This time Andorlea/Warfare/SimProse/whatever other shell account this guy uses to try hide his identity has once more stamped out a painfully generic copy + paste RPG Maker asset flip.  This time we're investigating a murder in one of the most incredibly, painfully generic fantasy settings imaginable.  If RPG Maker had generic plots, the developer here would rip those off, too.  It's horribly basic, riddled with grammatical and spelling errors, full of stock copy + pasted RPG Maker assets... no real game development has taken place here, this is just a cash grab, it's shovelware polluting Steam for profit.  This ""developer"" has dumped over 100 copy+pasted RPG Maker asset flips onto Steam, and keeps pumping out minimum viable product RPG Maker asset flips as rapidly as possible to try gouge gamers.

We must ask why this ongoing pollution has any serious value for gamers or the gaming industry.  This kind of cash grab construction kit shovelware from bad actors like Andorlea gives amateur developers a bad name.  This pollution takes marketing space away from genuine indie developers who are doing the right thing, and making real games instead of copying+pasting premade assets in a children's video game construction kit.  It makes it harder for gamers to find genuinely made games.  This pollution is harmful to Steam, to gamers and the gaming industry.

Like most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this only appears around the same time that trading cards were applied to the game... so this is just card idlers getting their cards and moving on.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Arevan has the laughable, eye-watering price of around $5 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam.  Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.

 Just another RPG game that you should probably avoid. Recommended for game farming Cool classic RPG. The world are wide and there are lot of things and places to explore. The story is deep and twisted. Even tho sometimes it was hard to find the quest items, but u can finish them all by doing some exploring and talking to a lot of NPC because their quests sometimes solve other quest.

209850,Highborn,game,False,"19 Feb, 2013","Casual, Indie, Strategy","This witty, wacky, turn-based strategy game is now available for Steam. In Highborn, you‚Äôre treated to a strategy game that offers an intelligent, tactical experience without the frenetic play of a traditional RTS.","I've had this game sitting in my library for about 10 years, and I finally decided to play it. I'm glad I did. It may be old, but it's a lot of fun to play. I ended up buying all 3 chapters because I enjoyed it so much.

The scenarios are interesting to play, the characters are unique, and the humor is goofy. The jokes either made me smile or roll my eyes at the corniness. This game definitely does not take itself too seriously, and occasionally makes fun of itself. I found the normal difficulty level to be too easy, so I had to play everything on hard for the right challenge. The graphics may not be the latest and fanciest compared to the latest games out there, but they're certainly good enough.

I did encounter a couple annoying bugs. There are a couple scenarios where critical units disappear when I saved the game and reloaded later, making it impossible to finish the level. This was solved by restarting the level, but it was a bummer to have to play it over again. I recommend finishing each level in one sitting, which generally takes no more than a couple hours. 

At the current price, this game is well worth the money, so there's little to lose in trying it out. An old nostalgia dose for me, remember playing this when i was just a child, doesnt disappoint. Oh, you're interested in buying this? Just don't. I normally give games a little longer to improve, but it was clearly going nowhere good. Play a free version of snake on your phone rather than this. Stare at a wall and analyse the paint instead. It's not a game, so much as a really long tutorial with no real challenge or fun.

Also, the base game has achievements you can't unlock, without purchasing DLC content. Simple but fun game, enjoyed all three chapters. Turn based combat is easy to pick up and just deep enough that how you use the units matters.  Dialog is very funny and makes fun of itself the whole way through. Example, ""How did you know I was the villain? Well you are on the box art for the game! Oh I hate when they just give it away like that, where's the suspense."" Is good. fun little hex game Awesome game. 
Fun simple combat, bright old school visuals, and hilariously cheesy and cliched plot.
An infinite amount of fun and silliness for a great price.

You are a muscle-bound knight reuniting a fractured kingdom to defeat the dark forces of the evil lich. Daft plot, but solid turn-based wargame strategy to be had.

Hopefully the assets for the game can open source as they gorgeous! This Game had fun game play, but they never had intentions of running it, this company was a scam. I REALLY WANT ""SEA"" SERVER SO MUCH!!! Oh boy, what can I say.

I should start with stating that I extensively played ELOA and followed the release before it came to America. I had really high hopes for the original American release rightfully so, the game had high potential.

Pros at the time
     Fluid Combat
     Creative Art style
     Relatively balanced pvp
     Good group content

Cons at the time
     Massive Payment wall for enchanting
     Unfair advantage in PvP from equipment
     No meaningful way to progress solo
     Raids were more dependant on Equipment to reach a DPS
     (Had to compromise when selecting members who paid for gear)
     Slow PAINFUL Boring grind to reach any content that is fun
     Max level increasing and all end-game content being locked to it
     (To continue to PvP you had to re-level again from 25/30/35/40 etc.)

To be fair that was all in the original release and I don't know what's all changed since.
All I can say is the grind was substantially worse than I remember it being aside from:
Cash shop seemed uninspired, lots of copy/paste no real improvements to changes.
Skills were totally messed up from the original game balance breaking certain things.

I can't say I tried any of the end-game content because by the time I realized they re-released this game the population was already dead and the game wouldn't allow me to progress past level 30 in the story line because Mud Swamp was completely glitched.

If you think you can make it through the mind-numbing grind to max level you will find a game that might be worth the PvP experience, but honestly I don't think the game is going to last long enough to give you a good enough try to get your moneys worth. Great potential, poor delivery in both instances. Doesn't run, gamegaurd maybe?

Nevertheless, the faction is not one of my favorites, but more content is more content:) Honestly a Amazing faction for the game, totally Artillery only is not a horribly broken strategy Parrot guns go pew pew and shatter enemy At a glance the Saga are very obviously one of the most enjoyable factions to play in Fall of the Samurai and this is very much true. The Saga start with a great starting location and buffs that support a huge economy, navy & the best units in the game ‚Äì modern artillery. 

The Saga starting location is very good. They start with Nagasaki that has a smuggling den and trading port that can be quickly made into a foreign trading port. They start near the French and British trade nodes, and are on the bottom of the map and so they can easily protect their trade. They also start off already trading with these powers netting lots of early game income. The Geisha agents from the smuggling will net tens of thousands of Koku over the course of the game while garrisoned and the foreign adventurers from the port will make armies extremely elite & counter most other agents. Next to Nagasaki is the coal rich Hizen province that the Saga can fully exploit with their 20% bonus to industry income. These two provinces are on their own peninsula and can be easily defended from land and building a navy should be no problem with their solid starting economy. The nearby island of Tsushima has a gold resource that can be used to fund industry. 

The most obvious strengths of the Saga are their bonuses to artillery and their navy. Naval strength is everything in Fall of the Samurai due to the ability of naval bombardments to destroy coastal cities, and ports. Navies are also extremely expensive so a -10% recruitment and upkeep bonus goes a long way. With their foreign port the Saga are well positioned to get the first steam ship and steamroll every other navy, destroy enemy cities and support land armies with naval bombardments. They also have no reason not to use lots of overpowered modern artillery as theirs is made even accurate for no cost. 

The Saga are a great faction with really no downsides. They are well positioned to fully embrace industrialization and a modern military. They have the best faction stats and a great starting position, but not the best starting position so there is still some challenge. 
 Who would win? 

A) A caste of swordsman, with skills honed over hundreds of years
B) Gun. The Only interesting DLC clan in FOTS,

artillery spam is actually viable for this clan + gg I say, what what? So far the game is interesting and enjoying using 19 century weaponry. It plays at a slower pace. THERE ARE GLITCHES WHERE I'VE WON BATTLES AND HAD TO FIGHT THEM AGAIN. I read about glitches in reviews written when it first came out...seems they still haven't been fixed. I'll carry on playing but this is a disappointment and wastes precious time!",0.1858
452340,Ian's Eyes,game,True,"1 Sep, 2016","Adventure, Indie","First days at school are usually tough, but they can be even tougher if you‚Äôre helping a blind 8-year-old boy named Ian who doesn't know the terrifying dangers that lurk around in every hallway. You play as North, Ian‚Äôs lifelong canine companion. Can you help him escape alive?","Great Idea, TERRIBLE execution. The only thing this game has going for it is the neat story of a blind kid needing to get around an apocalyptic school. But then the awful tank controls, spotty checkpoints, one-shot/inconsistent enemy aggro ranges and down right stupid dialogue tanks that concept and pile drives it straight into the ground. Just save your money and buy something else. Really bad voice acting. Really boring gameplay. Really cool idea, but bad, and i mean just awful execution. i feel bad. i REALLY wanted to like this game but it just ended up not working out. the death counter just makes it seem like its meant to be hard. i wouldnt know ill never finish it. again i wanted to like it but it just wasnt meant to be. The controls are really bad.. You can't move the camera angle and you walk with the arrows on the keyboard. The ''Use'' button is ''S''. On the steam controller you walk with the arrows and the ''Use'' button on the controller is the joystick that you have to move around until its interracting with the item. Well, this is certainly something different: a Unity-made stealth-horror game which ISN'T in first-person, and even dares to look a bit ""spooky-cute""! Unfortunately, the dissimilarity to a lot of other (frequently sub-par) Unity product ends somewhere around there. Perhaps it's best we get a little rant out of the way before I proceed any further:

   WHY IN GOD'S GOOD NAME DO YOU EUROPEAN INDIE DEVELOPERS INSIST UPON DOING YOUR OWN VOICE ACTING WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN SPEAK ENGLISH? AND WHY WOULD YOU WRITE DIALOGUE WITH WORDS LIKE ""CENTENARY"" BEING REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN...WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN PRONOUNCE THE WORD ""CENTENARY"" PROPERLY, FOR FUCK'S SAKE?!

   Okay, rant over. Apologies, but I did need to get that off my chest (which I've done a few times before, but one can only live in hope that someday someone might actually LISTEN)! When all is said and done, though, this would all be forgivable enough if we were talking about a stealth game where the stealth actually works. Regrettably, it doesn't. There's little consistency to how the A.I. will behave, meaning that learning from your mistakes still has about a 50/50 chance of biting you in the butt, and then it's aaaaaall the way back to a checkpoint five minutes prior to do it all over again (with varying results to the last time, no doubt).

   I couldn't help but be reminded of the legendary Bad Rats: fantastic premise (blind boy dodging zombie schoolkids with the aid of his guide dog), but the gameplay is so inconsistent and unpredictable that merely trying to repeat what worked for you the last time is a crap-shoot at best. The Resident Evil-style camera angles don't help much either: creeping around trying not to bump into uglies is no mean feat when one could be literally two inches in front of you, and you can't see or hear the fucker until you stumble headlong into them.

   I applaud the devs for the premise, I truly do. This had the potential to be the freshest horror game since Among the Sleep, but unfortunately the execution is severely lacking. This game might LOOK a bit like a three-dimensional Limbo, but trust me, it doesn't play like one. Limbo has an exemplary difficulty arc in which new mechanics are slowly introduced and extrapolated upon, whereas this game is insanely hard by about the thirty-minute mark.

   I dread to think what awaits beyond the hour-and-a-half I was willing to give it, because even slightly more challenging than what I've played so far is a little too close to ""impossible"" for my tastes. Unless, of course, you're one of those people who enjoys doing the same tediously pedantic bits over and over and over again, with absolutely no guarantee of success even when you plan things out to the nth degree. If so, you're in luck, 'cause someone made a game just for you.

   This really is one of the most heartbreaking reviews I've ever had to write, 'cause I sincerely had high hopes for this one. If ever a game cried out for a more competent remake, this'd be the one. The premise actually has ""hit"" written all over it, and it could no doubt appeal to a wide audience well beyond the established horror community. But the version we have here would need soooooo much work to make it even half of what it could be, so I sincerely question whether the devs should even bother. Restart from scratch, and give the new product to all the people who bought the first one for free; that'd be the best-case scenario in my book.

   Oh, and for fuck's sake: GET SOME VOICE ACTORS WHO SPEAK THE QUEEN'S LANGUAGE next time. There's this thing out there called the INTERNET, and not everyone on it speaks Pidgin English.

   Full marks to the devs for having the vision and determination to make this game, minus about 5.5/10 for the actual execution. Consider my heart partly broken, but my faith in human courage partially restored. Better luck/judgement next time.

Verdict: 4.5/10.

Cheers!) good gameplay but bad ending Don't let the trailers fool you.  This game may seem like a fun game to play, but you will get frustrated over and over again.  There are some good qualities to the game but also bad ones, unfortunately.

[u]Pros:[/u]
The graphics certainly catches my attention.  It kind of looks like the stop-motion animation or a CGI that looks like from Jimmy Neutron (bad example, sorry).

Another positive is that they have full controller support.  That is always a plus.

Also, check points are nicely spread out.  If you progress enough to another screen, the game may save from there thus avoiding many frustrations.  This also may be a bad thing for those who want a challenge but then again, there are many challenges a plenty for this game.

[u]Cons:[/u]
Voice acting needs a lot of work.  The voice actor for the principle doesn't seem to be putting any effort in the situation.  He seems to be reading from a script.  The voice acting for Ian was alright but sometimes certain situations doesn't match his enthusiasm.

Another problem is controls.  I can't speak for keyboard/mouse since I didn't use it for this game.  ""Freeze"" barking and ""attracting"" barking should've been on separate buttons.  Double tapping for the freeze bark is brutal.  It is difficult to utilize each bark properly because you are constantly running around avoiding zombies while trying to go for the freeze bark.  Sometimes I end up attracting the zombies instead.  The developers should've separated these two barks in two different buttons.

Map design is a big problem with this game.  Most sections in the game don't scroll like a bigger map.  They just stay fixed, so you are just moving from screen to screen.  This becomes a big problem because when you are moving to the next screen, sometimes you automatically bump right into the zombie.  There is no way of knowing that the zombie was right in front of you.  Also, the map angle changes at times.  When you are running from zombies, I sometimes end up walking back to the previous map.  I even sometimes run right into a wall or zombie that I was trying to avoid.

[u]Overall:[/u]
This game was meant to be frustrating and you are meant to die a lot; however, I felt most of the frustration is ""out-of-game"" rather than ""in-game"".  I felt I was more frustrated with the controls and bad camera angles which allowed me to die so often compared to the zombie layout.  I would've enjoyed the challenge of strategically maneuvering around zombies with feint barks but again controller issues and map design ruins it for me.

If I were to recommend this game, it would be for those who love a challenge.  For casual gamers, they should avoid this game.

I still give this game a thumbs up despite the many frustrations.  Developers do put a lot of effort in making this game.  The concept was good.  Story was okay.  CGI is nicely done.  Decent length of game time.  I just wish that the controller and map design were done better. Ian's eyes is one of the worst games I have ever played. It‚Äôs complete bull crap, but let‚Äôs start with the story first.

You play as Ian, a young blind boy starting his first day at a new school; everything is going okay, till the Principal shows an old slideshow to the school, which makes them into zombie. So it‚Äôs up to Ian and his dog North to escape.

Now let‚Äôs start with the good first. I liked the music and the idea for the game is interesting too. Now for bad. The story does not make one bit of sense. 

Hell even when you hear how all most all the school became zombies it still does not make sense. Then there is the protagonist Ian, he is one of the most stupidest people. 
Like when he gets to the Principal‚Äôs office, the Principal tells him to get a key from the library, and Ian does that. Even those he is blind and there are zombies running around.

Or when Ian gets hurt and asks his dog to get something for the pain, again, he asks his dog to get something for the pain. Now for the enemies. They are unpredictable and unfair in annoying way, what I mean by that is that you must get past them to get to safety/get to the next area.

But they are so unpredictable and even those there are blind, if you get to close to them, even if you are behind them they can still get you. Then there is the art/graphics style. Now to me, I don‚Äôt really care about that as long as there is a good story with some good characters. 

Hell I think it show you don‚Äôt need the best art/graphics style to make awesome and beloved game. But this game it show it art/graphics even the animation still needed some work. Voice acting too.  And the worst thing about this game is it had an interesting idea but completely screwed it up.

So with all that being said don‚Äôt get this game, even those I got this on sale, I still feel like I got ripped off. This game is not exactly what you'd expect it to be from looking at the trailer. 

You play as a blind kid, which in itself is an interesting premise. However, the game throws in 'zombies' that you have to avoid. This could be awesome were it not for the fact that the controls are incredibly hard to handle and that there is no true method to avoid being detected. This makes this game very frustrating to play. The enemies are unpredictable and no amount of stealthiness can avoid them seeing you. I didn't last 20 minutes before I got too annoyed to continue.

I was lucky to have gotten this game at a discounted price because it definitely isn't worth the full price. I guess you should check it out if you want a good rage game and you have a way to get it at a lower price. If you are thinking on buying it, i advise you to DOWNLOAD the Demo first!
It looks like a neat and interesting game, but the mechanics are really bad.

Controlling two chars gets frustrating, considering you will get caught pretty easy.

Sorry Devs. I asked for my refund. It's shit and I'm disappointed.

The concept is cool but the bad voice acting, bad story, and game mechanics ruined it (seriously if they didn't use voice acting at all would be better somehow). The controls are awkward like when you play as a dog you can't bark and move quickly to dodge the enemy.

I could ignore the bad voice acting and the bad story, but man... the enemies.
The enemies are unpredictable in unfair annoying way, like you can't tell whos that enemy that stand still or the one that stand still also but will attack you without a warning when you get close to him and not avoidable. Or enemy that patrols and ignores you if you walk by him or the enemy that patrols and suddenly chases you once you're close to him which it is not aviodable after. And sometimes when you use the dogs to check them out they wouldn't chase it, but when you move fucking Ian they suddenly attack him then.

Oh yeah, not to mention the enemies that works as a wall but you can't tell because they look like the others who would attack you. Because they all use random models and not giving them any unique appearance.


They expected you to die alot that they even bothered to make death counter for it.

Take out wacky foes and eccentric bosses to become the best shooter in Baffoland.,"Shoot 'em knives. That's how you get past the pink WOKE, whatever that is. I can't help but be dissapointed because it took me 40 minutes to figure out. That and play this with anything othe than a mouse. Frankly if you play this with a gamepad, I fell sorry for you, and also for me at 5 minutes in the game. Now I am finally in the second level, after trying stupidly to hit the pink WOKE vs hitting the knives that pink WOKE was hurling. 

Deep breath. This is a really nice shooter that doesn't take itself too seriously. Like westerns? Play this. The cartoons are so stylish that look more to painted targets in a shooting range rather than actual humans. So if you don't wanna shoot at people, which is completerly understandable, think of them as paper targets. Having said that, the mechanics there, aka ""hitting the knife also hurts the knife thrower, so you don't need to shoot at the knife thrower, just the knife"" are very arcadey, so actually don't take this too seriously. Just shooty fun at painted cards in a shooting range.  Or outside a circus. No need to reload guns or reframe paper targets. Just fun, fun, fun. Especially when you get to shoot at the pink WOKE...  DON'T. JUST SHOOT AT THE KNIVES HE THROWS. REALLY. THIS KEPT ME IN THE FIRST LEVEL FOR 40 MINUTES. [h1]SUMMARY[/h1]
""Wild Baffo"", more like ""Wildly Baffled"".

This railshooter is a western-themed shooting gallery. Enemies are designed to look like cartoonish cutouts, the environments are somewhat interactable, and the music levels are stereotypically on point. Where it fails is in the details, unfortunately. The gameplay has a few neat little features, such as shooting the knives of enemies and it goes right back at them, killing them, or shooting the bottles of alcohol thrown at you, stunning enemies in a radius where you shot it. Unfortunately that's about as involved as it gets. There's no reload mechanic, there's no alternate weapons, the levels are short and end up recycling themselves when you get to the bosses...

Which, speaking of the bosses, that is my biggest peeve with the game. It's not enough that they move and shoot faster and faster as you damage them, but their healthbar is fucking huge. So much so, my finger actually began to get fatigued from how much I was clicking on him. Sorry, but I'm not straining myself to beat a ""Wild Baffo"" boss.

On top of this, the premise of the story is eye-rollingly stupid. You're in search of a moustache to be a real gunslinger...Wow...Lock this game up and throw away the key, please.

Firstly, all of the heroes, terrain, assets are taken from their previous game Prime World and they didn't bother adding any new assets, even the fonts are the same. This should've been a game mode in prime world instead of its own standalone game. While the concept of Survival MOBA is rather neat, everything else is lacking - bad ping, boring & unbalanced characters, Sounds/Music are subpar, Graphics are outdated (Prime World came back in 2014)

There is not even proper menu or tutorial for the game. I ended up just getting qued with bots too, nobody is playing the game and i don't see why anyone would if it was Free To Play. Save your precious money by dodging the bullet with this one. I really enjoy this game, but it is a very niche product. If you enjoy the character variation of MOBAs (lots of characters with different passive/active abilities, ultimates, gaining items, etc) and you also like survival games with permadeath (first death = you're out of the match), then you'll enjoy this and it's at least worth the price of entry to check it out.

I am looking forward to future development of the game and seeing the population grow more. But definitely check this one out if you like MOBAs and survival / Battle Royale type games. Good game, but the lag is insane. Absolute dogshit",-0.0884107027724049

[h3]Some Rants[/h3]
In case dev is going to make a sequel:
- I manage to complete 100% achievements but could be easier if the game let me choose which slot to save game
- Superdash is kinda weird, please make it simpler
- Enemy corpse should not stop Superdash (seems like a bug or oversight)
- Also, even living enemy should not stop Superdash
- The weapons for Special Attack should not be random, preferably craft-able or collect-able
- Weapon Rite is very jebaiting, lol (I wasted many Glands early on)
- For Clay Rite, can be reworked for improvement (so far, I only choose +% Gland drop)
- The spells are fine BUT need rework and better design for sequel
- From my experience, I just need 1 more spell slot: 
>> Burst for opening doors (kept at Lv1 for low cost)
>> Chain Boulder 3 to deal with flying enemy
>> Extra spell slot for situation / preferred playstyle, i.e. Stone PIllar or Doppleganger
- Also, need to pause and swap for different spell is not good and breaking immersion (suggest to make all spells usable via pressing Spell key + arrow key; give player the freedom to choose which node on the techtree to modify the spell effects, etc)
- Spite bonuses would be perfect if I can reroll indefinitely, without dying. (i.e. upon maxed, Dark Mirror has the option to choose 1 Spite Bonus to discard it) Monotonous visuals, contrived story convoluted just for the sake of being ""mysterious"", sloppy and floaty combat that ends up in life-shortening hit trades as well as spams from flying enemies, since your attacks don't even stun foes. It feels like the parry doesn't even work half the time with the short timing window and issues fighting enemies occupying the exact same space as you. Just frustrating. I enjoyed this game a lot and even got all of its achievements. To me this was a 9/10 game, especially since it is an indie title from a very small developer. In fact I was surprised how well executed the overall game design was, many larger studios fail in delivering a similar high quality in comparison. Given the small number of people that worked on the title and probably the limited budget there is hardly anything I can criticize about the game.

(+) There are no annoying game play elements. No fall down damage (except if you fall in spikes etc.), save points are near boss encounters, no stupid character-being-stunned effects, no annoying enemies that can shoot you while you can't shoot back etc.
(+) The controls work flawlessly. I did not encounter any bugs and I intuitively understood the controls.
(+) Combat works flawlessly as well and is challenging. There are even some optional upgrades and spells that allow some experimenting on a preferred combat style.
(+) For a soulslike, it has a good story and artistic direction. As one would expect, the story is hard to follow and doesn't even make sense but that is part of the discovery process/art style of these kind of games. I enjoyed it, especially since it focuses on explaining the minimal necessary, without wasting your time with nonsense storytelling. The same is true for the artistic direction: The game is mostly black and grey with some red and yellow here and there. For a short soulslike that is not only sufficient but atmospheric. I didn't feel that more biome were needed, especially since there were different areas, like a forest, castle, underground and castle pathway.
(+) Very fair price. Depending on how skilled one is with these kind of soulsvania games, one should have between 15-25 hours of fun.
(+) There are optional quests and upgrades in the game.
(+) Soundtrack and audio is really good and fits the game/genre well.
(+) The game overall has a good length. Being longer wouldn't make the game better, since it is an indie title with limited gameplay elements. And for these elements, there are no unnecessary parts in this game which would just stretch the content into more hours of playtime.

The only improvements that I could think of:

(-) No dubbing of dialogue. But that is ok, there is not much dialogue anyway.
(-) The last two bosses very significantly harder than all bosses before them. Only a minor annoyance and I could still learn the bosses, it just took longer than what I was used to from the earlier parts of the game.

This game is an example on how games with a limited budget should be made. The focus was on gameplay and art direction that fits well into a reasonable game length and no experimenting in areas where you would need a larger team to deliver an excellent experience. I can only recommend to people who enjoy this soulsvania genre. A relatively short but highly enjoyable 2D metroidvania experience! Whilst not a particularly challenging game, mastering dodge and parry timings really does allow one to play incredibly aggressively, which is something I have always relished in doing (tehe Bloodborne influence). 

In a similar vein, I also enjoyed experiencing the game's intentionally cryptic story. The themes of identity, purpose and what it means to be human shine through the strongest via a multitude of characters ‚Äî each offering their own take on the matter. This was only reinforced when I played through the game for a second time to get 100% achievements, armed with the knowledge granted by the final 1/3 of the game.

This is further complemented by Moonscars' excellent soundtrack, with the stage tracks in particular oozing atmosphere and mood that emphasise the core theming of the overall game. Would highly recommend!

 My eyes are really pleased by this art style, the way animations smoothly blend into each other feels uniquely natural to me
The combat & weapons are fun, looking forward to find more since I haven't finished the game yet
Story is pretty fine until now
Would definitely recommend this one for those who love diving into 2D immersive worlds
 77/100

Art design and  'in-game animations' are so good, with stunning scenery and atmosphere. It's a solid Metroidvania game, though it certainly doesn't qualify as a souls-like.

Could have been much more impressive if they invested more care into the story presentation. Writing and storytelling are mediocre at best. Following the narrative is challenging, and it rarely manages to captivate your interest. While there are a few bright spots in, they either lead nowhere or get abandoned too quickly.

Combat mechanics remain stagnant throughout the game, leaving you with no real sense of progression. You can purchase and use two active skills from a skill tree, but this doesn't add meaningful variety to gameplay. Most skills in the tree feel pointless and lack the appeal needed to encourage players to experiment with different builds.
Map design is inconsistent - brilliantly crafted in some areas while tediously repetitive in others, with some unnecessary sequences clearly added just to pad the game length. Boss encounters are disappointingly few, with only the final two bosses showing truly impressive design while the rest feel generic. Soundtracks are good but unremarkable.

I can only recommend this game to dedicated metroidvania fans who have already played through the genre's standout titles. If you haven't yet experienced games like Hollow Knight or The Messenger and are considering this one, I'd strongly suggest trying those superior titles first. This project was created out of love for the soulslike genre. Short 2D game immediately captivated me with its dark and atmospheric style.  Moonscars utilizes a minimal color palette. A muted range of dark grays accented by red, creating a unique charm. The game's artist drew inspiration from the oil paintings of Old Dutch Masters like Rembrandt.  Each frame of animation was hand-drawn, resulting in highly detailed pixel art.

The protagonist, whom we play as, is Grey Irma. She is a knight of a special order. The game has good combat with an emphasis on parrying. There is standard attack, strong attack, special attack, skill, a dodge roll (dash), amulets, and various buffs. The healing system is quite unique: dealing damage to enemies fills a mana bar, which can then be used for spells or healing. This makes the gameplay dynamic and encourages an aggressive playstyle. Instead of bonfires, there are mirrors; instead of souls, there's bone dust. There are not many bosses, but each one is unique and interesting. Almost everyone has a second phase. Frequent deaths will trigger a Blood Moon, increasing enemy damage ‚Äì a hardcore modifier of sorts. But it can be dispelled using hearts scattered throughout the levels.

Moonscars is about a Lost Soul searching for its creator and the meaning of its own existence in this world. Each death serves as a lesson. We break and rise again, putting ourselves back together piece by piece. It's a story of betrayal, suffering, and revenge; a journey of trials and tribulations to become a great warrior. As Osho said, ""To rise, you must fall; to gain, you must lose.""

I had fun fighting under the moonlight accompanied by atmospheric music. 
It's a shame the project lacked a bit of time and funding.  
I'd give it an 8/10.
 What a special game. I feel lucky to have found Moonscars. It seems not to resonate with everyone, but something about it really sings to me.

To put everything I love about this game into one idea, Moonscars has [i]vision[/i]. 

To be more thorough... the art style and animation are like nothing else I've seen: liquid pixels, like living paint on an ancient screen. The combat is fun, fast, and variable. If you like parrying, this game is a must-play on the strength of its parry alone. The story is beautifully told, full of bold world-building, confident philosophy, deep currents of character-driven love, betrayal, and conflict. The translation can be a little wonky and confusing, but even that works in Moonscars' favor, I think, because it fits alongside the impressionistic visuals and haunting music to present a cohesive, rare experience.

I love this game. I played it through PlayStation's subscription service some years ago, and I'm delighted to have purchased it for Steam Deck. It really should be verified, it runs great and has full controller support. (The default controller layout is really weird though, and I recommend remapping the buttons to your own preference. I basically made it as close as possible to Hollow Knight.)

If you are willing to take this game very seriously ‚Äî to learn its combat, scour its map, and listen closely to its characters ‚Äî you too might find yourself in love with Black Mermaid's strange and moving game. I will be thinking about Grey Irma and her companions for a long, long time. It is a good game. I liked the story and Biblical annotations. At the same time, the game is quite imbalanced closer to the finale. The bosses are much more difficult. If you die and lose your bonuses you gained beating clay dudes, you'll be screwed. To research map was nice. But I think the backstory and more lore is required for each of them. Like in Salt & Sanctuary as an example. Anyways, even though did not like it more than Ender Lillies, I think this project is worth playing as it resembles that one. Moonscars is a hidden gem if I ever found one. Fairly short, but really enjoyable experience. I probably didn't have so much fun with a metroidvania since playing The Last Faith, which was like 5 months ago (I think). Although as mentioned before, this game is much shorter than The Last Faith, or other metroidvania goats like Hollow Knight, Blasphemous or Nine Sols. I would give it solid 9/10

Now if you want more specific information, almost every aspect of this game is really well done
Visuals are probably the best, although I heard some people say it's too bland due to being mostly black and white. I personally found it beautiful, and oddly enchanting that the only colors present are shades of grey, black and white, and red.
Combat in this game is also great, especially bossfights for which they clearly went with quality over quantity. Every single boss was really enjoyable, despite the final boss being kinda underwhelming (which is a running theme in most metroidvanias and soulslikes as I noticed)
Exploration is also great, with every area being filled with breakable walls and other secrets. Also, finding items feels rewarding, and the game never drops junk loot at you
NPCs are pretty well written, and many of them have grown on me, especially the cat
Achievements require almost no grind there is only one collectible achievement (which can be done in like 2 hours if you know what are you looking for), one relatively complicated questline, and either 2 playthroughs or a backup save. I can't say whether it's good or bad, but I like my 100%s being less grindy so I like it
Really only aspect where this game falls a bit behind is the music, which while fitting the atmosphere isn't something I'd listen to outside the game (bear in mind that I listen to video game OSTs on daily basis). Still, I could see myself listening to it while doing something relaxing, or maybe on a foggy night walk",0.11022478922330572

There isn't much interesting to do here unless you happen to be a chimpanzee (literally).  The bird game has kind of a neat aesthetic but even in the 80s it would have been rejected.  If you feel like getting another perspective on computer games (like I did) try it out, but otherwise it's not something for most people. The idea for the game is good. Returns to childhood. This game will appeal more to the adult generation than to children. a strange genre. A lot of text. For fans of xassic text quests . I didn't play much because I didn't quite figure it out and I found it boring. A simple game about the fact that you solve games one after another to find out the hidden truth A lot of different puzzles, I had an interesting time solving various kinds of problems atmospheric Great game to play in the evening.

2419622,Saints Row - A Song of Ice and Dust,dlc,False,"24 Aug, 2023",Action,"When a crippling ambush decimates the Dustlanders, it‚Äôs up to fierce rivals Bossonius and Gwendolyn Firebird to join forces and defend The DustFaire from the Frostlanders, paintball by paintball.","DLC After the events of the Dustmoot and the crowning of King/Queen Bossonius of all the Dustlands, the forces of House Sandy Kraken and House Phoenix are both devastated. In an effort to rebuild strength, the leaders of both Houses must join in LARPing matrimony... But that is quickly threatened as a new threat to all Houses and the DustFaire emerges. The Frostlanders.

A Song of Ice and Dust is Saints Row's third expansion and continues the storyline of one of my favorite parts of the base game, the Dustmoot arc in five new missions set in the Vallejo district of Santo Ileso as well as three new weapons, an assortment of vehicles, cosmetics, a new skill, HQ collectables and more.

Available after finishing the entire Dustmoot arc with ""Unto the Breach"" A Song of Ice and Dust features a well structured and decently lengthy story compared to other DLCs in the Saints Row series, packing it with more fun jokes about LARPs, RPGs and even a dig or two at MMO quest structure and the stereotypical fetch quests within.

Outside of the story however, A Song of Ice and Dust doesn't add anything new to do in the Vallejo district or out in Santo Ileso itself unlike Heist and the Hazardous with the Kaijuice Wingsuit events which does wear down any kind of replayability the content this DLC offers aside from making a new save game.

However as you complete each story mission within A Song of Ice and Dust, you'll be drip fed a multitude of rewards. Looking for some new toys to bring pain to the field of LARP? Try the new Frostlander Axe melee and Frostlander SMG, a fully automatic addition to the Dustlander weapon collection. Want to completely smite your enemies and feel like the LARPing version of Thor? Wield the new Special weapon, the Ban Hammer. Weather you beat enemies with it or throw it and watch it bounce off multiple enemies, this devastating tool gains charge to unleash a shockwave slam attack that deals incredible damage. 

Take to the skies in the new Galitrax helicopter, a Thompson that comes with an assortment of parts to make it look like a dragon. However i'm a little sad that it doesn't come armed with some form of rocket/fireball launcher from the mouth of it. Or if you prefer to keep to the roads, there's the Frost Chariot, an entirely unique model of Palanquin golf-cart that can't be altered to the civilian model. Looking for an armed response? The Frosty Grandad and Sandy Grandad are available, both are variants of the Grandad from the base game that can be stripped down to their civilian appearances, but it won't get rid of the paintball gun turrets mounted on the backs of both the Frosty and Sandy.

Where the store page says that four LARP skills are added, three are given to you to while running the story which are all skills from the base game. The only actual addition is the Frostnade which acts as a new throwable that both damages and slows enemies impacted by the grenade.

On top of all of that are a selection of new customisation options for both the Boss as well as Neenah, Eli and Kev.

If you enjoyed the entire Dustmoot arc with Eli in the base game, you'll get an absolute kick out of this DLC. If you didn't, then you can skip this. But personally? I think this is Saints Row's best DLC and i couldn't recommend it any higher. Alright Who Let Out The D&D Theater Kids Run The Streets For Today? Honestly was quite enjoyable with some quite fun easter eggs here and there. Was one of the first times I started noticing all the easter eggs and references hidden around [spoiler]ELIIIIIII JEEENNNNKKINNNSSS.[/spoiler] Was honestly quite impressed it seemed [i]so[/i] well done despite, I believe, being the last DLC they released followed by shortly after receiving the Axe from Embracer Group. 

Also, brings back in a character that [i]definitely[/i] deserved more screen time in the main story line; [strike]DommyMommy[/strike] I mean Gwen.

Obviously the Larping isn't everyone's cup of tea but, as a nerd, found it quite enjoyable and was very pleased with this addition to the story. Made the Larp in the main story not feel so... Random and out of place.

Rip Volition, didn't deserve to get the Embracer Group curse.
I'll forever miss y'all and will forever enjoy seeing all of y'alls pets included in Radar's Den :luv: This game has already ruined my life, so I'll just eat a spoonful of cinnamon for every like this review gets
 Best DLC in the game. Honestly, I think the story, as short as it was, is better than the main game. Only real complaint I have with it is I wish there was more of it. This DLC is by FAR the best one. You not only get a tonne of unlock-ables including a new weapon, clothing items and a vehicle. The story is extremely fun, as are the missions that pair with it.

If you didn't enjoy the LARP missions in the base-game, you're going to hate this; however if you enjoyed them this takes the gameplay of those missions and improves in every area.

For example, in the LARP missions you couldn't use perks but in this you'll gradually learn 4 of them. Granted, only one of these perks are new and the others are ones from the base game; but they all work perfectly within the rules.

You will also eventually unlock an outfit that looks good! So you can completely ditch the, albeit humorous, cardboard box outfit and use the unlock-able one in it's place; if you're the kinda person who dresses up in LARP gear.

I didn't count how many missions there were, because I was just enjoying the DLC. However I believe there are 5 or 6 missions, each of them are extremely fun and filled to the brim with the LARP-y cringe we've all enjoyed. 

I would HIGHLY recommend this DLC to anyone who enjoyed the LARP stuff in the main game. The price is outstanding for everything you unlock, and the story is a blast. This must be the BEST dlc for Saints Row. It has a lots of interesting cars and storys. This DLC Adds

Classic arcade racing action with split-screen support, a single player story mode packed with 30 tough missions and a cross-country highway with branching routes makes this one of the meanest racers around.","-Weird hover car on ice driving/sliding feel that eventually becomes boring, slow, uneventful gameplay once you get used to it.
-Car sometimes 360 spins in place when hitting other cars.
-No options whatsoever, no way to change controls. Only manual gears. No Pause button.
-Lengthy fade in/out between menu screens. 
-Speedometer/Gears display on left side instead of right like in every other racing game. 
-Unknown save file location in case you want to save unlocks and progress for future use or between PCs.
-Pointless annoying tune plays after every checkpoint which makes it sound like there's music fading in and out constantly. 
-Linear career mode were you'll get stuck on the dumb and annoying mini-games such as the road being invisible or hitting enough snowmen before time runs out instead of actual racing. Reminds me a lot of Hot Wheels: Stunt Track Challenge for the GBA which is one of my favorite styles for racers lol so if you like that game you will ADORE this game! Visually, WR95 is somewhat similar to Virtua Racing Deluxe on 32X. I wouldn't say it plays anywhere near as well as that game, but the driving mechanics are still decent. Collision penalties are the biggest issue right now, but the developer has promised to improve that aspect of the game in a later update. All-in-all, it's a nice little throwback arcade racer with a very palatable price tag.

Update: Collision penalties have been reduced. No more spinning out upon any contact whatsoever. A game where you can't find where the controls are, except you try all keys of your keyboard but then the race is over cause it's time restricted.
Very frustrating and completely lame the dev hasn't included the control layout or keys so you can play without being so frustrating the first second.
Also the drive controls are something very anoying cause when you hit an opponent your car spins around so you lose a lot of time.
The graphics are ok for a '95 game (almost as good as the first Nascar Racing game from 1994, no wait almost as good as stunt driver from 1990.

So it's a big NO for me, sorry ! Fun so far. Love the aesthetic! Though I wish this game had achievements... Also, the generic wreck physics are... frustrating. I agree with the other guy, this game is really good for the price. A great game for its small price !",-0.04433699633699633
405810,Valzar,game,False,"22 Dec, 2015","Action, Adventure, Indie",Explore an uncharted land and recover the pieces of a broken amulet. Valzar is a tough arena action platformer with roguelike elements.,"This game has mostly solid stylized art, intereting ideas and a solid concept, but the game almost completely misses the mark.  It's not terrible, but I believe that at 10 dollars it is a waste of money.  Wait for a sale or something.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdBfAytZSzc

This game is a combination of action platforming and roguelite.  Being a fan of roguelites I was excited to get my hands on this game, as the art style looked really cool, but it falls short in so many areas that make it hard to recommend.

First, platforming is paramount in this game.  That's perfectly fine, as I loved Risk of Rain and platforming is very important there, too.  However, Valzar's controls are sluggish at best.  You feel as though you're walking in molasses which makes traversing through the environment an absolute chore.  The worst part is that you have to trek your butt back to the exit door at the end of each room, and when you find yourself at the bottom of a pit having killed the last enemy, you curse the fact that you have to painstakingly climb your way up with the slow and clumsy movement.

Second, the combat, while initially fine, quickly devolves into chaos with unavoidable damage.  You move in molasses while your enemies fly toward you.  I've had enemies get knocked up then track me perfectly as they fall.  I've had enemies shoot endless strings of homing bullets that move faster than me.  I've been hit by so many things that I couldn't really understand than I could count.  Combat in these games is supposed to be fun, but in Valzar it is a chore.  A barrier in your way that you have to chip at for 2 billion years through many lives.  It could drive a man mad.

Third, the game seems indecisive on what it feels like it needs to explain, mechanics-wise.  For the most part it's okay, but there's moments when you have to make a choice to keep your spells as they are or or replace it with something else.  You can test it out there, but sometimes the text is ridiculously vague, leaving you to make a blind choice.  You can always go back to the room, but that wastes valuable resources and time, forcing you to enter each room (rooms are moved to from a world map in a adjacent tile kind of system) even if you've already cleared it.

Finally, on the nitpicky side, the UI and control scheme is just awkward.  The START button on the controller is unmapped, but Left Bumper opens the inventory.  What?!

Valzar's ideas are there, but the execution falls way short in the most important categories.  Unless there's massive patches to combat unavoidable damage or make platforming less infuriating, this game will be little more than frustrating. It's like developer's just assume proc gen makes a fun game.  This is nothing like Rogue Legacy as a few people claim it seems like.  Rogue Legacy was fun to bash monsters in.   This, is a complete mess.  Controls when attacking monsters are a mess.  You will get hit most of the time attacking anything because your just a small group of pixels running into another group of pixels with a pathetic weapon.  The spells really don't explain what they do.  There are barely any gear drops early on from what I saw.  The appearance of the game coupled with the simplistic gameplay is NOT worth 10 bucks imo.  The whole game just screams simplicity.  The dev probably thought, ""I'll throw procedural generation and the term roguelike on there and people will buy it.""  He was right. Really nice background art but the characters are really simple and lacking.  Really they look like the most basic pixel art you can imagine.  Animations are ok.  The platforming controls are ok for the most part but it's hard to control your jump height.  The level design isn't very thought out.  Obviously its randomly generated so that may be part of the problem.  It's also very frustrating when you die from an unavoidable hit and then you have to start ALLLLL over. This game is really good. Scratches that ""Risk of Rain"" itch really well. The spells, classes, auras, companions and weapons are all swapable and change the play style. The difficulty cure is spot on.  The mood and setting are also really compelling. It's hard to recommend a game like this after playing Rogue Legacy.  Both games are sidescrolling roguelikes but this one seems to be much more centered around upgrades and loot while the gameplay and controls are really lacking.  I really like the art style and I'm having fun but the game just isn't grabbing me the way games like Nuclear THrone and Binding of Isaaac do.",0.03892513736263736

This is a pretty cool soundtrack overall. It‚Äôs 26 tracks, clocking in at around 44 minutes, and the quality is consistently high across the board. There‚Äôs a nice variety here too: some softer, ambient tracks that lean peaceful and atmospheric, and others that are full-blown, high-octane combat instrumentals. Each song sounds impressive and cinematic.
That said, while it's [i]good[/i], that cinematic nature is a bit of a double-edged sword. On one hand, it makes the music feel epic and polished. On the other hand, it‚Äôs not exactly the kind of music most people would throw on in the background while browsing the steam store or just hanging out. It feels like it‚Äôs always building to or accompanying something big, which is awesome in-game, but less versatile, and slightly off-putting at times, outside of it.
So do I recommend this soundtrack? Yes, but probably not at the full $8 price. It goes on sale [i]all the time[/i] for under $2, and at THAT price, it's definitely worth picking up. Even if it doesn‚Äôt become your most-played OST, the quality alone justifies making it an addition to your collection. My opinion on the soundtrack: its good, and captures the idea of the game.

I've played 3 games of this same developer and there's still no change to the UI, progression system and tech tree. I respect this guy's consistency of using the same mediocre tech tree all the time. This makes the player feel like the dev is neglecting the playerbase and only sees them as dumbass money makers. I didn't look at the developer before buying, so my first reaction when I opened the game was ""Oh not again."". This taught me a lesson, which I need to take a look at who developed the game and if it's tbjbu2 stay away from that game. I'm not trying to undermine the dev, but he needs to give much more effort to the games he's making. 

To summerize, I don't recommend this game or any other game of this developer until he gives decent effort on his games. Have a nice day.

Edit: I refunded this game successfully. I LOVE this game. I play games to have fun. I am not an engineer. I own Dyson, Satisfactory and Stationeers, and find this game a refreshing change. I love the simplicity of the user interface, the bright colours, the feeling of accomplishment as I create Dyson rings, and now a moon. I can fly to the moon on my spaceship (which I also created), and harvest resources from the moon. I see that planets will also be created. Eventually I will also have a whole solar system. I am tired of games where stamina is always depleted, thirst kills you, etc. etc. In this game there is no stamina or thirst, just hunger. Also the setup allows you to change the rates of hunger, resource gathering, etc. So far I haven't learned how to create a base, I hope that will be possible. I learned pillars but don't know what to do with them. I see that there are farm plots in the tech tree so I will be able to grow my own food in the future. I would like to see two things that I have not seen yet in the game. The first is an easy way to build neat sloping paths into the underground. As the game is voxel based, I can mine, lower the levels of terrain, raise the level of terrain, and flatten the terrain. However, I haven't yet been able to make a neat sloping pathway. The second thing is that I like to build a base to store my equipment. I don't want my machinery sitting on the grass. I hope this will be possible. Overall however, I really think this game is wonderful for someone like me who loves the idea of reasonably easy survival (although you can crank up the difficulty), no stamina issues, a voxel based system, the ability to create a whole solar system in time, etc. etc. Sorry, but it's a trash knock-off of Dyson Sphere Program... No actual longevity play-ability. i feel i got my monies worth Ladies and Gentlemen. Welcome to Karagon 4.0, you can just look in the files and the .exe is called Karagon. This ""indie developer"" claims people like me are the reason indie games are dying, when in fact he's the reason indie games are dying. Just flooding Steam with asset flips to make a quick buck....er I mean not this ""developer"" he doesn't need your pathetic amount of money since he's now rich with crypto. Probably all thanks to Trump as well. 

Now yes, I did only play this game for 1 minute. Steam says 0.1 hrs, but that's being generous. In reality, I only need 1 minute to realize that this is just Karagon, er I mean Grand Emprise, er I mean World Crafter TD. er I mean Star Crafter. The exact same assets, exact same layout, exact same slop.

Now, you're probably wondering why I decided to spend $30 of my cold hard cash and give it to some twat like this ""developer"". Well it's because I wanted to go out of my way and give this game a negative review because why not. It's an asset flip, it doesn't deserve a single ounce of praise. Now im not saying indie developers unlike this guy is allowed to use assets from the marketplace to make their game. You can but to use the exact same ones for the fifth game in a year in a row? Really shows the kind of circus this ""developer"" is living in.

Now, I know this guy is gonna leave a comment and be all aggresive and say some mean shit. Oh shimber me timbers. But truth be told, no one loves you, it's a fact. And for the people who fallen for this crap and will ""harass"" me. Save your soul not for me, or if you even got one that is. I know the ""developer"" doesn't.

Well anyway, enjoy your slop, enjoy your depressing life. There's lots of evidence of each game being abandoned for two reasons. 

1. Game is 100% complete (Which it really isn't)
2. No one wants to play this game anymore because it's crap. It is seriously flawed, I remapped  movement keys to the arrow keys and the work in the opposite direction, graphics are horrible in full screen, this is more a demo (and a bad one at that) than a full release. Great game. Has major potential. It's like a simplified dyson sphere. Lots of fun, hope they add co-op keep developing Good game For being in early access, the game plays well. There are many QoL things that are missing that would normally be expected from this type of game. I do have concerns with the asset similarity to other games released in rapid succession, but I will wait to see if the dev listens to the community with their next update.

Can you stay together until the end?","i really like this game, it's defininetly worth buying if it's on sale.
Amy is really relatable, her relationship with Hugh is my favorite one
all the routes are fun to play and discover the different endings (one ending in particular... i was shook lol)
i highly recommend playing the first game before playing this one
unfortunately the achievements are not really syncing with Steam and this is the only thing annoying me about this game :'( This game is about couples that shouldn't have married.

Everyone is trash people in Hugh's route (including MC and Hugh) and his plotline makes me wanna puke.
Everyone is painfully insecure and incapable of communicating in Aaron route.
Eddy's plotline just makes me angry.
Lawrence deserved better. Better plotline, better parents and better wife. Also, Eddy is such a prick in this route.

And why literally every woman except MC is an enemy? Even MC's friends portrayed as villains - they want you to get divorce after all. And Bechdel test? Don't know her. It's kind of...misogynistic? 

Honestly, I just feel dirty and exhausted after reading this vn. If you played the first game and enjoyed it, I would generally recommend skipping playing this one. Instead turning to your own imagination or the fan fictions out there if you want to see more these characters and their stories. You will probably be happier that way. 

The first game left a lot of things left up in the air with the writing, but the sequel does so more. You are forced to make many decisions on things you MIGHT have saw or read about in game but most likely haven't. Like many other games where players get to make decisions with a voiceless MC, it can be difficult to make the decision you meant to. Since we regularly don't know the tone the FMC will take until we commit. 

Gameplay isn't about blind faith, trust, and putting other characters first all the time, this isn't a criticism just a statement. Probably a good sprinkle of reality for the players of this game who are newer to such relationships. Much of it is about the FMC speaking about her own needs, which seems to be a valuable lesson for a lot people. People who tend to switch into people pleaser mode with the people they care about. Relationships are a two way street.  

Overall, I found this sequel pretty cynical and depressing for a sequel to an otome game...Despite what it may or may not teach the players about. When playing this game, you should assume that if you, as the player, don't have the FMC talk about certain issues in the moment that they are not discussed in unseen moments when it may be more appropriate and productive to have those conversations. Which is something I don't particularly love about many VNs, the whole not having a proper discussion at a better time thing (as it is rather unrealistic storytelling wise), not important things happening behind the scenes thing. }}

The new game mechanic takes some getting used to. But it is fine. I preferred the game mechanic from the first game. While it does feel like there is more writing in this game than there was in the first, other areas were a bit of a let down. Unless you play in VN mode, you spend about half of the game looking at a boring screen rather than art. TLDR; I do NOT recommend. In every story either the MC is terrible and/or the guy is terrible. Lawrence's story is the only one that didn't leave a terrible taste in my mouth. So if you absolutely must play one just choose Lawrence and skip the rest, thank me later.
Maybe the stories were meant to be more realistic but if that's real I want NO part of it.
Think assault, possible roofies, infidelity. And that's just one story! 
[spoiler]2 stories have affairs, 1 has messed up priorities, and one has mother issues.[/spoiler]
Lawrence is still my favorite but his story had the least number of catastrophic relationship issues.
Honestly, I only finished it because I try to have 100% achievements. I really enjoyed this game. The main character comes across as very human. Her job varies depends on who she's married to and the various issues vary. All of the stories are interesting. 

I didn't play the stat building part of the game, just the straight up visual novel so I can't comment on that. Had fun with this game, wish the game play was more like the first game tho BIG CW for sexual assault and romanticized sexual violence.

There's a lot of exciting ideas in this game's blurb: the very notion of vn/dating sim sequel that focuses on an established relationship makes me tingly all over. But I'm not sure what I really expected beyond that.

There's the obvious sexism and the barebones gameplay. There's the sense that I've been tricked into playing a game based on a presumed attachment I had to Always Remember Me. There's the inconsistent art style and the bizarre characterization of--everyone. It's really hard to find something positive to say about this game right now and I think a lot of my troubles can be summarized by the Hugh route, where Amy is literally assaulted by Luis but the route takes pains to make it seem like...................that's a good thing? She enjoys being sexually harassed because she feels neglected? What am I supposed to make of this? If I'm feeling totally crazy I can maybe throw some darts at a board and come up with an argument that says something like ""Uhhhhhhh...........Amy's dealing with her severe self-esteem issues while working in an industry that puts bodies on display like so much cattle so here's a thinly veiled takedown of a fantastical representation of said industry and uhhhhh there's some internalized misogyny that makes her feel like potentially getting roofied could be a romantic come on........and uh..............................the floss-thin connections between scenes are really just phenomenological representations of her sense of her alienation from her marriage????""

I don't know. Sounds like hooey. Sounds like excuse-making for a game that really wants me to be like ""wow good on Hugh for NOT blaming the victim"" just as the internal narration is explicitly like ""uwu wow assault makes me feel so good this must be a secret wish of mine how exciting to be ~desired~"". This is a great example of why the current vn renaissance is so important: this kind of BS shouldn't be the norm anymore.

Honestly, what the hell is this. This game doesn't seem to know what it wants to be . Or, maybe, this game knows exactly what it is: a good idea dressed up with flimsy streamers to convince someone to waste their money on it. Do yourself a favour: if you feel even just NEUTRAL toward Always Remember ME and are like ""damn I'd love to see where these bizarre-o relationships go"", write yourself some fanfiction. You as a player are infinitely more capable of showing more respect to these characters than Winter Wolves did. For those who don't belive in ""Happy ever after. The end"".  Game about that ""Your happily ever after"" needs a lot of hard work.  In this dating sim you play the married couple life. Will you stay married or divorce?

+You can choose between visual novel version and raising stats.
+Not too long for those who don't have much time for visual novel.

-Great graphic difference between characters from First Game and Second one.
-Too short for those who likes complicate stories. Just a nice way to kill time and enjoy the story laid out before you. A little tedious on the weeks screen but otherwise I really liked playing this game. The soundtrack is lovely. And it's a lot better than Always Rememer Me.

Rough around the edges but interesting narrative - didn‚Äôt expect this from the dev of those mobile troll games I‚Äôve played in the past Short game, takes about 1 hour to finish. A realistic story about life itself. Amazing little adventure where it explains the life of different people in 4 different chapters. I read a comment that explains about the game being about the developer's life. Really interesting hope he will have all the success in more games to come. Thanks for this amazing journey.

I just wish it has a bit more content. Still recommended. depressing but somehow uplifting. a great experience DepressionCore
 Nope. If your game is hideously boring and not intuitive, make a way for users to skip steps. Don't force them to do monotonous things. Another Adventure, maybe not!

498680,In The Shadow Of The Truth,game,False,"17 Oct, 2016","Adventure, Indie","First person shooter,puzzle,psychological horror video game. by 7TPGAMES","This game has potential, but nix the murderous, running a-hole with the shovel, please.  I had to ditch him in the swingset several times and he was right on my 'a', so it was difficult.  Also, make the batteries easier to pick up and the flashlight last longer.  An english-fluent editor would help.  I generally hate games that do not have the ability to save anywhere/anytime, but this one is short.  The video walkthrough is about 22 minutes to complete the game.

It is a dark and rainy and has a few pop-out type scary moments.  If I did not have two walkthroughs to guide me, I would have hated this game because I would have had to restart it from the beginning many times due to the a-hole mentioned above. It's ok for one buck in a sale. Alright. I've played for.. A couple hours now apparently. The game is poor in my opinion, sadly as I wanted to give it a fair go. The puzzles are obscure, with no real hints as to where you are supposed to look for information, I solved the second one completely on accident, the third I literally started spam clicking after wasting half of my battery, and the fourth one took most of an hour wandering around to get. 
The puzzles require somewhat random trivia know,  and only for the first do you get any aid as to the solution. 
Language wise, it is clear that the developer doesn't speak English primarily, but also clear that they didn't have the help of an English speaker to translate, but instead seemed to rely on dictionary translations. 
The enemy I encountered in my time playing was also very poor. There is a somewhat jarring cut scene, which leads to you being attacked by a random guy for no discernable reason. However, it is -very- easy to hang the AI up on pathing issues, and I eventually got fed up with trying to solve the puzzle with him chasing me so I stuck him on the swings in the playground and left him to rot. 
The game has promise, but it definitely needs help and polish. *subject to revision if I can ever get out of the first damn room.

- The build on the english store boots in Turkish

- You can't pick up the glowing red keys on the table at the start because the light isn't turned on (there is also a glowing red bottle on the desk which I can't pick up yet & an achievement for getting 5 batteries so I'm guessing this is going to be one of those games that won't let you pick up anything until the game wants you to, not necesarily when a player would find it on a natural playing path).
Also, you click into notes & inspect objects with LMB but you have to press ESC to back out of them, which is annoying.

- The notes are in Turkish, there is broken english subtitles, but only the first time you open a note or click into a 'zoom' event like the computer password.

- I tried all the text in the room that would fit into the computer password screen & nothing worked; don't know if it is broken or if one of the notes is a puzzle written in Turkish.

- The whiteboard in the office has a bunch of code on it, I don't know if that is a puzzle or it is literally an odd bug; who knows with this so far.

It could be good, I don't know, maybe I'll never know.
I kind of half want to recommend it so that someone might tell me the password so I can leave the first room; until then, no.",-0.032323129251700666

871230,Dungeon Rush,game,False,"8 Aug, 2018","Action, Adventure",Dungeon Rush is an absolutely beautiful and colorful fantasy bow VR shooting game where you have to protect your castle from hordes of undead warriors.,"Cool tower defender VR game.

7.5/10 No, is not great. Early VR implementation and not a great amount of content. It's a great solo game. It looks good to me. It has campaign and survival modes, 4 different bows and no story whatsoever. For 4$ it's a great buy. Fun game but the only problem i have with it is that your firing trigger stays the some when you change hands, your firing trigger should change bast on what hand your holding the arrow, or even better put in a setting where we can chose there the firing trigger is and where we want to hold the bow and arrow, other was its confusing. While the game is solidly made, the wave shooter scenario where you stand at a fixed point get old really fast. Couldn't play it longer than a few minutes before becoming bored.

Not recommended. I liked the minimalistic design and how it doesn't try to distract you with non-interactive clutter. It's sorely lacking in more levels and variability within/between levels, where map 1 felt too small and map 4 and 5 were too big that it was too hard to get the arrows far enough to hit the enemies. The patterns are the same between levels, so round 1 is always middle lane, round 6 is always ranged only, etc. Encountered a bug I couldn't reproduce after restarting the game - the trigger to load and release arrows got switched to the bow hand, which was hilarious, but couldn't fix in game without shutting my VR down completely and restarting. Allowing you to physically move away and dodge enemies projectiles was a brilliant touch. Critically, though, the bow upgrades gives you essentially the same effect in three different colors, so that was also a little lackluster. 

I also love how cute the skeletons are and how they give you your personal space even when they surround and attack you.

Overall, I got it on 40% off at 5.39 CDN, it doesn't give me motion sickness like some other titles, and the controls were intuitive, so an easy 7/10. One points off each for - could use more campaign levels or adding a mini plot for why you're defending these areas, missing level editor/mods compatibility for replayability, and definitely could have done a little something more for the bow upgrades (I.e. shoot further, increase projectiles, add more effect to arrows, etc). If the devs are actively working on this title, they could easily bring it up to an incredible wave defence game worth two or three times as much as they charge now. 8 / 10

This is a fun wave shooter. Much better than a lot of the other wave shooters out there. I recommend this. DO NOT GET WITH MIXED REALITY HEADSET

Since the games entire concept is to fire a bow which requires placing your hand outside of the effective tracking area it really doesnt work.  The concept is definitely fun but without the aid of a push to shoot or a pullback requirement slider (so you could shoot full strength with a unrealistically short pull) it really doesnt work.  I wouid love to experience more of the game as the concept is amazingly fun but without a htc vibe it isnt really playable.

Other ways to resolve could include conventional difficulty settings, pullback strength indicator (so you can establish consisency with a unnatural 3/4 pull) or aim crosshair.  When the pullback hand exits the field of view it is considered static resulting is incorrect vector calculations for aim since the near hand position cannot be accurately determined. This is a fun game. The graphic style for levels and characters is fun and bright. The waves of enemies are well programmed and by the 8th wave things are busy. The archery mechanics are good and sound effects are good too.

623930,Solaria Moon,game,False,"6 Sep, 2017","Adventure, Indie",Solaria Moon is a space adventure in 3D with an outstanding script full of challenging puzzles to solve and mysteries to uncover.,"This is a short, mediocre and unoptimized 3D indie adventure game with tedious and repetitive puzzles, bad controls, and bad voice acting in a spaceship setting. You play a young female computer engineer who woke up from hybernation because of a malfunction in the spaceship, and she decided to find out what is going on with the ship in which one of your crewmates has disappeared and two of them are deceased. story sounds like bad Alien-inspired fan fiction, and the game feels also really low budget, and my patience ran out after two hours, and I decided to uninstall this game. Bad controls, Boring and insipid. Very basic puzzle/adventure game. Graphics & story mediocre; the characters were poorly-developed and two-dimensional. Puzzles OK but mostly tedious, math- or sequence-based puzzles. You can beat this game in an hour or two, tops. Game is short.

Voice acting is bad.
 
The puzzles are stupid, nonsensical and feel out of place in a spaceship environment.

The game camera is annoyingly jumpy

Pass. Not recommended, only for the die hard sci-fi adventure game fans imo.

I will start by saying that the game has some good moments, I managed to play it through and liked some of what the devs made here, but overall it was a letdown. The biggest selling points are the graphics, standard sci-fi setting and the low price. The game play, controls, short length and a few bugs here and there were the biggest downfalls. It just didn't feel clean and I sort of forced my way through until the end. Left/right controls turn the camera instead of strafing.
Some puzzles are too easy.  Some are too hard in the sense that there is a large number of possible combinations and I could not find a deduction path.  I had to either resort to randomly hitting buttons or even to do some Python programming to find the solutions. Attractive space feeling, unrealistic, but a nice and relaxing playthrue to my likes. Short, amateur, just a trivial space mystery story, without lore or history depth. 

The wriddles are based of a handful of repeated grid technics, and they have no logical connection with the environment or story, but thats OK for me regarding I treated the game as a 'relaxing casual break' of my main gaming endenvours of the time. The wriddles do challenge a bit the gamer intelligence, but after using pen and paper to structure down the logic of even the harder ones, they pose no threat any more. It feels like inteligence and creativity is less usefull than organised observation of the pazzle patterns to finally solve the matrix. In any case, they wriddles were interesting enouph to keep me playing the game. But regardless the short duration of the game, if a x3 expansion was relesased with the same logic of pazzles, I feel I would got bored of them.

Not a bad game, but since there is no 'middle grade' in STEAM, I will not recommend this since I feel it is too short for its original money price. Nice effort from the development team, but I believe there are other better amateur adventures out there. If you look for a casual space short episode, purchase Solaria Moon when on sales. But the few evenings gameplay cannot compete with other 10euro projects that offer moth-long entertaintment. It`s not a perfect game, but very enjoyable.

You wake up from hibernation in a space station. some of the crew died, one fled before you woke up. The game happens inside the station and while you investigate what happened to the programmed hibernation to fail you start to discover there might be a strange reason behind all that`s happening.

I found the game quite enjoyable: reasonable grapichs, relaxing music that matches the overall ""isolated in space"" atmosphere the game wants to convey, a lot of puzzles. The game is quite short (although worth the price you pay for) and the story let me down near the end. Some people might like it better than I did.

I also liked that when the character speaks there is a little portrait like a spaceship log, and the main character's voice is really well dubbed. You can't say that about the other crew members, but it doesn't take you away from the immersion.

Give it a go, it's well worth it. I rather liked Solaria moon. It's a modest game to be sure, and to enjoy it, it's good to come with modest expectations. This indie space adventure does a good job recreating the kind of bright and sterile sci-fi interiors, reminiscent of Star Trek or 2001: A Space Odyssey, and for me, this already puts things in the right atmosphere. The puzzles are focused not so much on inventory manipulation as on pulling levers and pushing buttons in the right sequence, sliding tiles around etc. I'm usually not a big fan of these, but they were well done in this game, and mostly not too hard. All in all, it took me 3 hours to play through this game and for the 99 cents I paid on sale, I consider that decent. For the full price, though, (currently $9.99), this game might underwhelm. It took 10 minutes for me to ragequit. I don't think a game has ever pissed me off this fast. This review gets a little salty, but rest assured that I'm not exaggerating. This game is bad.

First off, the protagonist is a psychopath. Her peers literally die during a catastrophe (a retarded one, mind you--the system has an error and reboots, and somehow a measly minute off of life support is enough to kill everyone, even though they could easily be woken up and immediately ready to walk), and her reaction is to monologue about it out loud, to nobody (talking to herself), in a monotone voice that conveys zero emotion. Hey, you know what? I tend to think aloud too, but at least my reaction to someone's death isn't casually stating the obvious for absolutely nobody to hear and then moving on without even taking a moment of silence to let the situation sink in. Aside from the horrible voice acting, that is just not an appropriate response at all, when your peers died and you narrowly survived. Casually stating ""they are dead because of a system error and the other guy is missing"" (which by the way, was ALREADY CONVEYED BY THE CUTSCENE BEFORE THAT! Show, don't tell) is not what a human being's reaction would be. A human being's reaction to that situation is ""OH FUCK EVERYBODY'S DEAD AND I ALMOST DIED AND I'M ALONE, THIS IS HORRIBLE"". is this character even fucking human?

After that, I was tasked with picking up clothes, something that our lone protagonist who is completely alone in the ship should not even care about, and yet she was so insistent on getting clothes that I couldn't do anything else until I looked at virtually everything in the room before finding the stupid locker where her clothes were. Why? What is the point of this? Why not just make that a cutscene?

After that, the game ended, because the only way forward is to solve a tedious rubix-cube-like puzzle that's not fun or interesting whatsoever, and I cannot will myself to spend any more time trying to sort the pieces in order. And what does this even have to do with the game? For a 3D game with FPS controls (and ugly troll doll-looking characters who don't act like human beings and can't voice act to save their lives), a random puzzle doesn't make sense.

Okay, so apparently this is a puzzle game. At least partly. Probably something like the witness. But the puzzles are garbage and un-fun, so that's actually worse. What the witness gets right that this game gets wrong is that the puzzles, while difficult, are actually *interesting*. A puzzle-piece swapper that is somehow the security authentication system for deactivating the sleeper pods to already-dead characters and plays like a rubix cube is NEITHER interesting nor fun. It's actually aggravating because what the hell is the purpose of shutting off life support when the goal is to escape the room? There's nothing else to do in the room, so that puzzle must be the way forward, and yet I don't understand why I'm doing it. Not only is this puzzle--the FIRST PUZZLE--too difficult to solve in a timely manner (give me a break, I suck at rubix cubes), but my efforts in trying to solve it feel pointless.

And that clusterfuck is just the first couple minutes. I know I only played that couple of minutes, but you have to understand that first impressions are everything, and this game sets a very bad one. People say you can't judge a book by its cover, but in reality, 99% of the time, you can. Crap is easier to spot given experience. And boy, is this game ever a trainwreck.

Oh, also the controls are bad, apparently. I wasn't paying attention to that because I was busy having my mind blown by everything else that was awful about the game. Had I stuck around long enough to experience the A/D-turning-instead-of-strafing everyone else is talking about, I would be complaining about that, too. As you can see, I only scratched the surface of this abomination.

It's almost like in my 10 minutes of playtime, I tested the game more thoroughly than the devs/QA team did. You know that one guy in the QA team? The guy who nags you on a daily basis about how your puzzles are poorly designed and the tasks don't make sense? Polish this, bugfix that? You should have listened to that guy.

I don't really have any comments on the other aspects of the games. The music is clearly unmemorable because I don't remember any music, and the graphics are whatever. As I said in an aside somewhere above, the characters are ugly troll-doll-looking things. And I say that because just look at the hair-do on the protag.

Contains over 10 advanced missions designed for elite soldiers. That long-awaited creepy-crawly enemy that EDF enlistees were waiting for is finally here.,"I bought this DLC quite awhile ago and I only just got around to finishing it. While short (clocking in at only 11 missions), this mission pack offers some of the most solid missions in the whole game. It's also nice that they went ahead and threw some new weapons in this DLC as well. If you enjoyed the main game, you'll enjoy this. The new weapons from this DLC are pretty neat (having Lionic missiles that are beacon-guided rather than laser-guided is sweet). I'm honestly not sold on most of the missions, I don't think they add much to the game (other than being higher difficulty), but the final two (of 11) are just total chaos, in the best way possible. If you thought the base game was easy and had no challenge then this mission pack is like getting hit with a wet towel from behind in a gym's locker room. Get it if you want a real challenge As with all EDF games, it's usually a good bet to buy the extra mission packs. 

This extra mission pack features its own self contained story, and the ability to find weapon packs hidden throughout the DLC specific levels along with characters. While no new characters are added to the roster, all the new weapons introduced are a real joy to play around with. 

The DLC also adds a new difficulty level, which may as well be called 'Get ready to load up your underwear' mode because man its a nightmare. Add on to the fact that these new 11 levels are more challenging than anything you've seen in the base game and also include some real explosive banger moments that will have you cheering, especially if you're playing with friends. 

An absolute solid buy. More of virtually the same. Don't be fooled by the weapons crates; they don't drop and are essentially the same as rescuing a member, but without the chance you'll obtain a new accessory.

The variety of items, enemies, characters, and passive skills along with just how much was taken into account with how they interact and how often you'll be surprised to see them do new things you've never seen before even many hours in really makes this something you'll find yourself coming back to frequently.

Its early access state means it's quite buggy and incomplete but there's still a lot of fun to be had even in its current state. It's a Roguelite top-down game with solid physics and an interesting mechanic where you can 'infuse' items with other items which grant it specific bonuses. You unlock more slots for these infusions the more bosses you defeat, and there's strategy (and some luck) involved with buildcrafting due to the card and infusion system. You can also curse items to purify them which has a chance to grant them lesser/greater enchantments as well as unique enchantments for specific items, such as a rock getting the Myriad enchantment which lets me indulge in my caveman fantasy of just throwing rocks at everything because now you throw infinite shadow rocks at people. There's also a lot of potential for co-op shenanigans where you and your buddy can cooperate to complement each other's builds.

All in all, great game, has rough edges due to being early access but it has amazingly solid ideas and a dev who actually cares about it. Plays pretty great in co-op too! Great foundation for a really solid co-op game!! The physics and systems are really slick and movement feels great. Not a vast amount of content available yet, but there are semi-regular patches.
Solo play has a bit of a steep learning curve, expect to die a lot on level 1, get the hang of it, and then rarely drop a run afterwards. Co-op mitigates this with a generous respawn system, but you may find yourself dying to the sheer chaos. Feels like a mix of Spiral Knights and Spelunky.
If you feel like adding a promising project to your library and supporting a small dev, give this one a shot! Fun and relatively unknown game In my opinion, a stunningly beautiful and immensely enjoyable game. 

Think 3D Spelunky with lots of verticality and fun ways of moving forward with leveling, gear and skills. But that much is an underestimation. Gatedelvers definitely has its own unique and undeniably captivating charm. You can easily tell that it was crafted with love.

3/10 Wouldn't buy again Its buggy. Game play is stale. Hasn't received an update since 2019. Do not buy. Stay Away. Garbage. Dumpster Fire. Swamp Water. You get the point. nice game :^) Finally, some good fricking food

But the game has no player's and there have been no updates . "" Animals > Humans "" - A random vegan Easy to see why it is still in BETA. Characters turn and move really slowly which makes the game feel clunky, and would make things too chaotic on a tv with 8 people. 
Hoping they clean this game up, would be great as a party game. 
Wait until final release before buying. it be sweg

 Too buggy to be playable. Couldent get any of the modes to work properly with no enemy spawning and no control of the players",-0.032608695652173905
1943460,Holiday Jigsaw Easter 3,game,False,"10 Apr, 2022",Casual,Holiday Jigsaw. Easter 3: 500 holiday photos will provide many memorable experiences this year!,"""Holiday Jigsaw Easter 3"" is a basic browser/Flash/mobile-app like jigsaw puzzle game.  Solve various jigsaw puzzles made up from images that the ""developer"" stole off the Internet and used without crediting the actual creators, making this plagiarism, as well as an asset flip and a cash grab.

An example of the stolen, uncredited/plagiarised artwork is [url=https://www.123rf.com/photo_17726116_colorful-flowers-decoration-with-blue-wall-background.html]""Colourful Flowers Decoration With Blue Wall Background""[/url], stolen and used without any apparent permissions or rights from the photographer, ""Tul"" via stock image site, 123RF.  Sure, the image rights may allow some stock images to be used without credit (although there's no reason to believe so in this case), and claiming credit for the work of others, as is happening here, is unethical, and the creative and intellectual bankruptcy going on here is unacceptable.

So what we have here is a basic jigsaw puzzle engine that's been skinned with a bunch of photos stolen off the internet and used without attribution.  The icing on the cake is the ""developer"" here has copy + pasted + reskinned this same asset onto Steam [i]a lot[/i]. 

The developer, Creobit/8Floor, has copy + pasted this game an insane SEVENTY SIX TIMES onto Steam with minor reskins... why cash in on one asset if you can cash in on multiple copies of the same game? Asset flipping begins at home! Here's a list of Creobit's copy + pastes of this asset:

[i]These are all reskins of exactly the same game![/i]  What value is there in this spam/pollution glutting the Steam store for gamers?

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics. 

This looks and feels like a mobile app, but it doesn't seem to have made it to the app stores.  It's unclear why this was put on Steam instead of the app stores it seems to have been designed for.  Maybe it was removed, maybe it was rejected by Apple and Google (they do have more rigorous quality standards than Valve does for Steam, after all).

Regardless, for all intents and purposes this might as well be a mobile app, it has the same limitations and dumbed down qualities.  It's impossible to recommend such a game to PC gamers.  We don't spend all this money building gaming rigs so we can pretend they're iPhones and play games that might as well be mobile apps.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 2 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

""Holiday Jigsaw Easter 3"" has the farcical price of around $5 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam.",0.022176213480561313

Now you too can explore an unfamiliar and hypnotic genre mash-up wherein dubstep and chipmusic flirt with, and intoxicate your senses.",":( BIT.TRIP.FATE Soundtrack is the soundtrack to BIT.TRIP FATE, the fifth game in the BIT.TRIP series. It can be sampled prior to purchase at the developer's Bandcamp page: http://gaijingames.bandcamp.com/album/bit-trip-fate-original-soundtrack

Unlike the other BIT.TRIP games, FATE's soundtrack is less intrinsically tied to the player action, so the songs work a little better outside of the game environment. It's a fine, if short, soundtrack.

Similar to the other BIT.TRIP soundtracks, half of the tracks are very short - the noises for completing or failing a level, etc, so there's only five ""full"" tracks on the album. I recommend looking at the price accordingly.",-0.05300925925925926

Now its time to learn how to 3D model my 2016 Subaru WRX into the game. Great idea! The best DLC!
It's a pity that popular tools like a table saw, drill press, welder, larger compressor or lathe are missing. A real carpenter's table would also be useful. love it how do i put it in the game hej AMAZING You should charge more for your DLCs The dlc is awesome, but I would like more garage stuff.

I have enjoyed all of Revills previous Christmas solitaire games throughout the years and was delighted to see a new installment this year. And this one does not disappoint. It is very festive with gorgeous artwork, a great story and music to get you into the Christmas spirit.

The aesthetics and expressiveness of this work are quite powerful. It presents various contents in a comic-like form, and the character creation as well as the elaboration of the characters' backstories are truly wonderful (the only pity is that I couldn't find more stories about the villains). I really like this game. It's a pity that there isn't a good enough guide currently, and it seems that it will still take some time before the official version is available. However, just judging from this trailer and these elaborate promotional photos, I'm already eager to buy it! I also really like the sexual elements added by the author. It's not a forced addition but rather a story where they blend and complement each other. It's been a long time since I came across such a story and work. It's both a spiritual enjoyment and can bring great satisfaction on the sensual side. I'm still exploring the content of the game, looking forward to the subsequent official version and the guide. The author is amazing, and I hope he can keep it up! I will keep on supporting!
Again, this is not just a simple game to me, it is an unique and excellent artistic work. Love it A difficult, sexy, deep puzzle game that stands out for being so dark in tone. If you like sexy vampires and big, strong men with troubled pasts, this is the game for you!",0.15367063492063487

While not bad, it‚Äôs short, and the humor didn‚Äôt work for me a good portion of the time, and the giant painting of a wolf in the background in a few erotic scenes worked similarly to an ice-cold shower. Finally, some of the third wall breaks were funny, while others were not. All in all, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs far from excellent, but not a terrible game by any stretch of the word. (5/10)

A final note I have touches upon my personal preferences and will follow shortly. It can be safely ignored when choosing whether or not to get the game if you like guys in an erotic context.

I prefer it when all straight scenes are easily avoidable, as I‚Äôm not interested in those, but I stumbled on a few in this game. You weren‚Äôt involved in them, and it may be possible to avoid them if you know about them beforehand. Nevertheless, since this won‚Äôt bother most people, it likewise didn‚Äôt influence the final score I gave the game, or it would‚Äôve made the review negative. I only mention it in case there are others who prefer it when you can easily avoid straight scenes in futa or lesbian adult games. Too short and no real movement by the characters, its not something i would play a lot Hot girl, sexy body, nice boobs, great dic, but lack of playability.

You can get 100% within one hour, and you just like read a novel with some 3D model's pictures.

If there are more CG, scenes and events, that will make this game better.

909830,Color by Number - Pixel Draw,game,False,"22 Aug, 2018","Adventure, Casual, Indie, Strategy",Color by Number - Pixel Draw is an addictive anti-stress pixel art game. Choose from a variety of fun pixel images and follow the numbers to bring them to life. Pixel Coloring has never been this easy!,"Individual clicks are required to fill each colour box. You can't just click and drag like in the far superior Coloring Pixels or autofill all directly attached same numbered boxes like in any of the Coloring Game games, all of which are available on Steam.

I'm not looking to get a repetitive stress injury from clicking for every box, thanks. let me paint broadly or in batches if I want to. The main game is not bad overall, there are both interesting pictures and not so interesting ones, but what bothered me was the lack of achievements, while the free alternatives have them.
Expansion Pack 1, it's terrible, uninteresting pictures, lots of food, stones, etc. pretty fun dont know why people gave it negative reviews although your hand can get tired from all the clicking
 Good time waster. Don't buy the expansions because you'll be coloring repeats of pictures already colored. I love coloring pixel games and I have a ton of other similar games in my library already. But this one is garbage, thanks to the awful controls. I don't need the smoothest controls and I can forgive a lot in coloring games (I still found enjoyment in other average coloring games), but I can barely finish the first picture in this one. Because for some stupid reason the left mouse button doesn't just color in the pixels, it ALSO is used for moving the picture around.

Let me explain why that is a big problem. In other coloring pixel type games you use the left mouse button to color pixels and the right mouse button to move the picture. Meaning you can just pick a color, hold down the left mouse button and move the cursor around to color plenty of pixels at once to speed thing up and make it easier on your fingers. And once you're done with the first part of the picture and need to move to the next uncolored section, you press in the right mouse button, move the picture to the uncolored section and start the same process over again. Simple. Easy.

In this game though, when you hold in the left mouse button to fill in more then one pixel at a time, instead of coloring the pixels normally, you just move the picture all over uncontrollably. So if you wanna finish a picture, you will have to color in each individual pixel one at a time. All because of the tedious controls. And no, you can't change them. There are exactly two options in the settings. Enable/Disable sounds and enable/disable music. That's it. That's all the settings you can change. Heck, unlike other coloring games you can't even use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out, you just have to use a slider at the top of the screen. Oh and the game also doesn't have an official exit game button, you just have to press the ESC key, meaning that if you press escape expecting to pull up the options, you just close down your game instead.

Just get another coloring pixel game instead. There are plenty on Steam to choose from. This has been a blast playing, like paint by numbers when I was a kid. And with the DLC's they go from very simple to more complicated with much detail. I really enjoy this game bought all expansions I do one or two a day lots to choose from with their DLC 's and other games with the guns and monsters just good work.  Pixel Draw really is an addictive anti-stress pixel art game.  A really good one! i opened it and when i try to scroll down it barely moves at all. does anyone have a fix for this?

if this gets fixed it seems plenty fair for $2

if this does not get fixed then i would question the devs and not recommend Pictures are really nice but I'm really upset that I cannot recommend this game.

I bought it for my 4 and 5 y/o kids.
I was expecting it to be an advanced clone of their favorite ""Sandbox"" game on Android.
It looks nearly the same as mentioned above Sandbox but unfortunately, the gameplay is much worse:

1. There is no way to paint more pixels by double click
2. The DLC does not extend your library - There are just separate games with different pictures.
3. Not sure is it because of the DLC I've downloaded but the basic version does not start out of the box (had to move directories on my disk) as it cannot find the exe file - the path is invalid.

Because of the 1. It is not playable for even for the very patient kids.
I hope it will change in the future...",0.02986731150793652

the gameplay itself is a more shortened version of the original, where the clue combination makes you do just 1 clue instead of 2 in the original.

I just paid for the R44 add on from Steam and I don't have it and can't download it, despite Steam saying ""R44 Add-On is already in your Steam library"". Now I'm going to have to go pay for this add on again somewhere else in order to download it. I love this helicopter. It is really stable and a delight to fly. Loads of liveries and 3 variants. The ones with the pop out floats are my fave, but all are just as great. The only thing I don‚Äôt like very much are the goofy expressions on the people on board. Hardly a knock against the pack overall. If you want a new helicopter and are used to only the stock ones, this is perfect! Actually anybody interested in a new ‚Äòcopter should consider buying. It‚Äôs worth every penny. Before i start off my review i'd like to note i have never flown a helicopter outside of the simulator so i have no idea on if the flightmodel is realistic, that said i'll start my review.

The R44 presented in here including all the details shown above are all there, their is indeed a checklist, animated pilot/passangers and a heck of a lot of liverys.  At first it was pretty hard to controle as the helicopter seems to be nose-heavy so you have to apply a lot of cyclic to keep her level.  When it comes to flight characteristics i have to say i enjoy it very much, as i said i have no experience with real helicopters so i can't say the accuracy is or isn't there compared to the real R44 but that being said it seems that the helicopter acts likes a normal helicopter would and not like the default rotorwing aircraft such as the default R22.  Overall i found this to be my favorite helicopter in my hanger and the speed and good handling makes it for a enjoyable sightseeing helicopter.",0.1677087952697709

[h1]The Final Word[/h1]

Delphinia Chronicle looked like a neat little action RPG with glorious loot -- it called to me -- I picked it up and started playing.

""Why is it in a small window? Can I make this full-screen?""

I furiously searched for the options menu and it was no where to be found. I pressed ALT-ENTER, nothing. Okay, let's keep going.

I created my character then found myself in what I figured was the Town HUB.

""Hey, there's the menu button!"" *click* nothing *click click* nothing happens.

Turns out you need to complete the tutorial before you can access any in-game options. *sigh* 

The tutorial was surprisingly decent -- teaching me how to equip and enhance loot, trying out different character skills, etc. However, I quickly learned navigating menus and inventory panels was infuriating. The tutorial failed to properly teach combat and all the keys, although I eventually figured it out -- later to learn the keys could not be changed.

Tutorial finished, on to a scenario -- fought some baddies, leveled up, and gained a couple skills. All the while loot is dropping everywhere, but there's an odd 2-second delay between picking up each item, making looting a slow and painful process in what is supposed to be a fast-paced Action RPG.

First impressions are everything, and Delphinia Chronicle was a major disappointment, even at its affordable price point.

Get me out of here. Uninstalled. Refunded.

[url=http://discoverplayshare.com/review/delphinia-chronicle]Read the Full Review[/url] Do not buy this game. This is a poorly ported. It's very buggy and not worth $5 at it's current state. I'm asking for a refund.  This game belongs on a mobile device and not PC. Controls are horrible. Some of the buttons don't work such as the menu button, inbox, etc., chatting with the NPC isn't intuitive, my character likes run backwards, a lot of typos, no walkthrough or guide when starting out, when the character are speaking... it does a ""spelling bee style"" by spelling out each character of each word... just a terrible choice of animation/transition. Graphically, it looks nice but that's all it has going for it. Wasd controls are so bad its insane. You copycat Dungeon fighter for literally everything except the controls, and in place of it you add this??? And I can't change it at all? Speaking of controls they are really buggy, and sometime you attack in the wrong direction.

For loot there no intresting effects on weapons, even legendaries, just attack increases. Its so dull. Also whats the point when you can just get all your endgame weapons with cash?

No reason to play over Dungeon Fighter, why isnt this early acess? It's ethier terrible or incomplete. Not even worth a Dollar DLC to get cash INGAME not working. I Bought 3 hours ago and they send nothing. I dont know, its lagging all the time if u want to Loot something/sometimes u need 10 second to loot. The game itself freezes somtimes when a Quest triggers. I'm gonna refund this...

Positive is the Audio! Nice music. Option to take itens sometimes simply "" freeze"" and you can¬¥t take de item sometimes ( this is laughable for a 2017 game).
Can you make it fullscreen?
Will there be an option to change controls in the future? 
Beside minor details, game os really really good! ***This is the first and (possibly the only) negative review I posted on steam, most of time I don't bother posting negative reviews, but this time I felt like I have social responsibilities to let people know what they will run into buying this game.***




This is a cheap mobile game diectly ported to pc.

The UI of this game is clearly specifically designed for mobiles (touch devices), and there is differences/experience/expectations between mobile and desktop. Take, for example, the character‚Äôs skills are shown in round button (I literally want to touch my monitor to cast the spell), but instead you figure out you should press 3, 4, 5, 6 on your keyboard. Same thing goes to the menu and all the sub menu.

The graphics, judging from a PC game point of view, looks weird to me in a way that even though the surroundings, characters, and enemies are all in one screen, there isn‚Äôt many interactions between them, and it gives me the feeling of stiffing when it comes to the combat system. It is further penalized by the poor/low frame drawing; the animation is not smooth.

I do want to say that I only played this game for only 10 mins in scenario mode, however it should give me a rough idea what I am getting into. I will probably consider playing on an ipad but definitely not on a pc.",-0.09662314635718892
542650,On the front line,game,False,"19 Oct, 2016","Indie, Simulation",&quot;On the front line&quot; - tank simulator. Action takes place during World War II. Battles are unilaterally - for the Red Army. Action in the game takes place on two large locations. Sequential execution of combat missions.,"Absolute garbage even for a 1$...the timer on first mission is impossible to beat its stupid dont waste your time on this some ones attempt of a demo and failed...REFUNDED!!! for 1.50 this is quite good - its all 3rd person perspective, but the tank combat is satisfying and a bit more realistic feeling than some other arcadey action sims. I like how everything is destructible and you can go rolling through the forests - its a bit frightening too when in the forests and you can hear the trees falling and you know there are enemy tigers coming This game sucks. I just got it for the card drops.

People who play this should be the ones getting money from the dev, not the other way around. Just don't. I only bought this game since I had a 75% off coupon making the price $0.25. It's not worth the $0.99 price tag. This game is incredibly slow, it will take you forever to get to one place in these tanks, the tutorial mission has a 2 minute time limit and your objective is to reach a town that is about half a mile away, I went straight the whole time and had 1 second to spare. The aiming is atrocious, the aiming reticle does not line up with your tank very well, you have to sit still for a full 5 seconds for it to be accurate and it's nearly impossible to hit your target while moving. And if you mess up and die on the third mission, you go back to the second one, just to add some more confusing game design choices into the mix. This game has a mixed rating, and now I see why. ‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚†ã‚£µ‚£∂‚£¨‚£â‚°ª‚†ø‚†ø‚¢ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø

451650,Whirligig Media Player,game,False,"25 Jan, 2024","Utilities, Video Production","A versatile VR and desktop media player for watching 2D, 3D, and 360¬∞ videos with customizable playback, projection modes, and full stereoscopic support."," this is one of the mostly 90% working VR video viewer that works in linux out of the box with 0 extra tinkering vs any other apps. This app has gone down in quality, continuous issues plague each version. Great for Academic research. I overlooked this application a while ago, at the time it didn't work for my needs and refunded it. That said as I was using DEO VIdeo CPU Gobbler taking 50% sometimes even 100 percent of my CPU, it had to go.

Tried Whirligig and it was way more usable, lightweight and the biggest selling point is it doesn't grind my computer to a halt.
Respect to the developer for taking constructive feedback and making an insane application, has a lot of features other media players don't, I haven't run across any that autoplay the next file. That said its not really plug in play, you kind of have to mess around with it to get what you want and luckily thats where the save/load presets come in handy.

Things I like
Autoplay 
Cosmetic Controllers
Customization of backgrounds
Lightweight
Random file feature, however i wish you could go back instead of that being random but maybe thats just me. like if you pressed Left on the left control stick.
Slideshow

However I do have some requests, Pausing once a menu has opened is really quite annoying, [strike] like if you skip ahead in the progress bar it pauses it [/strike] there's ways to prevent this from happening like binding Up on the left controller to pause play and that's really the biggest complaint or lack of feature from me. 

png webp gif and ( i cant remember if jpeg was one of them) files don't seem to open hopefully that's fixed in the future.

and lastly clicking on shortcuts in the explorer menu specifically the premade ones for clicking on Videos, Downloads or Images can and will break you from interacting with other media, if you try and go to one of your Shortcut 1-10 the files show up for a split second and disappear. which can be annoying cause you can fix the problem not knowing what you did or it doesn't fix at all.

Also I don't know how to reprogram any of the Shortcuts 1 through 10 Has more options for controls than other players, but no proper Index Controller integration (the touch pad is tread as 1 singular button wth), also the tilt control can't be changed from 0,5 increments and give me motion sickness because it's so unsmooth.
Also: why do i have to set the proper 180¬∞ SBS individually for every video.
Way too clunky all in all 58008/10 Deo VR started with low framerates and stuttering badly on loads of videos so I tried this out and it plays them all brilliantly. 

The UI takes a bit of getting used to but overall excellent. well worth the money for such a well put together video player. the developer is also very active with updating and improving the software Don't buy this. Really. I had so many problems with this one app..Images looking blurry, no slideshow option, weird controls and it was hell.

I have an Oculus quest 2 and I bought ""VR MEDIA VIEWER"" which cost more than this but was worth it. If you are like me and want to have a lot of control over your VR images and videos and enjoy having a slideshow function then Whirligig is not the route to take.

1010450,Desire Den,game,False,"19 Mar, 2019","Adventure, Casual, Indie, Simulation",Step into a fantasy unlike any other and interact with unique creatures all looking for one thing. A good time.,"game is good but could use some Lesbian only areas and some bdsm stuff and other stuff What I write for this review is the experience I had with the game, everybody will experience things differently. This is my honest review if you don't like it well tough. Also no game is safe from a review whether its alpha, beta, early access or full release, now onto the review. Also this review is for PC version only.

Desire Den is anthropomorphic sex club game. You can play 3 different characters, a male (Blue Boy), female (Lilly) & a shemale (Pinky). There are intractable characters you can do sex scenes with as each playable characters. However two of the playable characters ( can interact with 5 character (Blue Boy & Lilly) while the other playable character (Pinky) can only interact with 3 characters. 

Issues With Game
1. The main menu mouse arrow sometimes dont appear, you have to hit ESC to make it appear & doing this can sometimes make the arrow stay active on your screen which causes an issue with walking a round, mainly when looking around.
2. The intractable furry Desiree can be interacted with two times when playing with Blue Boy & Lilly but than disappear but when playing as Pinky Desiree is only intractable one time but doesnt disappear.
3. When playing as Lilly & interacting with Lucid, the game will freeze.
4. When playing as Lilly & interacting with Ivarra, the ""special blend"" cigarette isnt placed in Lilly mouth properly due to her height.
5. Chat selecting will cause camera to move.
6. Sex scenes that say right click character+drag character only works on 1 the scenes when there are two scenes that offer the option
7. Johnny (the bartender) doesnt do anything special, can only talk to him. 
8. Lucid is a one time interaction with all characters.
9. Aleph's dialog is a bit slow & stops talking at wrong times. 
10. The hologram isnt worth obtaining since the sex animation is the same for all three playable characters. 

The only positive things about this game is the music & the okay graphics & thats it. I see what the devs are trying to do here but the game on pc just doesnt offer a lot of verity to do. Everything is basically the same scenes just different genders. I think the game could be good if there were more stuff to do, more intractable characters & better sex scenes.  As for now the game is a 4/10, making it below average game.

Thats the Pony review for Desire Den (pc version) Wolf Dick! Sheath! Knot! all these years later....you made the vr a $30 cash grab. YIKES I want my money back, the store page said vr yet it doesn't support it Yeah, definitely don't waste your time or money with this one. There's like, five unique scenes, max, all of which have mediocre looking animations at best. Game *has* potential, but it really just appears as a cash grab in its current state. All the assets in the game are from free models in unity or other random sources. The kobold model obviously being from kobold kare. I can only call this game as pre-alpha. When listening to the speech it sounds like General AI dialogue. Game is listed as VR however does not work with the VR.  Opening screen does not show you cursor so you're left guessing where you're at when you're trying to select play or options. Options do not show key bindings so you know how to interact when trying to interact it to a dead end point and repeats. thou the animated parts are good there is not a lot to do so i do not recommend this to any one and there is no saving the game No matter how long I hold down the E key it doesn't seem to work, something must be wrong. so i havent played all too much but so far its defiantly a work in progress.. i do like it and see lots of updates down the road.. but keep up the work dev! 

bugs i encountered.. camera not moving scenes to see the action.. and chat opitions not showing up

 Gross! Very historically accurate game to what actually happened in the Bible. The Christian church is apostate and against the 10 commandments. They teach the opposite of what the Messiah did, preaching faith alone, OSAS, pretrib rapture nonsense, and they're promoting pagan idolatry like Christmas and Easter. Google the origins of these holidays, it's all ancient Roman and Babylonian god worship that the Lord hates, found nowhere in the Bible. If you want to be saved then you need to actually start obeying the instruction of God, which means not being a partaker of this stuff and keeping the 10 commandments. The church follows the Roman Empire's 321 AD Sunday law instead of the actual Saturday Sabbath commandment, which is the same problem Christ had with the Pharisees:

Mark 7:6-7
6 He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
7 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.

We're supposed to follow the Messiah in truth. Flee from the lies of the church and repent. We can't break the Sabbath, eat abominations like pork and shellfish, or be a partaker of worldly idolatry like praying to wood statues or crosses or christmas and easter. Yeshua, the Messiah, taught you how to be great in the kingdom:

Matthew 5:19
19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

Loving your neighbor means to rebuke sinners so they repent:

Leviticus 19:17-18
17 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.
18 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the Lord.

I've loved all of these in this series and they're an auto-buy for me. This one took me 19 hours to play through the first time and is great for having something to do while listening to audiobooks or podcasts! Really fun and addicting puzzle. Takes quite awhile to finish so there's a lot of content here for the price. Another fantastic mosaic puzzle. Lots of cool facts and beautiful art. This game was quite fun and relaxing for the most part.  It took awhile for me to get the hang of patterns and I found that I had to step away from the game quite a bit as it was tiring. Certainly fun to play but do not expect to complete it in one sitting. Essentially as cool as the other Mosaic games: Very chill, cool facts, and a mid difficulty level that is neither hard nor trivial.

There is a small bug where the formatting of the text isn‚Äôt right, as words are enclosed in underscores but no formatting is applied; But that‚Äôs barely an inconvenience. So yeah, complete recommendation if you'd like a chill-vibe puzzle game to pass some time while watching/listening to something else on the side. 
 thank you for making the glow toggleable! I have poor eyesight and really appreciate that :) love these games!! very relaxing to play. 

Edit: thanks for adding the glow toggle! much easier to look at now. EDIT: The issue has been fixed, thank u!

The yellow color is way too bright and weirdly illuminated. It's extremely harsh and tiring for ur eyes and I would prefer it to be similar to how it looks on the store page pictures
Otherwise the game is good and similar to the previous games, but at least currently it's extremely hard to recommend it because of the color Edit: The fact that the brightness can be lowered is a nice feature, much appreciated! :) Mark Ffrench has done it again.

The puzzles created in this game is quite possibly the best in all of game development and it shows, segregating people based on gender and sexuality is just what the american dream was founded upon. I would love to show my support to hit studio VertexUniverse in any way possible. I stumbled upon this game though hit steam catalog ""Trans-tastic Games"" and they frankly did not recommend it. I am pleased to report they are indeed wrong on all accounts, and frankly that catalog is down right un-patriotic, and i will NOT be supporting it any longer.

Just segregate out the gays and lesbians, put the heterosexuals in groups to the side, lump all the FTM-/MTF- people together, ensure the MTF+/FTM+ people are paired off (Because they're somehow more picky than MTF-/FTM- people?) and then dump the bisexuals into whatever space remains. Easy!

- The customization for making your own swords is pretty awesome. Note: Hopefully, they will keep adding more parts to further customize things.

- multiplayer 
- price [i] My Experience [/i]

I recently played through this with a friend and we had a pretty good time. If you were just to read the game's name and description, you might get the idea that [b]Hot Guns[/b] is fast-paced and adrenaline-fueled, but that would be incorrect. To achieve any kind of success, you'll generally want to approach obstacles and enemies in a slow, measured, and considered way.

Your character can take at most two hits, and this is only if you've found a helmet. It's very easy to accidentally stumble into a bit of fire from one of the game's many explosions, and this will send you right back to the beginning of the level. Sometimes you'll die to a quick influx of enemies, only knowing where they'll spawn from on your second attempt. The number of guns you have equipped affects your jump height, and you'll often have to drop all of your weapons in order to grab the corner of a high ledge. It's worth noting that your gun flies at a slightly upwards angle behind you when you unequip it - sometimes, you can jump and throw your gun up on a ledge this way before jumping up yourself, so you won't be quite so helpless when you encounter the game's next baddie.

My main gripes concerning the title were:
[list]
[*] It took us quite a while to realize that the storehouse is where we're meant to spend the money we're earning in levels. Perhaps the game could give a prompt at the end of each level or section asking if players would like to visit the storehouse and acquire new weaponry.
[*] What on earth is the suitcase that you pick up in some of the levels? What does it do?
[*] In one of the levels there is a lift, and it took us FOREVER to figure out what we were supposed to do here. You'll need to hop on the platform up and to the left of the lift, shoot the cover off of a switch that is attached to a pole, and then pass the switch while jumping to flip it and activate the elevator.
[/list]

Despite these gripes, I can definitely recommend [b]Hot Guns[/b] to play cooperatively through Remote Play Together on Steam. It's not the strongest recommendation, but if you play it slowly and thoughtfully, you'll definitely feel a sense of accomplishment upon completion. come on ... it's Hot Guns :D An addictive game, where chaos reigns supreme. If your go-to attitude is ""shoot first, ask questions never"" then, honestly, you might have some issues, regardless, this will be the perfect game for you. You can team up with friends to grab even more cash to upgrade your weapons further. It's cheaply priced and has plenty of achievements to kill time completing. Ehh..
Core game mechanic of weapons keeping you from jumping high is not a great choice, and weapons looking similar plus duel wielding/weapon swapping being a pain only exacerbates things. Also, purchasing weapons is pointless when you just drop them 4 seconds into a level. The game sort of hits its stride a few worlds in, but there are only 2 or 3 excellent levels that make the gun-jump mechanic seem worthwhile. It's kinda short but I wish it had been shorter, which is not a good thing. Visuals are really fantastic though, only thing that's positive across the board. Quite impressive combination of 3d assets and spritework. In no way a substitute for good game design though.
NGL I played this and forgot it so hard 2 months later I didn't even know what it was in my steam library. I was stunned to see my playtime was 2 hours, it felt like 5.

P.S. Next time you make a game don't put a giant cool gatling gun in it that only appears once, and when it does i have to immediately drop it to jump over a gap, not even getting to shoot an enemy with it once. Was this a joke?? What on earth were you thinking.

I won't remember how much this game irritated me, because I simply won't remember it at all.

   Kinda like DragonForce - minus the questionably ""girly"" vocals - this soundtrack just flat-out ROCKS. That's all there is to it.

   Lots of double-kick, lots of keyboards, and no end of head-banging guitar riffage. Sure, every track sounds much the same - just like a DragonForce album - but you'll get what you get and you'll bloody well like it, Sonny-Jim! 

   A super-easy recommend to all you metalheads out there, especially at such a ludicrously low price for eighteen tracks of slightly below-average song length.

‚òê 10 its gameplay looks like a joke its fun This game is looks very nice , however the gameplay is awful. 

It consist of 90% ""exploration"" in here you really discover health increases, new ""skills"", and more uses of those ""skills"".

Then it is 10% boss fights. This boss fights are fun, they are not mechanically hard but they are a good visual experience, and is the best parts of the game.  

Now, this game is tedious you move like a slug, and THERE IS NO SPRINT BUTTON. The only way to go faster is to use your a limited skill that you obtain. To obtain this skill you have to go through a maze like area. Aside from just guessing which route is correct there is nothing else in the game play area to do. 
If this game had a mode where you just fight the bosses then this game would be excellent. The game would then take like 30 minutes to finish since they are rather easy. But alt east the game would be for 100% of its run time. 

Dont play it, just watch a video of it, if you are interested. Good short game. 
S+ Tier Art style.
S Tier Music.
1 level could be better but the rest were great. Another level had a bug that required a restart but that's an outlier.
Mechanics felt highly responsive and there was animation cancelling, though cycling powers mid combat feels clunky; it should be just number keys instead (with an option to scroll through accessibility settings if needed).
Teaches Norse mythology which is cool. Narration was great throughout

9.35/10 will recommend.
 The art style is incredible and the combat is both dynamic and challenging. It satisfies both the itch for a comfort game but also a game I need to beat my head against for a little while. I can't speak highly enough of the dev team's commitment to the lore; having the dialog in Icelandinc is *brilliant*. I got this for about $2, which is the only reason I won't refund it.

This is almost not even a game.  That doesn't mean there wasn't passion here though... in fact quite the opposite.  But just not for a game.

It's kind of like someone said ""hey, wouldn't it be cool to have a story with really unique music, and authentic icelandic voiceovers?  We could get deep into Norse myth in a way that others haven't, and really show off the beauty of that ancient religion!""  

And they did just that... and did it well, for the most part.  But somewhere along the line they kind of... forgot about the game?

Honestly this is a walking simulator.  The scenery is all hand drawn but it's still... samey for a lot of the map, which is also quite maze-like.  Also, you move pretty slow.  But there's every now and then some really cool scenery or rune or something and a tidbit of Norse myth delivered through some actually really great icelandic voiceover work.

But it's still not a game, really.  There's very little to do.  There's a few token bosses thrown in, probably because they wanted to label it an action game instead of what it really is, which is a Norse maze simulator.

There's so many games in this space.  This one, while artistic, just doesn't command the time that pretty much any other title will. I really want to like this game so let me say I would finish the game if it wasn't so slow. 
This is an exploration game with occasional combat, but it only has combat abilities and nothing to help explore... at least just give the player the ability to sprint when there are no enemies around. 
Sad that the care, passion and effort that went into the art is ruined by the lack of mechanics that would make it enjoyable to experience the game.",0.07275713790026762
877620,Slay the Spire - Soundtrack,music,False,"14 Jun, 2018","Indie, Strategy",Includes the Slay the Spire Original Soundtrack with music by Clark Aboud in MP3 format.,"Solid game; banging soundtrack. Need I say more? No, but I will.

To 90% of the bad reviews on this product: the fact that you couldn't spend 30 seconds to look up or click around on Steam to find out how to view a soundtrack saddens me. Your research and intuition skills are genuinely terrible and you should be ashamed of them rofl. It's literally under the View menu, and in BP there's a Soundtrack section in your library.
So in essence: no you of course don't deserve a refund; you have your soundtrack. Found I was listening to these on YT a ton, so I decided I'd spend the... only $3? Definitely worth it. No FLAC, just mp3, not that I care.

If you're wondering why the reviews for this sit at ""mixed,"" here's a quick, translated summary:

- ""This isn't additional content for the game; it's a soundtrack! What a scam!""
- ""I can't find the Steam Soundtracks menu. What a scam!""
- ""I listened to the music while I played the game, didn't like it, and then... bought the soundtrack."" i dont know if this is a peak game that comes with an incredible soundtrack or the oposite Fantastic soundtrack all the way through. Don't understand the negative reviews at all, I think it fits the game perfect. It's beautiful, it's not too in your face, and it's full of pleasant, ear-wormy melodies. To be honest, I agree with the sentiment that not all parts of this soundtrack perfectly suit the game it's set in (Slay the Spire).
(Slower, jumpier tracks like ""Battle trance"" do definitely work for a card game but as some others have said, most are a bit less 'think and attack' and more 'storm the castle sword in hand' that set perhaps a different tone than you'd except for what you're seeing.)

However, I'll be damned if these tracks aren't earworms.
I really like ""The Beyond"" and I keep coming back to the tracks on youtube to play in the background when working, so I do like their pacing as standalones. Would like the soundtrack for myself offline and to support a little.

I also noticed Clark Aboud also did the soundtrack for another game on Steam called ""Kind Words"" and that has some catchy ones too (see ""Summer Triangle""), so regardless of the suitability of the music, there's clearly talent there methinks! I don't understand the reviews, who buys the soundtrack for a game if they don't like the music?

I bought this for the simple and easy reason that Slay the spire gave me hundreds of hours of fun, and I wanted to support the devs a little more. I don't really like it. It tries to keep you on the edge of your seat, as if a pitch battle is going on. This game is basically a really slow, long, complicated puzzle. It needs mellow puzzle music, background music, thinking music. Not something that hits you over the head and demands your attention. 

For an action movie, this is a good soundtrack. But not for playing StS. quality music YES Clearly I didn't get enough of this from playing the game",0.07079402515723272

A series of your choices will influence the development trajectory of this world.,"One of the S tier FMV game. good story and beautiful FL. 9/10 There is english subtitle very high production and well made, story is kinda nonsensical but is still enjoyable.
best is all actress are so pretty! worth to buy. ÂæàÂ•Ω Wow, i was expecting just another fmv but instead i got a full on period drama/wuxia story with great acting. 10/10 Definitely recommend!
 Great FMV with high-quality production, excellent actresses, and an engaging story. The comedy is spot-on, the duration is just right, and the overall production is top-notch. Highly recommended! This the sixth FMV games I finished till the end and kind of hybrid because although it‚Äôs having subtitle, sometimes I used the Chinese subtitle instead because sometimes the sub is not correct, therefore I played using miclink and yaoudao, a software to translate with better grammar accuracy.

On to the game, since March 14 2025 update, I don't experience any technical issue while playing this game whether it the loading, unsynchronized audio, lagging, stuttering or unable to login.

As usual I play this game using Seagate external hard disk with 5 tb capacity. 

There are many minus points about this game but there are more plus points that should cover the minus.

[B]Minus points[/b]

[olist]
[*] English subtitle sometimes inaccurate
      The subtitle quality generally is good but sometimes it has incorrect grammar but still acceptable.
[*] Weird story writing
     The story sometimes feels weird and not very clear although it has important and meaningful messages
[*] Story lacking
      There are many points of the story that need further elaboration to make it more clear for example [spoiler]when the Main Character investigating the organization, the thing he did is unclear and not like usual investigation but instead enjoying himself[/spoiler] also the last combat could be more elaborated with more scenes
[*] Less satisfying combat sequence
      The combat could be better if it implements QTE during the combat scenes
[*] No achievement
    The lacks of achievement will makes players unlikely will progress through every scene of the story as there is lacks of reward for them to achieve.
[/olist]

[B]Plus points[/b], the reason why I still recommend this game 

[olist]
[*]  Great acting
     The actress did amazing acting to bring the story in to live especially :  [list][*][b] ÁéãÊ•†Ê•† ‚Äì W√°ng n√°n n√°n [/b] (played as [i] S≈´ z«ê m√≤ [/i] ‚Äì the girl who plays music instrument), [*][b] ÊûóÂ¶çÊüî ‚Äì L√≠n y√°n r√≥u[/b] (played as [i] L«ê w«én w«én [/i]) ‚Äì the girls often wear red, [*][b] ÈæöËä≥Â¶Æ ‚Äì G≈çng fang nƒ´ [/b] (played as [i] Y√® y«î [/i] ‚Äì the bodyguard), [*][b] Á´†ÂáØÁé• ‚Äì Cheung Hoi Yuet[/b] ( played as [i] Y«ên r√°n[/i]- the silk merchant), [*][b] ÂàòÊü†ÁÜπ - Li√∫n√≠ngxƒ´ [/b] (played as [i] GƒÅo yu√® [/i] ‚Äì the Governor Wife) [/list] and even supporting actress such as [b] ‰ΩïÈõ®Ê°ê  - H√© y«î t√≥ng [/b] (played as [i]Aunt Lan[/i] ‚Äì Ê®ìÊúàÊúõ‚Äôs manager)
[*] Great Music
      The music in this game including the instrumental are very good and enjoyable to listen to.
[*] Great outfit
      The wardrobe team deserve praise for the amazing and beautiful outfit.
[*] Lots of important messages
     Such as ""knowledge will change destiny"" which highlight the importance of education and literacy and ""what the most important is the citizen wealth and quality of life"".
[*] Detailed production with great environment
The environment is very well created and makes you feels really at China during kingdom era and the props it‚Äôs made very detail such as books with the contents really related to the story
[*] The [spoiler] Ê®ìÊúàÊúõ [/spoiler] transformation that improve the quality of life of the girls living there is great idea although many of the implementation is a bit weird but it gives the girls who looked down in society a better way to earn money.
[/olist]

Based on all mentioned above, I can give this game a score of [b]80/100[/b] because despite its minus it's has many plus value for anyone played the game.

Thank you for Â§ßËÅ™ÊòéÂ∑•‰ΩúÂÆ§, the developer of this game that despite needed some fix and polish has made the game enjoyable enough and gives some important messages to it's players.

For the next production, I hope the story will have better writing and implementation while for me [b] the acting of the actress (specifically mentioned above), the environment and details are already great [/b] and should be maintained. Good game. Highly recommended. i simply love the story - the beauties of cos without saying! Looking forward to more productions from this company - maybe extra DLCs such as before & after this story will be good... willing to pay... Do include other NPCs as well might be fun too! Looking forward! i like the story it's good immersive game actually.
but, on the otherhand when you get the branch option maybe you don't need to end it fast, and can shot a short video how it's react and got end in it. the overall game is soo goood. i'm highly recommend this game for who you are like to in depth the story.
hope you can  have a sequel for better game experience and make it more enjoyable for the branch option story",0.1897377416900318

1534930,Ascii the Brave Cat,game,False,"26 Feb, 2021","Action, Indie","Ascii the Brave Cat is a retro-style 2D action game with awesome new mechanics, cute characters, and memorable gameplay. Meet the never seen puzzles, collect upgrade items, fight creative funny bosses, and push yourself beyond the limit to save someone (or something) you love.","
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. It‚Äôs completely broken. The game just gets stuck on the title screen and doesn‚Äôt respond to anything, no keyboard, no controller‚Äînothing. Hard, when I got the achievement for beating stage 3 only 8.2% of people had got it. But this game is very fun and overall pretty well made (Stage 4 mini boss sucks though) Tough game but really good! I really enjoyed the music and the gameplay tho. I like the fact that its got some anime elements and that its a side-scrolling platformer, I also like the graphics! Although some enemies were a PAIN to take down, but I think this whole thing is pretty creative! This game is very close to being a great, polished 16-bit-style platformer, but there are some major quality-of-life issues that render it close to unplayable. I leave this feedback in the hopes that it inspires the developer to make some improvements, because I truly do like the game that Ascii the Brave Cat is aspiring to be. The graphics are colorful and appealing and the overall game design is thoughtful and creative.

In a nutshell, the game is too hard, not in a ""Nintendo hard"" throwback sense, but in a completely unnecessary and frustrating way. I say this as someone who, though I'm no kaizo mario master, finds most retro throwback games like Shovel Knight and Cyber Shadow to be far too easy. 

Overall, Ascii feels like a game that has only been playtested by the developer, who has first-hand knowledge of what to expect on every level, and not by any actual players. There are jumps that will almost certainly be missed the first time through, enemies that appear out of nowhere that cannot be avoided without memorization (and sometimes still not even then). This would be acceptable and par for the course in a game with generous lives or continues, but Ascii limits players to 3 lives max before game over. I don't mean that the game starts you off with 3 lives; I mean that you can NEVER have more than 3 lives maximum at a time. If you obtain a 1-up and you already have 3 lives, it counts for nothing. (You can collect gems and buy an upgrade that allows you to have 4 lives max, but that's it.) This is beyond absurd for a game that relies so much on trial-and-error experimentation; there are parts where you can accidentally eliminate a crucial platform block and thus create a dead-end, necessitating that you kill yourself and start over. Imagine playing something like I Wanna Be The Guy but you have to start from the beginning after dying three times. I honestly can't think of any other game I've ever played with this severe of a limitation on player lives. There are slot machine bonus games strewn throughout the levels and hitting the jackpot of three 1-ups is nearly always meaningless because of the cap on player's lives.

A related problem is the controls. As another reviewer says, the jumping feels stiff. If a lot of retro platformers are too ""floaty,"" Ascii has the opposite problem and feels much too heavy. After every jump you always feel like you've just barely graced the lip of each platform and even the most simple traversal can feel laborious. (I would never have guessed a game that looks as cute and lightweight as this would have my hands cramping as much as it has.) The game offers full controller support but doesn't feel like it has really thought through how it plays with controller vs. keyboard (and a retro platformer like this should be designed with a controller in mind first and foremost!). For instance, there's a ground-pound style move that is crucial for reaching some platformers by bouncing off floating enemies, performed by pressing ""down"" mid-air. On a D-Pad or analog stick, it's impossible to both hold down and give enough weight left or right to ""steer"" off of a ground pound's bounce. You'll need to remap one of your shoulder buttons to ""down"" for it to really work, but you'll want to also keep your regular down button, too, for climbing ladders and navigating menus. Maybe that doesn't seem like a big deal, but to me it exemplifies the additional thought that needs to go into the way the game controls.

To their credit, the developer is active and responsive and seems to have an idea of the game's difficulty. They've offered cheat codes in the community board to mitigate some of the game's frustrations. But even these cheats themselves have frustrating and unnecessary limits. They'll ""cost"" you 500 gems every time, so you'll find yourself grinding for gems just to be able to afford to consistently restore your 2 or 3 available lives after hitting a tricky segment so you can keep progressing in a level without starting all the way over. 

All in all, I really want to play and enjoy this game. Even after getting frustrated and giving up the first time, I found myself back at it later in the day. However, when I caught myself grinding for gems just to be able to afford enough cheat codes to have a shot at beating the second level, I had to walk away. I only make these criticisms in the hopes that the game is eventually revised into something reasonably accessible. I will happily boot up the game and change my review when this happens.

UPDATE 3.3.21 - The developer has very thoughtfully responded to my review and is continuing to work on the game. I'm going to upgrade this to recommended, because I believe it is at heart a fun game and that it will hopefully get even better and more accessible. This is a fun platformer that you can tell the developer really cared about. 

However, at this time, the jumping feels very stiff.",0.00867876658860265

The setting is great, the Great Powers have their own goals and agendas, there are tons of different units and I love how you are sending expeditions to the colonies as units and then using decisions to influence how those develop. The colonization is definitely something amazing here.

The military system is simply amazing with enough units to make your head spin. Overall, it is a very good and tested system for military matters and it is a much better game than Victoria 2 and Hearts of Iron when it comes to military things and the depiction of 19th/ early 20th century conflicts and WW1.

Give this game a chance and try it. It works really well now and it can certainly be much more fun than Victoria II. Scramble for Africa, like its base, Pride of Nations, are simply great games for their realism and historical accuracy. One must be patient to play and not be goal oriented: just enjoy playing. Only defect I found in Scramble is that on the window 1 of government they still have the leaders of 1850, so Napoleon III is still president on France in 1880 (in reality exiled in England or dead), Tsar Nicholas I still in Russia (dead in 1880), and so on.

We invite you to the dangerous journey of influencer Alex, who is on a trip to Korea!! Your choice will soon become a new story for this film.","This game is definitely unpolished, including language errors in both spoken dialogue and subtitle text errors. The story is kind of stupid, but in a B movie kind of way; definitely not a deal breaker. Honestly, the biggest knock against this game is that is lacks any kind of skip or fast forward feature when re-watching scenes you've seen before; the game has 9 endings, so you'll theoretically want to replay it several times to see the different endings and different branches of the story.

As someone who has some fondness for FMVs and their jank, this one just crossed the threshold into 'do not recommend' for me. However, if you're a real FMV lover, maybe you ought to get it anyway, given the overall sparsity of the genre. The FMV is so good, actresses are pretty, story is not good I had play worse FMV games, 5/10. Actors are not good at all and the history is not very bad, but choices really matter and change things. Like I had write, a fair pass! It was a pretty decent movie. Was laughing at some parts that were meant to be serious, but I like for what it was. Gets a pass from me. A fun comedic movie to watch while high Highly recommended if you love trashy acting and b-movies. I love FMV games, I almost bought and played every full-motion video game on steam. To my disappointment, Lost Angel didn't meet my expectation, especially with the topic of the game itself. When you read the game information about the main character, a youtube influencer getting involved in a dangerous conspiracy, you'd think it will be an exciting story, but once they mentioned the Covid-19 virus, it all went down and started to become a cheap story- not that it wasn't from the beginning due to the mediocre acting.   
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2402022618

The acting is not my favorite part of this game, especially the Korean actresses, if it wasn't for the subtitles I wouldn't know what they are saying. I didn't notice any soundtrack that stuck in my head during my gameplay. I have played it a couple of times to try to get different endings and to give an honest review. The choices you make do matter and it will change the course of the story, there are some major choices, and some of them are just normal and don't affect much on the story. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2402026951

Pros:
+Multiple endings.
+You can skip seen scenes.
+Steam achievements.

Cons:
- Quite short.
- Mediocre acting.
- Cliche story.
- No manual save.

I still wonder why they choose this title name for the game? it is not related to the story at all unless they mean the cure is the Angel.  I'm sorry I can't recommend this game, it is also quite expensive to what it gives.

Also, I still like playing it so far! Overall, I'm mostly thumbs in the middle with this one, but leaning partially down. It's an ambitious effort which I appreciate, and I got relative enjoyment out of my playthrough. The issue: a game like this relies on the player wanting to repeat the game, going back through the other branches of the story and trying to obtain all the various endings (there are 9). Having finished one ending, I have almost no desire to pick it up and play back through. Putting in close to around 90 minutes on this game, that's simply not quite enough to justify the purchase. 

The story plays out like a B-movie thriller; there's some secret conspiracy involving the coronavirus ""cure"" (which I'm pretty sure just means vaccine, not sure why they kept saying cure over and over), you're some cheesy youtuber who gets involved with two women in the middle of it all, you get chased a bunch, chaos ensues. The story is sort of ludicrous but in an entertaining way, and the acting is generally bad but it does give you some laughs which doesn't hurt. There are definite things of value at play, there's just not enough, and the choices are so bare bones you only feel moderately invested. Thumbs down, but wishing the developers the best going forward, as there's potential here. the plot is a bit far-fetched and the acting isn't perfect (especially when they fall down), but overall an entertaining game with many branches and choices that change the course of events",0.008843552582683012
1331821,IL-2 Sturmovik: Yak-9T Series 1 Collector Plane,dlc,False,"26 May, 2020","Action, Simulation","Yak-9T was capable of not only engaging bombers and various ground targets, but could also hold its own as a dogfighter.","37mm presents a compelling argument against Fascism. At least it's not a LaGG-3.

Great fighter, will do what it's told, one well placed 37mm shot will destroy artillery, planes and other tanks, but you only have 30 rounds and a very limited summpy of 12.7mm ammunition to support it.
It does lack ground attack capabilities, making it mostly a pure fighter.

Overall a great plane. This plane is something else. It rewards patience and marksmanship with a devastating NS-37 mm cannon that will cut almost any aircraft in two. The Yak-9 itself is a really decent aircraft capable of holding its own against any German aircraft. The Yak-9T however adds that extra punch that other aircraft in the VVS just don't have.

Pros: 
- Powerful NS-37 mm cannon on the Yak-9 which adds the ability to pulverize any German plane which gets in your way
- The Yak-9 itself is a really capable aircraft. The NS-37 gun on it makes it even more deadly
- it can be a great ground attack aircraft

Cons: 
- Slightly more heavy then the regular Yak-9
- That ammo count is really low, meaning that you really have to hit what you're shooting at. 
- If the NS-37 runs out of ammo ( which it will above the Kuban with the massive dogfights that occur ) you will have to rely on the 12.7 UB machine guns. The Yak-9 regular has other weapons which work well with the UB guns, but on their own they are not the most powerful. 

Final thoughts: This is probably my favorite aircraft in the game. There is no feeling like just hitting the trigger and splinting a fighter or bomber in half with a short burst. I believe this is a must have for any allies or VVS player. A fat Yak-9 is a Friend of Mine ~Soviet Proverb Pros:
Another high quality plane from these great devs.
Very maneuverable for a plane that has a 37mil cannon onboard
Almost identical engine management to most of the other Yaks (7B being the exception) so if you already know how to fly one, you can fly them all

Cons:
Very limited to air only, has no ground attack capability other than its guns. This is historically accurate though but just saying, it is not a do-it-all plane. Unlike the regular 9, this one has the 37mm gun which is great. The HE rounds can destroy normal artillery in one well placed hit and the gun being center mounted in the nose makes it accurate. The AP rounds can disable some tanks if you wanna use it as a tank buster, just come in from the back end.
Really doesn't feel that much different than the 7B or the 1B for that matter, overall. The improvements are not too noticeable. This one is all about that big gun
Similar to other Yaks (except the first one), it has extremely limited ammo. You'll run dry in no time.

Overall worth it, to have a maneuverable Yak with a 37mm gun. Presents a huge improvement over that tank of a LaGG. I don't know about it,
Though the LAGG is pretty good for a One Sortie 1 Kill Wonder.
I will place it in one of my other 200 accounts.
Oh it makes me laugh.
 The One Punch Man of the VVS I've only flown this bird once, but I gotta say: I'm a fan. The ammo count may look low, but place your shots carefully, and you'll be fine. The 37mm is a peach. Get in close and route one shot right down sweet Jerry's pooper, and it's flight over. The flight dynamics are very similar to the 7B but feels a bit heavier, while faster with a solid dive. The visibility is similar to the 1B with a slight reduction in low 10 - 2 o'clock visibility due to the set back cockpit. You get a vertical speed indicator in the cockpit which is nice, but hard to remember it's there after not having it in the other Yaks.

All in all, this is a good plane and I'm anxious to get some more hours in it.",0.13365923674434316

I can only recommend this game if you have a thing for feminization or crossdressing yourself. Nothing particularly interesting happens as it can be summed up as typical highschool events with the occasional reminder that yes, you are a guy dressed as a girl and you don't want anyone else to know but after interacting with you for like 5 mins. they will know. Selina doesn't even look like she was drawn the same way as the rest of the game.

623940,HIVESWAP: ACT 1,game,False,"14 Sep, 2017","Adventure, Indie, RPG","A hand-drawn tribute to hilarious '90s adventure games (with none of the accompanying frustration). Play as Joey Claire, a puzzle-solving teen snatched out of her time (1994) and place (Earth) and stranded on a hostile alien planet on the brink of rebellion.","Guys this game cured my seriousness, its generally good fun A very charming and beautifully drawn and written little point-and-click adventure game that is a must-play for any devoted Homestuck fan, in my opinion. The attention to detail is astounding; you can literally use any object on anything in the environment (which is BURSTING with things to examine) and get a bespoke, specific joke about each combination. And they're all hilarious. That may not sound that impressive until you see just how cluttered Half-Harley Manor is. That Homestuck prose/dialogue charm is definitely still at work here, and every character is instantly lovable. I had this in my wishlist for eons. Man, what a total letdown.

This is an extremely short point & click which felt more like a prologue than an actual chapter, there's adventure games out there available for free with more content and gameplay. Even if you consider Hiveswap as a prologue, it barely counts as an introduction to the Homestuck universe and its quirks since its the sort of story that would make little  sense to anyone outside of the fandom. Hiveswap is aimed only for fans with an unsatiable craving for any new speck of media related to the comic --- and I say, even for diehard fans this would be an OMEGA disappointment.

The visuals are nice and while the game isn't even 2 hours long, there are plenty of animated scenes and quirky dialogue. Problem is, everything is super straightforward with zero problem solving or meaningful player input so the experience is mid to a point this could had been turned into a visual novel and little would had been lost. There are zero puzzles.

I could say that the set up of Hiveswap is a bit interesting, but let's be realistic here: more than half of a decade has passed since the first chapter got released and this game barely had content at all. The chances of the third chapter ever seeing the light of the day are dismal and looking at the premise and lenght story of this first chapter, at minimum this project would need a total of six chapters to be completed. I can't help but think it would be better if Hiveswap got reworked into a comic, animation or anything else so it could spark some interest for the series again.

6/10. Just a very forgettable game Play the game. 8e the 8itch Great animation and a super fun story line, this game deserves more hype for sure! I really appreciate such a beautiful art style, the simple controls make it easy to explore the game and interact with your surroundings, 10/10!! :) it's goofy, has a great style to it and the puzzles are fun but what more can I say then it's homestuck Good My favorite quote of the game,

Your given all kinds of stats and info with no instruction on how best to utilize the info.  This is just plain lazy in my opinion.  I would have given this game a big thumbs up if I wasn't forced to guess as to what the info given to me meant.  Such a bummer. This is basically SIM Tower from the 90's... If you liked that game you will like this game.  IF you missed out on playing SIM Tower this is basically a skyscraper building game with the challenge of managing your funds (build units that provide rent), traffic (stairs and elevators), and managing all of the rent-unit's (offices, apartments, and shops) needs for traffic (too many or too few is bad depending on the unit type), noise control, and services (trash removal, security, storage, banks, etc...).

Take an old classic -- SimTower -- make it a little better and more modern, offer a nice clear progression and win in a reasonable amount of time.

I normally don't review games but I have to add my 2 cents to this one. First to all those who complained about the differences compared to the original Sim tower game , This is not the original and it has been some time since we all lost years of our lives playing the Sim games of old and changes happen.  The creator of this game is to be praised for capturing the basic ascetics of the original and after just under 2 hours play , I can tell you I will be losing a lot of hours in this game. The changes are not game breaking and do not detract from the original. If you have fond memories of all those sim games from yesteryear then you are in for a treat with this one. Play and have fun. This is a good game if you ever enjoyed Sim Tower back in the day.  I like simple simulation games like this and I thnk the developers did a pretty good job.  You'll still find some bugs here and there but overall I think they got it right.  If you can find it on sale, it's an even better bargain. SimTower üëç",0.10739328500956408
3566580,Legendary Heroes Survivors,game,False,"2 Apr, 2025","Adventure, Indie, RPG, Early Access","Slay thousands of monsters and survive until you defeat the ultimate boss. Legendary Heroes Survivors is a rogue-lite game where your character development choices will help you quickly overcome hundreds of monsters that attack you, reach the boss, and defeat it.","I like it Fun, addictive little game! looks almost identical to one i played on the iPhone many years ago, so probably a steram port which is awesome. Keep the updates coming! Aesthetically looks great but as far as the mechanics/options available it feels rather limited, most of the characters feel like reskins. Definitely worth the 3$ but I definitely didn't get invested enough to try every character or make it to the end. Survivors, pure and simple. This game deserves more attention than it gets, while the game loop right now seems a bit repetitive and progress is relatively slow, it is early access after all and assuming we get a bunch more content as time goes on this one could be a great little gem. Right now besides the starter skill most classes feel similar simply because there's a lack of variety in the skills they get, I expect this to get updated but it's still good fun even as it is. Maybe I am biased but in my opinion the fact I've played this for a good few hours now and not seen any crashes or obvious bugs is impressive.

If you like the survivors genre you're almost certainly going to enjoy this, the game loop is your usual kill, level up, die (or complete the stage!), repeat but your characters have a meta level which slowly but surely makes them easier and more efficient to play.

It's also a cool twist that your attack skills at level 6 become an awakened version with big damage, really makes you want to get each of them that far to see what they're like. I kind of wish the passives had an awakened version too but I'm pretty sure they don't right now, hope that gets added for some more OP build fun.

At this price point it is a great game, just give it a go! A fairly decent little survivor bullet heaven with clear, cute graphics and animations. Good feedback on dealt and received hits. Interresting progressing as you permanently levelup with a Novice character in missions where you spend stats strengthening your character. While normal mission levelup is the traditional random skills and passives you can choose from. The game offer a basic Meta progress also with passive upgrades. The price is very affordable.

1696200,Hell Blasters,game,False,"7 Oct, 2021","Action, Indie",Hell Blasters is a bullet hell shoot 'em up where you can blast the bullet hell away!,"I'd recommend anyone to play this cool shooter, especially if they have any type of mental issue. Hell Blasters is a more of a classic shmup borders bullet hells to match its gimmick of managing the players bullet canceling shots and bombs.  Which may be polarizing for an otherwise mediocre shooter.

Hell Blasters is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up that offers the player a wider 'Rapid' shot as well as a slower moving, narrower focused 'Shot' for its basic attacks.  A nitpick of mine would have called 'Shot' Focus instead, as I am too conditioned from Psikyo Games to think of Shot as anything but tap to fire or hold down for charged shot.  In addition to these attacks, the player has limited resource bullet canceling large damage bomb attacks common to STGs.  

What really sets Hell Blasters apart from most shmups is the 'SPC' or what I assume is special attack.  This is limited attack based on a recharge meter.  It seems to deliver additional damage, but more importantly, it cancels enemy shots regardless of color.  As orange bullets are basically popcorn enemies, that become rarer the higher the diifculty.  Where as purple enemy shots aren't canceled by the players normal attacks. 

It's using this bullet canceling special that the player has to master as some bullet patterns don't appear to be dodgable at all. Though, this may happen more frequently due to poor player routing or memorization of the stage that actually getting trapped.  This bullet cancel special does make fights, particularly boss fights, much easier even if they aren't needed to get out of a jam.  And I think the game's overall enjoyment hinges on this mechanic.  I personally don't care for it much.  I'd rather search for a path to avoid taking damage rather than have a weapon that clears one for me.

Otherwise, I don't see much to Hell Blasters to hold interest.  The enemies and bullet patterns beyond making use of the games' gimmick aren't anything special or that memorable.  They aren't bad by any stretch.  They just don't push anything.  The graphics aren't particularly interesting with what feels like 8/16 bit backgrounds with Flash sprites/elements for the ships. And the Flash animation elements largely being simple shapes of various triangles, rectangles and circles.  Defeating the stage bosses are particularly underwhelming consisting of some flashing and an image of the a wrecked part of the boss.  

I found the music and sound fine.  The music particular was good with a few tracks, but nothing overly standout.  Nice little chip tune type stuff that works well for the game.  I've certainly heard worse from the era of games I feel Hell Blasters is trying to invoke.

Overall, I don't think Hell Blasters is a bad game.  It's just not one that I particularly enjoyed.  Well, beyond the Journalist difficulty level, that's funny.  While it's pretty simple.  Which I want in my shmups.  I didn't care for shifting away from dodging to properly making use of your bullet cancel special to clear path mechanic.  If that's sounds neat to you, than I actually recommend it.  But since Steam doesn't have a neutral option, I'm going to give it a thumbs down.  Due to Hell Blasters ultimately not being that fun to me. Very tightly made indie shmup, you can tell the developer is an avid shmup player.  The controls and mechanics are spot on,  although the balancing between the selectable characters is a bit off.  

On top of the usual arcade mode there is practice mode, a very addictive score attack mode, and a content rich story mode which also functions as a training mode.  

The art style is basic but charming and very functional.  Same as the music which is retro style but very good. I have owned and played a ridiculous amount of shmups over the years.  This one keeps calling me back. Not sure why but it scratches some primordial itch.  New arrange mode is the tits as well! Fantastic vertical shmup with great scoring mechanics and challenging gameplay. The story mode is a great way of framing a training mode. The music is also excellent. 

The score attack mode is tons of fun too. Feels like the greatest master system game ever made. And that soundtrack is just amazing. The Boss Theme in particular is such a banger. If you like bullet hell, or shmups or even if you have never played a shmup before, this is an easy buy. Support your indie shmup devs Don't be fooled by the NES-like aesthetics. This is a modern bullet hell shmup with an emphasis on chaining kills (and cancelling bullets), in order to get higher scores (and also there's no screen flickering involved). There's also a good amount of fun game modes including Arcade mode, two characters, a Caravan mode (Score Attack) and even a pretty innovative Story mode. 
The latter can be seen as huge a tutorial not only for the game, but in some ways the entire shmup genre itself. Here you get to play through small sections of the game, are given instructions and are being taught the basic principles of the game as well advanced scoring mechanics. And the story also has many nods to famous shmup classics.

Although I'm not a fan of the entire 8-bit design, the game's look can be quite charming and some tunes are pretty decent. Moreover it features an awesome 9:16 tate mode for fullscreen vertical shmupping. Also the visibility of the bullets is good and it plays very vell.

And by the way, you can participate in the currently running running Caravan Competition run by Shmup Junkie by playing the free demo. I'm fairly new to playing shoot em ups (shmups) to actually be good at them rather than just credit feed my way through an arcade game. I wanted to get into 'bullet hell' shmups but the games are really intimidating. This game was recommended because the designer is an accomplished bullet hell player who made the gameplay the top priority - and made it so you can use the story mode to actually learn to play a bullet hell.

It's been an absolute blast and the story mode really delivers bite sized chunks of training and the arcade so you can practice them and learn how to deal with the enemies. 

I'm also participating in an online score attack competition for the game that is incredibly fun and I don't normally play for score, only survival. 

While the graphics are rudimentary, the bosses have a nice charm to them, the 8bit soundtrack is actually quite good, but most importantly the gameplay is REALLY on point and I'm absolutely loving it as someone just learning to play a bullet hell. This is the Bluesmobile of shmups. It may not look like much on the outside, but it's got the cop motor, cop tires, and probably even the cig lighter. Great level design & bullet patterns, a ton of modes, leader board & replays, great shmup tunes, it's all there. Great work, devs!",0.17260559712546467

You‚Äôll face various logic puzzles, challenging arcade levels, cunning enemies, and unexpected surprises.","This game is only playing keyboard Well making game.
Good making funny adventure puzzle game.
 good Sure, I guess I dislike it.
I understand that this is an indie game, but I felt frustrated completing it. 

It's not responsive especially if you try to enter a fast keyboard sequence. And the way it makes the game harder (which is lame) is through speeding up the gameplay  [spoiler] (especially during the 2nd playthrough) [/spoiler]. With a mix of unpolished stuff included, I do not recommend this game. Interesting gameplay and quite hard i review games on steam after i 100% complete them! check out my reviews to see all the games i have completed!

keyg is a puzzle game in which you maneuver around using the keys on the keyboard, moving from Q to W, and so on and so forth. there are varying levels of complexity. full price is $5, but i got this for 90% off (49 cents) and i could not recommend that deal enough. this isn't the best cheap puzzle game you'll find on steam, but it definitely is one of the better ones that you should buy. top tier üóø Original concept but boring and tiresome. Pretty bad game. Not a puzzle game, just an arcade one. So nop, not for me despite the puzzle game tag.
By that i mean, i could have liked a puzzle game with a SMALL emphasis on action. Action here is the main word and puzzle is far far far beyond. Quite original controls. Not easy to get used to, but certainly a great change from most standard games. It's almost free, so it's certainly worth its cost. Is it fun? Perhaps after one plays for a long enough amount of time and get fully used to how the player is controlled, but I'll recommend it regardless for its unique control style and low cost. The way I see it, keyg is a puzzle game that relies a lot on knowledge and very major experience with puzzles like these. It has a simple yet smooth style to it, and somewhat meh but fitting music to go with it. However, there are a few things that can be done better.

Hint System / Difficulty Change
I think it would be a bit better if a hint system could be added, or a sort of difficulty changer, as a lot of this took some intense brain power and a bit of guide reading. It seems that this can rely on some forms of knowledge that not everyone may know, like roman numerals, as well as a few things you may need to take a guess on. A lot of this was guessing because the clues for the levels weren't very helpful, though it is nice that difficulty was provided. It also becomes a bit annoying how in the reaction time levels I have to repeat it around 30 times just because I got clipped right at the last section or my game couldn't react fast enough to realize there was an open space to move through. Speaking of, this moves me to my next suggestion:

Please Fix the (somewhat) Lag
The lag in question isn't really lag, but more of a problem that the game can't react fast enough to. If I try to move fast in a level where I have to be quick, I bump into an open doorway like it was a normal wall and have to spam the button to really get in. This isn't that important of a problem because you can just spam the button to get through, but I do recommend that it's fixed.

That's just about it, actually, everything else I really enjoy. Good style, good music, great story, but the gameplay could be better.

I would still recommend, 7/10.",0.07805435305435308
1569180,The Kotonoha Sisters and the Legend of Lysant Island,game,False,"3 Jun, 2021","Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",This game is a turn-based action RPG that moves around in a 3D space where you can enjoy various scenery with cute 2D characters. Operate the Kotonoha sisters and explore a fun and mysterious island!,"Áê¥ËëâÂßâÂ¶π„Ç´„ÉØ„Ç§„Ç§„É§„ÉÉ„Çø„ÉºÔºÅ„Å®„Å£„Å¶„ÇÇÈù¢ÁôΩ„ÅÑ„Åß„Åô......ÔºÅ Loved every bit of this game. 

There's even Chocomint Ice! To say that this game is a hidden gem would not be an overstatement at all. ITS A GREAT GAME IF ONLY IT WAS IN ENGILSH fun. but it's in chinese For those who don't know, The Kotonoha Sisters are characters made by A.I. Inc, and where first released as voice-banks for the Japanese voice synthesis program VOICEROID. They also have voice-banks for A.I. Voice, NEUTRINO, and SynthesizerV.

The game is solid! The fights are cool and the use of VOICEROID is very creative. I only speak a bit of Japanese, so I can only understand a portion of it, but it's still very fun! [h1]ÊúÄ OF THE È´ò[/h1]

The Kotonoha Sisters and the Legend of Lysant Island is something truly special. I'm a huge fan of doujin gaming and love to see the passion and creativity that small development teams often bring, and this game easily ranks amongst the best of them, if not the very best I've ever played. 

Created entirely by the talented uwag0-sensei, this game is an adorable homage to the Paper Mario series starring the cute voiceroid twins Akane and Aoi Kotonoha. If you're not familiar with the voiceroid scene or the characterizations of Aoi and Akane, that's entirely okay as the game stands more than strong enough on its own merits (but I would nevertheless highly recommend checking out GYARI's songs ""Akane-chan Will Listen to Whatever You Have to Say"" and ""Aoi-chan Is Going to Eat Chocomint No Matter What"" as they absolutely influenced some aspects of the game!)

The game begins with our two protagonists marooned inside their own hotel room. They had won a winter trip to ""The Land Blessed by the Goddess of the Sun,"" Lysant, worked part time jobs to save up enough spending money, and were excited to enjoy ~Endless Summer Fever~ at the beach, but when they arrived at the country, they're greeted by endless rain. And since it doesn't normally rain in Lysant, the airport only sold expensive decorative umbrellas and they could only afford one for the two of them. And the hotel doesn't even have an indoor pool to enjoy! 

Exasperated that their entire trip was about to become a washout, they ask a hotel attendant if there's anything remotely summer-esque they can do. There wasn't -- but they learn of a festival being held that day as part of a ceremony back to ancient times when it rained just like this, where the Goddess of the Sun confronted a rain demon causing the endless torrential downpour and was ultimately sealed away with it. As a tradition, the villagers choose someone to play the role of the Sun Goddess during the festival in hopes of abating the rain. 

During this ceremony, lightning strikes and the skies miraculously clear, returning the sunny weather to the village -- except Aoi is now unexpectedly possessed by the Goddess of the Sun herself. Immensely confused, the Goddess quickly tries to pretend like nothing is wrong, but realizes that the seal on her had been broken -- and along with it, the rain demon's must have been as well. She quickly assumes Aoi's identity and pretends to be Akari's sister so as to not worry her, but realizes that other parts of the island must still be raining, so she must convince Akari to go on an adventure with her to seal the rain god away under the guise of going sightseeing. As the game progresses, you become increasingly entangled with a religious sect of the island who worship the rain god, Reavy Hain (subtle!)

The game is predominantly a light hearted comedy, much in the same way Paper Mario is. uwag0-sensei clearly put a lot of thought and love into the script, and the two sisters (or one sister and one goddess) play off each other incredibly well. I'm not the sort to laugh out loud much, but, well, I laughed out loud quite a lot during the game. There's rarely a dull moment to be had. 

But what I find interesting is that the game also has a serious side to it. There's an actual legitimate story told, and, despite starring the often wacky Kotonoha sisters, I was surprisingly invested. Sure, most of the antagonists are borderline jokes themselves, and there's always something to lighten the mood (with the exception of the main villain themselves, at least!) To me, it feels like it was a bold move to flesh out the story and setting as much as the game did, and it's one I strongly feel worked out very well in the game's favor. 

Ultimately, it works because Lysant as a setting is actually interesting! One aspect of the game I adore is that it really puts a lot of effort into the smaller details, and it's those sorts of games that really come together in the end and make a memorable experience. There's lots of NPCs in the game who basically don't have anything to do with the main questline, but have their own personal little stories that progress as you do throughout the game. They never amount to much of anything, but it adds just a small enough touch to the world to make the island and its culture feel alive. All of them have their own unique sprites and manners of speaking, and most of them are pretty cute in their own way, too! 

There's tons of hidden collectibles to find in just about every area, and they'll often make you think of clever ways you can maneuver the terrain to get to them, too! Small things like that add up to a very enjoyable experience!

Speaking of culture, the island actually has its own language, too! The Goddess of the Sun can understand the language, but Akane cannot at all. Aoi can understand a tiny bit. The game appropriately gives you three options for how it displays the foreign language, including an option to have all of it display no matter what. As someone who is not a native Japanese speaker, I found the option to display all the dialogue in Japanese at all times pretty helpful -- besides, there's some great dialogue you might miss otherwise, so I think it's probably the best option overall no matter how good your Japanese is or isn't.

Battles are few in number but surprisingly fun to play. Aoi/Goddess can only cast spells and can't be interrupted while doing so -- Akane will get an increasingly larger inventory of weapons and shields to deal with different enemy attacks and fend them off long enough so Aoi can cast a spell. Most often, the most effective approach is using Akane's umbrella to parry an enemy at just the right time to not only nullify damage, but deal damage to the enemy (one of the only ways Akane can actually do so, I might add.) Enemies are permanently dead when you defeat them, so you don't get tired of fighting the same enemy over and over and over again. Enemies also have different random patterns to try and psyche you out, which can keep you on your toes even during a rare repeat battle. It is not a super difficult game, although the final boss can be surprisingly tough (but there's plenty of ways to cheese them!) 

I'd be remiss to not stress just how important the cute aesthetic is to the core of this game. Nearly every Japanese review of the game has the word 'kawaii' written in it at least half a dozen times. They're not wrong. This game is absolutely adorable. Not just the characters. Everything from the dialogue, the sound design, the music, the atmosphere, this game absolutely nails the kawaii-aesthetic in ways that just about nothing else does. The creator REALLY understands cute, and cute is king behind every single design decision in this game. If your heart doesn't sing when, upon drinking some juice, the two sisters make an audible ""aa-- goku goku!"" sound, I might suspect you're not human.

Clocking in at around 15-20 hours, the game does not overextend its welcome, feeling complete and satisfactory with a nice ending to boot. A tremendous amount of passion was clearly poured into the creation of this game and it overwhelmingly paid off. Though I've written far more than I intended to, I still don't think it conveys just how much I enjoyed this game. If I could convince one person to give it a shot, I think it'd be worth it. I at least want to let the author know how much their work is appreciated!

The game is, unfortunately, only available in Japanese as of this moment - the creator is on the record saying there are no plans for an English release, as it is presumably very difficult for a one-man development team to commission and fund it, especially for a game like this with so much dialogue, but it would absolutely be my dream job to help translate it someday! For those who can read Japanese, especially voiceroid/paper mario fans, you owe it to yourself to try the cutest, most charming game of our time. cute artsyle and a nice battle system Pretty decent game. 
The OST is nice to listen to, the art style is appealing to look at, and the game play hardly gets repetitive.
Getting lost is rather easy when you can't understand the language but the game is rather simple enough that just looking around or using a translation app can skip around that issue.
Game time should span around six hours if you don't run into save issues, so I would say it's worth the price for what it gives. its good turn based rpg only problem with the game it has no english so you cant tell what there saying or the story unless you just wanna make it up from the pictures in the beginning of the game",0.09653712449167

Get it if you want to kill an hour and have fun! It was ok... It could be worse! Even though it's just 2 bucks, it's a very boring game and doesn't really have much about it. Personally can't say I'm a fan, but hey, it's cheap so if you think you'd like it, go on ahead. The sound is good and the graphics are ok but size is an issue - tiny resolution that looks bad scaled to fullscreen. Oldschool arcade style progression; play until you die and enter your initials via high score table.. though the 'continue' feature lets you resume where you'd left off, score intact ;) The gameplay is not great. You simply move the tanks around avoiding bullets while they auto-fire on enemies. Two tanks at once just doesn't make sense.. too much going on to control both, unless you have two heads.. which I don't. The game play is just not very engaging
 The idea is rather nice, it just does not work.
You somehow need to control 2 tanks but the controls have a bit of lag. This game is going to be brutal on your mouse and/or you'll suck at it :D
Even with the low price the game comes at I can not recommend it for PC players. Terrible controls make it almost unplayable First level already is not possible to win without using ""friendly fire"" of the enemy, i.e. positioning in a way that the enemies kill each other. Not a good starting level.
But the most problematic thing is the control scheme. To move a tank it is necessar to click it first and then click the target location. Afterwards the tank is deselected, i.e. it is necessary to click again to reselect. This makes the control nonfun.
Note that in the current version the resolution is fixed to 1024x something, leaving a lot of space around the battlefield.",0.03165575559192581

2304650,The Scrap,game,False,"5 Aug, 2023","Action, Adventure, Indie",The Scrap is an independent third-person shooter that takes place in a futuristic world inhabited by robots.,"This game deserves some credit. Yes there isn't checkpoints but you don't need them since levels are short and not difficult. Yes the FPS is a consistent 30-45 and hangs on explosions but it is playable. This game is gorgeous and FUN. It is short but that's great since it is so unoptimized. Someone should offer to fix this for them. AHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH it's genious! This is a low budget third person shooter where you play as a robot shooting other robots. There are only four short levels and then a boss fight. Shots from enemies do way too much damage and there are no difficulty settings. There is also no way to manually save or checkpoints. So, you will have to start each level entirely over when killed. You also cannot remap the controls and the voice acting is computer generated. I also experienced some massive frame rate drops, like below 10 fps, in the final boss level during the constant explosions. Overall, I found this to be a fairly cheap and janky experience. I cannot recommend this game, as I would rather play better shooters. This game unfortunately disappointed me, especially for the price. It is a beautiful game, absolutely gorgeous in my opinion and runs really well for the graphics quality. That's about the end of my praise though. The customizations options are very limited. There aren't many graphics options, but there is just enough I guess. There is no key or controller remapping. The designated key maps in the menu aren't what they actually are in game. Oh, and the voice acting left a lot to be desired. It wasn't just that they had a heavy Russian accent, that's fine. The voices just sounded kind of harsh, and not warm enough. They don't fit into the game smoothly. I could easily look past the few issues I've listed so far. They aren't a huge deal, although many games that are half the price or less can get all of that right. What I can't look past comes down to how the game plays. It's not very smooth and the controls and actions are a bit confusing. Firing guns does feel quite good, but movement and aiming are just off. I quit the game on level 2 after my character got stuck in the ""cover"" position. I feel like this game really should be in beta or early access at least.  It just doesn't have the level of polish that a fully released $15 game should have. Of course I don't expect AAA levels of quality at this price, but I do expect it to feel good to play. Hopefully the developer sticks with the game and gives it some much needed love through some patches. I would be willing to play it again, but not in its current state. I would actually love to play it again if it felt better to play. I'm a sucker for eye-candy and this game has tons of it! Has potential but feels like it's still in early access. The combat feels punchy but the cover system didn't always protect me and I got hit a lot whilst peeking. The harder aliens you encounter deal too much damage, so it's a shame you can't keep the med packs for when you actually need them. Some of the dialogue from the robots get cut short and the music starts and stops abruptly, so there's some cleaning up needed there. There's also no resolution setting in the menu either, so you can only play in what I assume is 1080p. I only played this for 15 minutes so maybe there's more to this game but from what I experienced there's not much to interact with.

The Russian asset flip scammer behind this filled out a basic template in the craptastic Cocos2D (a blight on gaming), changed the name/reskinned a couple of things, and put it on Steam as if it was their own game.

Aya's Journey is an unabashed, lazy ripoff of Limbo (Copyright Playdead/Microsoft Game Studios, 2010).  Many lazy ""amateur"" developers don't pay attention to their obligations under copyright law, and often steal the ideas of actual, real game developers without credit, such as the ""developer"" here has done.  At this stage no legal action has been taken by Playdead/Microsoft Game Studios against the ""developer"" here, but it's never off the table, as previous copyright law cases have shown.

Putting aside the unethical intellectual bankruptcy of stealing someone else's game concept for profit, this is also breaking that unwritten law of stealing other people's game ideas... you should at least try to do better than the game you're ripping off.  Aya's Journey is considerably worse than Limbo.

Boogygames Studios have shown a repeat pattern of unethically dumping other people's work onto Steam as a cheap, nasty cash grab, through this account or through closely linked/alt accounts.  Here's some examples so you can see for yourself:

Taking this shovelware seriously as if it was a genuine attempt to make a game, it doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The implementation here is of such poor quality, the developer couldn't work out how to make the game display in fullscreen, it only runs in a window.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 3 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from, the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

Aya's Journey is relatively cheap at $3 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, and the questionable ethical nature of the developer and/or their associates (as outlined above), this is impossible to recommend. I've played like 10 minutes, the rest of the time the game was running on the background because there is no music so I never noticed it's there. So yeah, problem number 1 - there's no music on Linux. Which makes the whole experience more dark than fun. Also, so far it's like some neurotic Super Mario. Jump up and down, die, again, die, again, etc. Moving with the arrows is a bit unnatural after all the games using wasd and also so far it's hard to measure the jump well. As a whole, for now, it looks too hard to me. Of course, after 10 mins I cannot claim I know the game, I'll give it probably another half an hour, but so far it's just not so fun to play it. I got to the part where you spend 20-30 seconds lugging a box up a hill to do 1 difficult jump. It was instantly extremely tedious and annoying... This game ain¬¥t definitely like Limbo. It¬¥s just a jump game that looks like it. If you wanna run, jump and die thousand times because of the bugs in this game, go for it. The game is not finished and I don¬¥t think they¬¥ll fix something in the future. Don¬¥t buy it. This game so want to be LIMBO, but lacks any of the heart and cleverness of that particular gem.
It has annoying platforming, with sudden meaningless deaths (why does touching a boulder after it has stopped rolling kill me?).
I couldn't even work up the enthusiasm to finish it. This is a change in pace for me, because I genuinely hate writing this review.
I've wondered why the 'Limbo' style games never caught on. Until now. This game is like Death Stranding, except bad. Bad in an irredeemable way. I don't even think it matters what I say, because this game seems to be in eternal 'Early Access.' It's very likely the 2 people working on this game (that's not a joke), gave up on this project as no progress has been made in 3 years. 
But hey that's what happens when you allow 2 people to run a game company with ADHD. (that's a zinger).
This game was made with paint, and runs at 60 frames. Only problem is that at most, any given object has 2 frames. Including our Limbo rip off. Of which, you can't tell if they are looking into the awful repeating background or blinking every second. 
You know what made Limbo's dark atmosphere great? It blended well, it was quiet, it allowed the curiosity of the player to do the work for it. This game just throws a bunch of random fucking RNG puzzels at you, without the slightest hint of how to complete them. GOOD THING THE GAME HAS A NO LAG JUMP THAT YOU CAN DO ON ANY SURFACE REGUARDLESS OF SLOPE. Does this game need work? Yes, it needs to be blessed, because I gave it to the end, I ACTUALLY PLAYED THIS GAME, and I have nothing but resentment for the 2 ass hats who made this game look like it might be good. 
SPOILER: [spoiler] IT'S NOT [/spoiler]
Oh also, here's a first, this ""music"" is great for 1 minute of reveal trailer nonsense, but a single track for an hour, makes me want to rip my ears off, shove them into YOUR ASS, so I can listen to the sweet sweet release that is the SHIT OF THIS GAME. 
Please, developers, please actually work on this game?
Yeah? Got questions on how to improve it? I got tons of suggestions, but this isn't an ""Aya's Journey suggestion."" It's a review, and as they say in Poland:
It's shit. I enjoyed it. It's a simple game. I'm a simple man. Terrible game. Stay away! It is just a ripoff of Limbo {which is a suberb game!} but this game has NONE of the good points from Limbo. It just looks like Limbo. This game is a total ripoff, it's not fun, you die without warning, you can't go back, the kid is like 3 feet tall but can jump 15 feet into the air, it's not at all cute, fun or entertaining. All Thumbs Down. Looks like a rip off of Limbo but doesn't play like Limbo.  Very unpolished game.  Maybe the devs will prove me wrong but as of now IMO its not worth playing.",-0.09242219876456326
887850,TAL: Arctic,game,False,"11 Jul, 2018","Adventure, Casual, Indie",TAL: Arctic - In this game you need help an unknown creature to go in the magic portal across many mazes.,"60 lvl's seems excessive. after about 40 i was dragging. you can ""occasionally"" find these little ""glowy orbs"" that you can use to buy 2 other skins. dont bother getting all of them because i discovered that after you buy the skins you end up with 5 left over. no footprints either. music is nice. no reward at the end, you do get an ""achivment"" after Every Single Level. then you get an achiv for getting all the skins. thats it. also seems meh to have to buy x5 games at 99cents each. why not make chapters? why not a timed option? why not an element of danger towards the end lvl's? nice relaxing game (to a point) but becomes a headache later. do less levels, add some mods, add a timed mode, make an ending of some kind (even if it's just a picture) just something. A game that requires literally a second or two of mentally calculating a path to the exit before an EXCRUCIATINGLY LONG WAIT as you control the sprite for it to eventually get there. If the speed of it was 10x as fast, then it would be an easy completionist game. Its a short and easy maze game. 1 level 1 minute, boom. :D fast completing game... really F A S  T . 
no obstacles no enemies.. nothing... 
 I can't say I recommend this game.  If you already own it or are getting it as part of a bundle it may be worth playing through for the achievements but the game itself is boring and fast to complete.  There are no obstacles or enemies and the mazes weren't challenging. Fun little maze game.  I love the music it makes everything creepy vibe. red skin looks like devil but i am not even sure what that creature is but looks cool. I wish that there was option to use arrow keys, it would be amazing if that creature moved faster and cough up in corners less often Amazing gameplay, 10/10 graphics, challenging maps, great enemies, epic storyline, best soundtrack of the year.

I have nothing to compare it to. The barbarian run animation alone is worth the positive review. Fun game and intend to play more. √â aquele tipo de jogo que quando vc faz alguma coisa vem uma satisfa√ß√£o acompanhada. Por exemplo: O barulho de pegar a ma√ß√£; Passa a fase com 3 estrelas; Toda hora √© uma 'quase' morte e toda vez que vc escapa √© satisfat√≥rio; entre outros....

O game tem um climinha de zoeira que faz ganhar muitos pontos em carisma! 
Em rela√ß√£o aos achievements, tive somente algum desafio no que tem que zerar no modo hard.

O principal ponto forte do game seria a divers√£o! 
Recomendo muito! I enjoy the other Retro Army games quite a bit and definitely recommend people check out Super Trench Attack! However, this game, despite being dirt cheap, didn't fill me with a ton of joy. It works, plays okay, looks okay, and is exactly what it is described as. However, the inventory isn't explained as well as it could and the levels are a repetitive slog. This is made all the more annoying on Normal and Hard difficulties since collecting apples, think pellets in Pacman, also increases a poison meter for your selected character. What that means is that if you are aiming for 100% on Achievements, you will likely have your characters die off, not be able to revive them, and have to wipe the save and start all over again. I played on Normal and that happened to me in the last dungeon/gym. So I wiped my save and started on Easy where the poison meter is absent. Was able to get 3 stars on all dungeons that I could find, yet there didn't seem to be an ending, even a cut to credits, that I could find. Very glad I didn't waste more time trying to beat the game entirely on Normal or Hard. Not a terrible game, but not one that I'd recommend. Top-notch. Simple but fun! It has a solid challenge curve that builds up as you play. A lot of room to develop your skill to get good at this and max your ranking and unlock everything. Simple ,cheap, and fun. Dungeon Marathon
fast game with modern day graphics with easy controls that moves from location A to B to C and so on,

good game.
Personal Suggested Purchase Price: $0.49 Or Less During Sale
 So... Dungeon Marathon, neat.

Honestly this is probably one of my least favorite Retro Army games... and yet I enjoy keeping it as part of my collection.

I would call this a speed run game except it isn't, it's more of a...run around and collect apples while avoiding enemies maze game.  Like Pac Man except you're playing probably the most obliviously stupid fantasy heroes of the land.  I get my good brand of juvenile humor I expect from Retro Army but like any Retro Army game I also get the seeping dark undertones that add a twist to the gameplay.

The freaking apples. [spoiler] Not really much of a spoiler, but I would leave you to enjoy the realization that the apples from the mysterious gender indeterminate ""gym"" owner are also poisonous and will eventually kill you when your ""poison meter"" reaches 100%.  The good news is you can buy a detox potion...for 1000G which you'll only get by being good at eating Apples...see the dilemma? [/spoiler]

And so that's what this game comes down to, managing 4 runners while trying to beat the game and not completely screw yourself in the process.  The control and collisions are a little weird sometimes but you can get quickly used to it.

A decent time waster if nothing else. [h1]Review # 45[/h1]

[b]Impressions of the game[/b] 
The biggest reason I‚Äôm giving this game such a low score is because of its premise. I initially was intrigued by a game that was a ‚Äúdungeon‚Äù esq. game with no combat however I quickly found out that the two didn‚Äôt mix as well as I thought. I get that one of its biggest marketing points was just this (see game description) however, if that is the case then the gameplay must feel tight and the hit detection must be nearly perfect. Neither of these two criteria were met. Often times I felt my character was sliding rather than running. Im sure there is fun to be had here for some but, I can definitely say that it is not my forte. If you are still interested I would highly recommend getting it when it is dirt cheap only.",0.07766647470775909

Nice game all play I've tried to give this game a fair chance. It has a huge potential to be a great game. BUT it's extremely frustrating to play. Your 2 choices of playing it, are vs other humans, or vs AI. And when you fight the AI, they tend to have like 3-4 units for every 1 unit you make, destroying you 95% of the time. I've played probably 10 games, and I think I only won 1 of them, maybe 2. There is just too strong of a momentum curve vs. the AI.",0.07756410256410254
