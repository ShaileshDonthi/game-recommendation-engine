1406930,Space Travel Jigsaw Puzzles,"""Space Travel Jigsaw Puzzles"" is a basic asset flip, the developer stole a bunch of photos from NASA and slapped them on a jigsaw puzzle game asset pack from Unity so they could get famous or something.  The only remarkable thing about this is they forgot to slap a huge price tag on it so they can get your money for NASAs images.   Oops.  Anyway this kind of thing could be done in a web browser, no need to go through the effort of downloading, installing and launching something through Steam that your mobile phone or Firefox can do more quickly. doable, love how if i get stuck it can try help by completing for me and tells me which I have already completed. Space Travel Jigsaw Puzzle, NASA'dan güzel görüntüler içeren ücretsiz bir yapboz oyunudur. Zorluk arayanları tatmin edecek tam kapsamlı zorluk ayarlarının yanı sıra, sadece bölgeye ayrılıp izlemesi gerekenler için otomatik mod. ☀️ ⠀ [h1]Before I played Space Travel Jigsaw Puzzles, I had a small pp, no friends, no gf, depression, and no life. These things havent changed, but the game is pretty good[/h1] It's puzzles. Nothing revolutionary, but if you want puzzles, you got em Relaxing puzzles of Space! And Earth and stuff. 100% recommend. Easy, Medium and Hard levels.  Beautiful pictures.  No frills, no gimmicks. No purchases or add-ons. No advertisements. This isn't as good as the jigsaw games I paid for such as Glass Masquerade and Cat's Life Jigsaw Puzzles, but this game is worth downloading for free. ;) Really not a fan of this puzzle game. Here's a quick list of the reasons why:

- Modes are called easy, medium, and hard, and don't list the piece count
- On hard mode (which is more what I would consider medium difficulty) the cut of the pieces looks really rough and janky. You can't really tell which pegs fit in which holes because they look like they were cut out by a three year old, but digital. There are stray pixels and whatnot, which makes them a useless indicator of where they fit
- The pieces snap to a grid regardless of if they belong in a place. This is extremely frustrating to me because it feels like I can't move them around as freely as I would expect. Instead of using snapping to grid to indicate solely that you've found a piece's place, it will, instead, snap to the grid and make a loud DING noise when you find the right place. Overall, the feel of the grid snapping is very unpleasant and unnatural to me.

I haven't played very long, but it didn't take long to get the vibe of the game and that's most of where my complaints lie. More power to you if you like the way it feels to play 배경음악 on/off 가능, 설정 메뉴 없음.
우주, 행성, 우주선 내부를 테마로 한 퍼즐 맞추기 게임.
일단 한 번 완성한 퍼즐은 완성한 적이 있다고 표시가 되지만 저장 기능이 없어 한 퍼즐을 맞추다가 중간에 게임을 종료하거나 메뉴 창으로 나갔다 들어오면 맞추던 퍼즐이 초기화되며, 완성한 퍼즐도 매뉴 창에서 완성했던 퍼즐이라며 표시만 되고 다시 들어갔을 떄 퍼즐은 초기화 되어 있음. I love jigsaw puzzles, but I don't have the space to do them and my pets usually destroy them before I finish. Because of this I've been looking for a good virtual alternative, and this game is it! It felt just like I was sitting at a table putting together a puzzle in real life. No stupid bells and whistles and no complicated controls to take the fun out of the game. I look forward to more from the devs in the future. PROS:
completely free to play
3 different difficulties: easy, medium and hard.
CONS:
no settings (had to mute the music from the volume mixer)
 good game Existem três modos no jogos sendo Easy, Normal e Hard. Gostei da funcionalidade auto que facilidade a vida um pouco caso esteja com problema em achar as posições das peças. São 44 imagens belas, só achei meio estranho ter algumas fotos de natureza com tantas espaciais maravilhosas, poderia separar em categorias caso fosse feito assim (clicar para ""space"" e ter as diversas do espaço e ""nature"" para natureza). Bom jogo para passar tempo e ainda por cima gratuito! Игра мне понравилась. Я люблю собирать пазлы. Особенно сложно собирать на харде, но это всё равно не сравнится с некоторыми пазлами из PP Ultimate. Огорчает только отсутствие ачивок.  6/10 Thank you for this. I really enjoy space pics and puzzles, so this was a real treat. Easy level was glitchy at first cause if another piece was already where the correct piece goes, once I put it there, the wrong piece would STICK there. Would be nice to be able to connect pieces off the grid. I hope you make another one of these. Perhaps with animated gifs of NASA visualizations? ⣾⡇⣿⣿⡇⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣄⢻⣦⡀⠁⢸⡌⠻⣿⣿⣿⡽⣿⣿ juégalo

974920,New Adult Reality,"Very limited. Needs more activities. more commands. a better location with more rooms. Also get the kids off the walls. Despite what the store page says, this game requires a VR headset."
942760,Burnout Drift,"Do not buy this game. The screenshots make this look like Forza Horizon 4 but it actually looks like a mobile game being run on 2 FPS. I can't believe i actually spent money on this crap. Oyun çöp. Para kazanması ve drift puanı elde etmesi aşırı zor. Optimizasyon sorunları mevcut.
Araç çeşitliliği yok. 4 araç var. İnsan AE86, Skyline, Tofaş, Mercedes vesaire koyar. Araçlara desen ekleme ve Online özellikte gelmeli. Daha fazla harita gelmeli. Initial D için ideal bu oyun.



Buğra abi Allah'ını seveyim güzel oyun var elinde değerlendir şu oyunu. Potansiyeli yüksek piyasada ki çoğu drift oyunundan iyi ama eksikleri fazla. oyunun hassasiyet bok gibi you can get better car games for free Скачивайте если только бесплатно! поиграл 10 мин, пишу отзыв и нафиг удаляю!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! um jogo simples, divertido e barato kiedy będzie wsparcie kierownic i padów?
 First off let's get this clear, if you buy this because it looms nice, you will be disappointed, as the car you drive is the only somewhat nice texturing.

The cars honestly have terrible handling and feel like the wheels are made of ice. The maps are fun for the first time you play them, but once you finish the 3 only maps, the novelty wears off fast. This game aint worth it man. The only advantage of this game is drift practicing in terms of accurate timing and proper balance of turning and speeding until it becomes a habit. I think this would be better by using a simulator drive wheel. However, there is an unnecessary high texture of the background scenery that slows the game play even in low quality. Whats more, it's extremely difficult that you have a narrow space to maneuver around traffic with a high probability of losing all gained multiplied score points if a single touch happened to the car (sounds like glass breaking) which is a frustrating thing. It could've reduced some points from the score rather than cancelling. That's in addition to the few number of available tracks and the useless options for car suspension and tire adjustment. Один из лучших симуляторов дрифтинга за свои деньги I paid $4.50 for this game. And I truly believe that the developers spent that much to produce this game. It's incredibly simplistic. Cars and tracks are extremely limited, and there's been no progression on the game or any communication from the developers since the games release. I believe this was an attempt to make a quick buck. Anyone who purchased this game just threw their money away. Shame. So many small developers are doing this now. God knows how this game made it on to Steam. I'm quickly losing faith with them as well. Unoptimized as Hell.
And doesn't look that ""good"" as on the pictures.
(Also not fun at all) Me ha impresionado el movimiento de los vehículos los escenarios y el movimiento de drift es impresionante para estar echo con el motor gráfico Unity esta impresionante, el creador del juego sabia lo que hacia desde el primer momento y sabia lo que las personas querían un movimiento fácil fluido y a 60 fps :D Impresionante lo recomiendo para pasar el rato y viciárte 

PD: El escenario del garaje me recuerda muchísimo al dríver 1 de psx  así que por eso le doy un +1 :D ? Отвратительный дрифт :((( Норм игра,но графика не доработана 游戏很不错
但我觉得价格有点偏高
建议6-24￥
 Ich muss schon sagen für diesen kleinen Preis, kriegt man richtig was geboten.
Das Gameplay ist halt Typisch Dritstyle, ihr habt unterschiedliche Maps, auf denen ihr euer können auf die Probe stellt.
Es ist wirklich was für zwischendurch, da sich die Drift Runden auf Zeit beschränken könnt ihr genüsslich zwischendurch mal die reifen durchdrehen lassen.
Ziel ist es so viele Punkte wie möglich in einer Runde zu machen, ABER erhofft euch kein leichtes Gameplay.
Also ihr werdet es nicht schaffen mit eurem ersten Auto gleich dicke Punkte ab zu räumen. 

Ich hab jetzt das zweite Musle Car, und wie ich es mir dachte, jedes Auto hat seine vorhergesehene Map wo das volle Potenzial ausgereizt werden kann. Und so könnt ihr step by steb eure Kombos und somit den Highscore knacken.

Erst mit dem zweiten Auto habe ich es über die 30000 geschafft. Also bis man den höchsten Higscore geknackt hat, muss man sich paar Autos erspielen, damit es überhaupt möglich ist.

Ihr könnt eure Autos anpassen, Tieferlegen, Reifen justieren etc, um die Autos etwas an die Maps an zu passen, aber ich habe da jetzt noch nicht viel unterschied feststellen können. 
Also es wirkt für mich eher kosmetisch, so viel habe ich da aber jetzt auch noch nicht rum probiert. 

Im großen und ganzen bin ich sehr zufrieden mit dem Spiel und es wurde Grafisch sowie vom Gameplay sehr gut umgesetzt, so das es tatsächlich Spaß macht.

Aber ich habe da kleine Mankos die mich persönlich stören. 

-- Die Einstellungsmöglichkeiten 
Es gibt nur Mastersound und Musiksound was es ziemlich öde macht, wenn man nur den Soundtrack hören will.
 
-- Kollision mit anderen Autos und Leitplanken 
Wenn es zur Kollision kommt, dann wird man zurückgeworfen wie ein Gummiball, und wenn man erst mit der Leitplanke kollidiert, dann klebt man förmlich dran wie Sekundenkleber, und es geht extrem viel Zeit flöten. 
Vielleicht ist es bewusst so gewollt, um direkt zu beginn Optimales driften zu lernen, aber wenn es passiert dann wird es schnell lästig. 

-- Punkte und Combo Counter
Ich bin noch nicht ganz dahinter gekommen, aber von anderen Spielen kenne ich es so: 
Drift fängt an. Der Punkte Zähler fängt auch sofort an. Bei Burnout Drift ist dem nicht der Fall...
Beispiel: Drift fängt an, 3 Sekunden später fängt erst der Punkte Zähler an.
Ob die Punkte trotzdem mit gezählt werden bleibt mir unklar.
Auch ist der Combocounter etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig, denn bei anderen Spielen fängt der nach der Kurve an, und endet bei einer Kollision, oder läuft ab.
Bei Burnout Drift, scheint sich der Combocounter erst nach einer gewissen Driftdauer zu 
erhöhen. 

So ganz aktiv lässt sich der Counter aber nicht beobachten, da das Driften relativ authentisch gehalten ist, und man hier auch wirklich aufpassen muss. 
Also im großen und ganzen bin ich sehr zufrieden, und es macht auch tatsächlich Spaß, da kann ich meine persönlichen Mankos auch verkraften, da ich die Combos eh knacken werde mit jedem neuem Auto, und von Runde zu Runde wird es besser und schneller. 

Fazit: klare Empfehlung viel Spaß zum kleinen Preis da kann man sich nicht beschweren.

1382870,World War Academy,"挺有意思的游戏，一个大地图上双方激战，抄起枪就开干了！操作还是CS那一套，上手挺容易（除了购买装备的快捷键）。
有一些有趣而坑人的设定，比如突然天黑了，突然大雾来了。。。明明你拿着枪瞄准好了，然后突然什么都看不到了，然后可能就被送回去了，很适合多人开怼的一款游戏。。
这个游戏貌似是一个人独立开发的，实力强悍啊。。目前游戏中还有一些不合理的设定（其实很好玩），但是整体已经很优秀了，随着作者的更新应该会日臻完善的。
希望有更多人战友加入"
2446920,Gorgon Shield,"核心機制很有趣，要控制方位與效果並分配合理的角色去特定位置
但是沒有更多的衍伸機制，蠻可惜的
而且又放入一些很怪的小遊戲
像是迷宮這種完全不知道在幹嘛的東西
時間緊湊，沒跑出去還會被擺渡人直接秒殺
角色的相似度也過高 沒有拿到新角色的新鮮感 Depuis petit, j'ai toujours aimé les jeux de Whiskeybarrel Studios et celui ne fait pas exception !!
C'est ce genre de jeu symphatique qui manque alors merci !

J'espère un jour avoir une occasion de travailler avec vous en tant que compositeur. :D nice rogue elements, easy to understand controls and game mechanics. Short description:
You have a party of up to 4 heroes, each on their section of an elevator shield that can be rotated to assign hero to a different quarter.
Each quarter can be: defending the elevator shield from incoming monsters, healing, finding gold, ...
Each floor lasts for a given time (like a TD wave).
You typically have to rotate to heal a given hero, or loot if your best melee hero is also the best at looting, and no opponent is there at the moment...
But more often than not, choosing the right hero for the right task will force you to make very suboptimal compromises with the other (like putting the mage in melee so that your frontline fighter can heal).
After your party demise, you can use the gold found to purchase permanent improvements.

It is a ""small light game"", but I found it hard to put down, and I liked the twist on the TD/autobattle formula.
 When I got the game I wasn't really expecting to get too into it, but I was wrong: It is quite addicting.

I have played quite a few other roguelites, but none with this specific set of features. The game is sort of a tower defense, revolving around the concept of having up to 4 units standing in each side of a platform which you'll spin based on the current state of things: Maybe you need to heal a unit, maybe one is good with ranged damaged and you want to position it accordingly or maybe one that does high damage through AoE skills doesn't really have the defense to tank enemy hits and you want them safe, etc.

The game has a few issues:
- Some crashes here and there which make you lose the progress on your run (but at least save your gold and runes);
- Some UI elements seem to give incorrect information:
  * The option to ""increase agility"" states it would take 0.5 seconds off your ranged attack cool down, but it actually takes only 0.1;
  * When choosing a path between towers you're shown which doorways you'll encounter in the way, but that information apparently does not reflect the ones that actually show up.

None of the issues I found were bad enough that they would ruin the experience though.

Overall, I think Gorgon Shield is a pretty fun indie title and it deserves your attention. overall its a fun game but it has crashes so i have to give it a thumbs down until crashes are fixed, or at least a soft save point so you don't lose an entire damn run 太白癡了 每次玩到一定關卡就閃退 A very unique and fun little roguelite game! It's got a satisfying game loop with lots of player choice in upgrade, character loadouts, great sound effects, and epic arcade-style music with an announcer's booming voice encouraging you on.

It's short (took me around 5 hours to beat the first time), but there's plenty of replayability in trying out different builds and seeing what works well.

This game does suffer from several issues though. Elaborated on below:

The UI is can get quite buggy, with the tutorial itself even having some UI bugs when pausing during it, and upgrades not registering correctly and upgrading the wrong hero or building. 

The game is badly optimized. This is the dev's first go at a 3D game in the Godot Engine, and it kinda shows. The performance optimization is really not good - my laptop is 7 years old with an integrated GPU, which isn't modern but certainly not ancient - yet the game absolutely chugs at times at 10 - 20 FPS. Tinkering with settings doesn't help any either, no matter how much I turn off or lower fancy effects. This doesn't look like the kinda game that should demand a performant GPU (it's pixel graphics with 3D imposters using 2D pixel textures), though I understand making high-speed 3D games in Godot can be a challenge, having attempted it before myself.

Finally, increasing characters base level (one of the main meta progression ways to get stronger) is very  poorly designed. Character stats are allocated in random areas depending on the additional levels you've earned, when I would really like to choose for myself how to allocate the extra starting stats a character gets, like how it happens inside the Tower. This means getting optimal starting stats (like high starting strength on a high level gladiator) means rerolling again and again until you get the stats you want. Combined with the game lagging quite badly on the upgrade menu's, this gets really annoying very fast.

Finally, the game can crash mid-run semi-frequently. Not the worst, since runs are short and you keep the currencies earned from the run, but still annoying to run into.

Despite all these issues, Gorgon Shield is addictive and fun! Highly recommended, especially for the cheap price point. (though again, beware if your GPU is bad otherwise it might be an unpleasant experience) 很无聊 The game has crashed multiple times in my short play time, to the point where I can't even finish a run.  And the developers don't even try to fix the source of the crashes.  They built a message into the game so when you log in after crashing, it says, ""whoops, looks like your last run crashed, but we saved your gold for you; you're welcome.""  Skip this game. The game is pretty good for what it delivers, it could be longer and have more gameplay, more levels/more upgrades and upgrade levels but overall I am happy with the experience.

I wish Oliver Joyce, much luck with his future games! Zagrałem w tą grę, z uwagi na to iż jest ot nowe ip od twórcy sword and sandals. Niestety po ograniu gry niemógłbym jej polecić z uwagi na optymalizację gry, gdzie potrafi chrupnąć dość często. Potrafiła mi już parę razy się wyłączyć samoistnie podczas nieprawidłowego ruchu tarczą. Najbardziej op mechaniką w tej grze jest zwiększanie statystyk pod inteligencje i agility, gdyż za zabicie z łuku dostajesz 2XP, a za broń białą 1XP.  Jeszcze dodać trzeba do łuku że agility też ma ogromne znaczenie w zdobywaniu expa na łuku, gdyż na jednym polu jak postać strzeli 2 razy, to jak jednym ciosem zabije za 2xp, to ten drugi strzał z łuku da 1xp pomimo tego że przeciwnik zdechł i można taką jedną turą zdobyć 4xp. Shield też jest nieco zbugowany, bo po 3 sekundach do końca wyłącza expa, przez co jak zabijesz rywala w tych trzech ostatnich sekundach, to niedostajesz expa. Wybór postaci też niema żadnego znaczenia bo gra ma z góry ustalony schemat walki z bossami, czyli na zielonym ładujesz agility i inteligencje, na czerwonym siłe, hp i opcjonalnie agility, a niebieski i żółty są poprostu workami cementu, aby osłaniać shielda. Mam nadzieję żę w przyszłości jakby powstała kontynuacja to te błędy które wymieniłem zostaną naprawione. Лютейшая залипаловка. Фишка этой игры - нахождение героев на вращающейся платформе. Из-за этого нужно подбирать нужные позиции для лучшего позиционирования. Со временем появятся враги разных цветов, а персонажи того же цвета будут наносить монстрам повышенный урон. Разные персонажи, с разными способностями помогут лучше пройти уровни. Минус только отсутствие русского языка, а так за такие деньги просто хорошая игра Nice chill game I liked it. I was fortunate enough to receive a key for free im glad I did, its a fun unique game, took me a while to understand but ultimately am not good at it, but its one of those games you wanna keep picking up and doing another run.

(매일 업데이트되지는 않으며, 작성자가 원할 때마다 업데이트됩니다.)

[1일차]
고르곤의 방패에 탑승한 상태로 탑을 오르는 게임입니다.
방패는 좌우 회전이 가능하며 이에 따라서 영웅들의 위치도 변경시킬 수 있죠.
초기에는 1명의 영웅으로 시작하여 4개 방위를 홀로 담당해야하지만, 특정 층에 오를때마다 최대 영웅의 수가 증가하고 탑 밖 도시의 술집에서 새로운 영웅을 고용해 같이 모험을 떠날 수 있게 됩니다.

방패 위 4개 방위에는 특정 플랫폼들이 존재하며, 해당 위치의 영웅들의 플랫폼을 이용합니다.
가장 중요한 곳은 몬스터들이 다가오는 곳이며, 몬스터를 막지 못하면 방패가 공격당하고 내구도가 0이 되어버리면 그대로 게임 오버가 되어버리죠.
배치된 영웅은 몬스터를 저지하면서 전투를 진행하고, 원거리 플랫폼이 존재하면 이곳의 영웅이 전투를 돕기도 합니다.
외에도 영웅들이 보유한 스킬이나 방패 스킬을 발동시켜 전투를 도울 수도 있고, 제한된 시간동안 몬스터를 막아내면 클리어하여 다음 층으로 이동할 수 있죠.

외에도 영웅의 체력을 회복하는 플랫폼도 존재하고 방패를 수리하는 플랫폼, 추가 골드를 얻을 수 있는 보물상자 플랫폼도 존재합니다.
각 플랫폼에 위치한 상태에서는 액션 게이지가 채워질때마다 수행되며, 색깔 플랫폼의 경우 이 수행 속도가 빠르게 진행되죠.
동일한 플랫폼이 2개 이상 등장하는 경우도 존재하며 이에 따라 다수의 골드를 얻을 수도 있지만, 몬스터가 2곳에서 등장해 방어 난이도가 올라가는 경우도 존재합니다.

전투를 진행하면서 경험치를 획득하여 레벨업을 할 수 있습니다.
생존한 영웅 중 레벨업 대상을 1명 선택하고 4가지 보상 그룹 중 하나를 고를 수 있죠.
스킬 강화의 경우에는 새로운 스킬을 획득하거나 보유한 스킬을 강화시킬 수 있고 특성 강화에서는 4가지 스탯 중 하나를 선택해 올릴 수 있습니다.
기타 보너스에서 영웅의 체력이나 방패의 내구도 회복, 골드 수집이 가능하고 아이템 획득으로 랜덤한 장비를 선택하여 장착하거나 교체할 수도 있죠.

층을 오르다보면 2개의 상점 중 하나를 선택해야하는 층도 등장합니다.
상점은 보통 골드를 소모하여 이용 가능하며, 체력을 회복하는 곳도 있고 장비를 획득하는 곳, 영웅의 능력을 상승시켜주는 상점들이 존재하죠.
특정 상점에서는 아무런 요구없이 보상을 지급해주는 경우도 존재하지만, 생존한 영웅의 영혼을 요구하는 경우도 존재합니다.

마지막으로 탑의 최상층에 위치한 보스에게 도전하기 위해서는 미궁을 돌파하여야 합니다.
미궁 내부에서는 상하좌우로 이동이 가능하며, 제한 시간 내에 탈출구를 찾아내야 하죠.
돌아다니면서 열쇠를 얻어 잠겨진 곳을 오픈하고 보물도 찾고 몬스터와 싸우기도 합니다.
제한된 시간이 종료되면 사신이 등장하여 추격해오며 그에게 죽지 않도록 최대한 빨리 출구를 찾아내야하죠.

미궁을 돌파하면 탑의 최고층의 보스에게 도전할 수 있게 됩니다.
보스는 높은 체력과 공격력, 특별한 공격 능력을 보유하고 있기에 체력 관리가 꽤나 중요합니다.
자칫 잘못하면 영웅이 사망하게 되고 모두 전멸하거나 방패가 파괴되어버리면 그대로 게임 오버가 되어버리죠.
보스 처치에 성공하면 탑을 클리어하여 다음 탑으로 이동할 수 있게 됩니다.
2개의 탑 중 하나를 고를 수 있고, 탑의 속성과 등장하는 상점, 몬스터 종류를 확인한 뒤 도전할만하다 생각되는 탑을 골라 이동하면 되죠.

외에도 랜덤하게 퀘스트가 발생하여 수락 여부를 묻기도 합니다.
일정 수치의 대미지 주기, 방패 돌리지 않기, 모두 피해 받기, 골드 수집 등의 퀘스트가 주어지며 수락 후 성공하면 보상을 얻을 수 있죠.
수락하지 않으면 그냥 넘어가지만, 만약 수락 후 실패하면 골드를 잃게 됩니다.

그렇게 탑을 오르고 오르다가 결국 방패가 파괴당하면 모험이 종료되며 탑 외부로 쫒겨나게 되죠.
탑 외부에서는 보유한 골드를 소모하여 도시의 건물들을 건설하고 이용할 수 있게 됩니다.
술집에서는 새로운 영웅들을 고용할 수 있고 마차에서는 장신구를 구매하여 전투 플랫폼이나 도시 관련 효과를 강화시킬 수 있죠.
용광로에서는 방패의 룬 슬롯을 오픈하고 보유한 룬을 세기거나 교체를 할 수 있고 오벨리스크에서는 적의 능력을 감소시키거나 증가시켜서 난이도를 조정할 수 있습니다.
학교에서는 각 영웅들의 초기 레벨을 상승시킬 수 있는대, 탑을 오르기 전 영웅을 배치할때 상승한 레벨만큼 랜덤한 스탯이 상승하게 되죠.

정비를 하고 다시 탑을 도전하기 전에 보유한 영웅들로 방패 위의 영웅들을 배치하여야 합니다.
일정 층에 도달함으로써 최대 4명의 영웅들을 배치할 수 있게 되고, 술집에서 고용된 영웅들로 파티를 구성할 수 있죠.
배치 위치에 따라서 고유 속성이 정해지며, 영웅 종류가 적거나 도전과제를 위해 동일한 클래스의 영웅들을 중복하여 배치할 수도 있습니다.

[2일차]
용광로에서는 방패에 룬을 세기는 것 외에 룬 합성도 가능합니다.
동일한 룬 3개를 합성하여 상위 룬으로 제작할 수 있으며, 룬의 등급이 높을수록 효과가 상승하죠.

목사 등의 영웅들은 대미지 면역 스킬을 배울 수 있습니다.
발동 시, 유지 시간동안 대미지에 면역이 되는대 이를 잘 활용하면 보스전을 피해없이 클리어할 수 있죠.
2명 이상의 영웅에게 이 스킬을 배우게 하고 레벨업 보상으로 유지 시간을 증가시키는 옵션을 선택합니다.
보스전이나 1개의 전투 플랫폼만 있을때 1명으로 대미지 면역을 부여하고 효과가 종료되면 다른 친구를 배치하고 효과가 종료되면 다시 첫번째 친구를 배치하는 방식이죠.
타이밍을 맞추지 않거나 특정 스킬들에 의한 변수만 아니면 시간은 좀 오래 걸리지만 큰 피해없이 클리어가 가능합니다.

[아쉬운 점]
-대부분의 선택이 즉시 처리가 되어서 의도치않게 골드를 소모하는 경우가 가끔 있음
-술집에서 영웅 고용 시, 능력등을 확인할 수 없음
-배속 없음
-레벨업 외 장비 보상 획득 시, 장비의 종류에 대한 안내나 영웅들의 장비 상태를 파악할 수 없음
-텍스트 UI들의 우선순위가 좀 이상함 (플랫폼 실행 정보는 위의 캐릭터 정보에 가려지는대 딱히 필요없는 대사는 위의 캐릭터 상태 정보를 가려버림) I love the randomness which makes every run different from each other Keeps crashing and deleted my save 3 times now. Would refund if not past the 2 hour time limit.

Edit: Changed my review to positive because the dev seems great. Sigma"

1 способность - облако пороха,которое может взорваться,если ты сам активируешь или если твой союзник использует что то взрывное(например огненный шар или сюрикены огненные) хорошо для контроля местности,но минус в том,что в воздухе увы сделать нельзя(ну на самом деле можно,но тебе нужно ждать 10 секунд и только тогда получиться,но ты скорее всего за это время провалишься в пропасть) 
2 способность - я его назову ""огненный клон пулемет"" - очень крутая способность,можно использовать на любых поверхностях и в воздухе, также стреляет очередями маленькими огненными шарами,также накладывает эффект огня. эта способность не бесполезна,можно использовать как и в обычных замесах,так и защита точки,флагов и тд.
И ульта - призыв Энры(по факту обезьянка) значит на полу создает печать, и кто наступит на эту печать будет запечатан/запечатана и когда активируешь дзюцу,то из пола вылезает рука,сжимает врага и убивает полностью.
Наставник хороший,Конохомару и Темари вышли годными,а вот Мадара 6 путей - сомнительно.
В принципе рекомендовать могу,но способности не для комба. I dont have his Burning Ash jutsu but i have everything else which is pissing me off, and i hope they fix it.
 unbalanced, these overpowered jutsu needs at least a 22-second cooldown. it also redirects ultimates towards the bot instead of the actual player. i don't understand why they made the character more op than naruto. do you people not test your product and think ""you know what, i wonder if this would be unfair for the other players"". *fix your game*
 the techniques are deleted with the maintenance they did I still have the dlc but I can't use the techniques I hope they solve this problem KONOHAMARU GELDİ BABA MUH-TE-ŞEM YAA OKUYUN ABİİİ

Fire Style: Flaming Meteors: Arkadaşlar Bu Jutsu herhangi bir kalkan kırmıyor ve bloklanabilir bir jutsudur. Ancak Komboya başlamadan önce bu jutsuyu atarsanız ve adama saldırırsanız, siz saldırırken arkanızdan gelen katonlar ile güzel bir damage çıkartırsınız. Havaya bir adet Kage Bunshin bırakıp 3 kere 3'erli Katon atıyoruz. Jutsu tam olarak bu. Aşağı düşmeli Maplerde adamları Pitfall yapabilirsiniz.

Bu DLC'ye Puanım: 8/10 Спасибо тебе за всё игра...
Наставник хороший, о его техниках проще узнать через ютуб, они хороши и подойдут под многие билды.
Но вот как мне мириться с тем, что я не получил техник, вернее я получил, но у меня их забрали при этом оставили его посох, причёску и титул. 
До момента как у меня пропали техники, я успел с ними спокойно поиграть, но зайдя в игру буквально через пару часов я их лишился, даже ульты нету...
Я наиграл в эту игру больше 900 часов, но такая проблема у меня впервые и я не знаю как исправлять эту ошибку, я безумно чувствую себя обманутым своей любимой игрой. Надеюсь на то, что это пофиксят в течении дня. You guys did an update and now i don't have access to any of the new jutsus. Моему восторгу нет придела... невероятно апупительно крутые техники по своей механике и задумке!!!

1скил: создает клона который без твоего участия поливает противника шквалом огненных шаров позволяя грамотнее вести бой
2скил: выпускает дым в сторону противника которой временно обездвиживает цель и дает возмоность начать рукопашный бой а если что-то идет не так можно это облако дыма поджечь и взорвать нанеся урон и откидывая врагов для отступления
Ульта: Цепляет к врагам по близости маленьких обезьянок которые замедляют и не дают сделать подмену и при повторном нажатии призывает огромную руку что наносит урон

НО! наставник однозначно обязателен к покупке ведь имеет очень крутые ниндзюцу в арсенале!!! дальность стрельбы у клона слишком большая, для класса ""атака"", напоминает ""Четки Ясака"" у Итачи возрожденного Наставник очень хорош. Техники интересные, особенно катон: пылающие метеоры. meh"
2765200,我被古装美女包围了！,"不推荐，同题材中很粗制滥造的存在。 The story is short, but quite unique.
One thing that I think is lacking in this story is actually in the concept. Monologue. Playing this game feels a bit empty because the main character doesn't speak at all, just need two-way interaction.

Note: If you have any VR headset, it's highly recommended. Superlative experience... ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⡠⠐⠊⠁⠀⢀⣀⣀⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠑⠒⠢⢄⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠉⠁⠈⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ This might be worth playing in VR but not in regular 2D. It is boring, short, unfinished and it lacks appealing interactions. The narrative almost has the bones of something decent: you’re thrown back in time as a lowly servant, but due to great poetry skills, you gain fame. However, becoming famous is skipped over, so the zero-to-hero arc is unsatisfying.

The player-character has no voice over (not a problem) but he barely responds during exchanges. There are rarely any meaningful choices and too many identical scenes. Strangely, unlocked bonus scenes appear at the end of chapters. The three admirers don’t get much screen time, so it is not even worth evaluating them. Some male characters (e.g. the butler) are annoying and take up too much of the story. The only real positives are the sets and costumes.

It will take just over an hour to finish and an hour more to unlock all scenes, which is much shorter than average. The game’s price is very low, which may justify the length, but the story is unfinished. You get to the end and when you would normally pick an admirer it loops back to the start again. So the romances are incomplete. No, actually they never even get started. Video quality is okay, but there is some fish-eye distortion. Audio is ADR heavy, but not the worst. English translation is fine. If this style appeals then you are better off with ‘Rebirth! New lover’, even though that game was far from perfect. Fué muy divertido, como ver una telenovela interactiva. La historia es simple y corta, pero está bien contada y la Realidad Virtual añade un gran toque de inmersión. Algo que si noté en la versión de RV es que la calidad no es muy buena, y es complicado leer los subtítulos, pero ser golpeado en la cara es genial en RV. 
Super recomendado, y espero una secuela. No podría elegir entre las tres aún pero definitivamente quiero más! An interesting and clever Story, I look forward to experiencing the rest of it. I would like to be able to have more choices during each chapter's dialogues though, seeing as how this game explores so many personality traits and emotions. Thank You It good but it too short. Please make a sequel for it to make it compete and also add more choice such as punching all those douchebag we have to face This game was fun, although I had to be quick at reading subtitles :) [h2]I'm Surrounded by Classical Beauties! (VR - you can act with the actors)[/h2]
I played this game in both VR and non-VR. Since it's designed for VR, this review is based on the VR gaming experience. The VR market is small, mainly developed by indie developers. Players also tend to engage in VR for shorter periods compared to PC gaming, preferring immersive experiences over extended gaming sessions. The length of this game is acceptable for an FMV VR experience. The most impressive part of this game in VR is the feeling of actually being inside the FMV and being able to act alongside the actors.

[h3]The Story :[/h3]
The story begins with you accidentally traveling through time to ancient times in He mansion. There, you meet three ancient beauties who aid you. The story of this game is quite interesting and fun in VR as you play the role of an ancient scholar and with the use of various motions as responses/options makes it much more immersive than just picking an option; it feels like you're truly involved in acting within the game in VR. The only drawback is the absence of the male protagonist voice (I'm not going to voice it myself :P).

[h3]The Viewing Experience :[/h3]
Watching the cutscene in VR (3D 180°) offers a unique experience compared to a 2D flat screen. In VR, you have the freedom to explore different angles and focus on various elements, enhancing the visual appeal and allowing you to observe each actor's emotional responses closely, as well as the environment. This immersive experience means you can watch the same cutscene multiple times without getting bored, as each viewing unveils new details or perspectives to appreciate. Besides the speaking actors, the other actors also portray good emotional responses in this FMV, which are clearly visible in VR.

[h3]The Controls :[/h3]
In VR mode, when choosing a speaking option, you select the option that appears in front of you. However, there are other responses/actions that require various motions, such as giving a massage, looking away while the lady is undressing, slapping, punching, etc. You also always see your two hands, which enable you to act with your hands in the FMV. This is a very innovative design.

[h3]The Three Ancient Beauties :[/h3]
[b]Chunlan :[/b] Calm, peaceful, and caring (Taurus or Cancer) 
[b]Yuerong He :[/b] Hot-tempered but without hard feelings (Aries) 
[b]RuYue :[/b] Intelligent and righteous, she also tests your gentlemanly qualities (Aquarius)  

[h3]The Length and Ending :[/h3]
The short duration of this game might not satisfy PC gaming experience, but for VR, it offers a completely new experience that hasn't been seen before, and the duration as a VR experience is acceptable. However, there's a sense that the story's ending could have been more satisfying in both non-VR and VR.
The story concludes when you become [spoiler]the First Scholar and are asked to choose one of the three ancient beauties to accompany you to the imperial palaces. If you start over from Chapter 1, the three ancient beauties ask you this question, but you don't get to choose; the story restarts. This narrative is akin to the feeling of ""Unknown why you become a time traveler and keep repeating the timeline while losing your past memory."" Nonetheless, you remain unsatisfied without progressing to the imperial palaces and finding out why you have been traveling to ancient times.[/spoiler] However, it is an interesting story of being a time traveler journeying to ancient times, and players want to know more about why and what happens next.

[h3]The Score :[/h3]
[b]10/10 (unprecedented masterpiece in VR)[/b] FMV with various motions as responses/options is a unique experience that hasn't been seen before, it is a very great experience as you feel like you're acting in the FMV with the actors in VR. The acting, music, and story are all quite good, though it lacks a certain satisfaction at the end (deducted 1 point). This game stands as a VR FMV masterpiece (perhaps the best), but its appeal does not extend to 2D flat screen FMV on PC (especially the short length of 2-3 hours).

If you have a VR headset, don't miss out on this VR FMV! I hope it gains popularity and sells well in the VR market. Looking forward to a sequel or DLC exploring the journey of the three ancient beauties to the imperial palaces. 说是史都是轻的，根本不知道这个游戏想表达什么。一天到晚的搁那吟诗作对就算了，最最最气人的是，无论你选什么别人都会称赞你，那到底要玩家来干什么？ 這個遊戲要用VR玩才有趣, 內容品質很不錯, 演技沒問題 I liked it when miss He wanted to spank me. She looked like she would like it too.

Ending was abrupt and confusing. Future story? good [h1]A Unique Take on an FMV Game[/h1]
A friend gifted me this game, eager to hear my thoughts, and now I shall share my experience.

Having completed the game with 100% achievements, I feel confident in providing an in-depth review that will hopefully answer any questions you may have.

[h3]The Story[/h3]
The narrative is somewhat fragmented. Set in ancient China, you begin with no memory of how you arrived there and must progress from a servant to the #1 scholar in the country. While the story is generally coherent and easy to follow, an inexplicable time travel scene near the beginning—lasting about 15 seconds—remains unaddressed and unexplained throughout the game.

[h3]The Characters[/h3]
Waifu is [b]Chunlan[/b], she is the only character who genuinely seems to care for you for understandable reasons. 
Also mentioning [b]Master He[/b], your best friend, who is a consistently pleasant character to interact with.

The acting in this game is commendable, especially considering its apparent low budget. The actors and actresses are fully committed to their roles, convincingly portraying people from ancient China, through actions, dialect or mannerism.

[h3]The World[/h3]
The most impressive aspect of this game is its breathtaking sets and backdrops. The Chinese designs are among the most beautiful I’ve seen in an FMV game, creating an immersive experience that truly feels like a journey back in time. The clothing and hairstyles are meticulously accurate to the period, adding to the authenticity. The traditional Chinese music enhances the atmosphere, making each song a delight to hear.

[h3]The Translation[/h3]
The English translation is clear and quite impressive. A significant part of the game involves couplet poetry, which is translated flawlessly, maintaining its meaning and elegance in English. However, the subtitles can be too quick, especially during written segments, requiring frequent pauses to read fully.

[h3]The VR Experience[/h3]
One of the standout features of this game is its VR compatibility, which significantly enhances the immersion. The VR experience makes you feel as though you are physically present in ancient China, interacting directly with the characters. This level of immersion brings the beautifully designed sets and authentic costumes to life, creating a truly unique and engaging experience that I have never seen before in a FMV game.

[h3]The Ending (No Spoilers)[/h3]
The ending feels abrupt and unfinished, as if the budget constraints forced an early conclusion. The story lacks closure, with no resolution for the characters' romantic or friendship arcs. It feels as though the game abruptly ends without providing the necessary chapter to wrap up the story or explain the initial time travel scene (I still have no idea why it was added).

[h3]Final Thoughts[/h3]
Despite its short duration—around two hours to complete, with an additional two hours to achieve 100%—I enjoyed my time with this game. It is very affordable, making it a worthwhile purchase. The developers clearly poured a lot of love and effort into this project, and I hope they can create a slightly longer games in the future to fully flesh out new stories.

[h3]Message to Onetake_Studio[/h3]
The game is fantastic, and offering it at such a low price is a great strategy to attract more players. My advice for future projects is to ensure the story doesn't leave players hanging. Gamers need closure to feel their time was well spent. Nonetheless, it was a very enjoyable game, and I thank you for creating it.

Rating: 6.5/10

[b]Recommended![/b] got punched several times, i enjoyed it 从来没玩过这么潦草的游戏，颜值颜值不够，剧情剧情不行，结尾就像是赶工期一样结束，我是没想到我Steam第一个评论居然是给这个游戏打差评！！！！！！！！！ thời lượng trò chơi khá ít, nhưng với giá tiền như vậy thì hợp lý, kỳ vọng chương tiếp theo và hy vọng bổ sung thêm tiếng việt
 Some aspects could be improved for sure. But nice overall, would recommend, especially at its price.
Why is the achievement locked on VR play though? Chunlan is Waifu.

This game is very affordable and while much shorter than most other FMV games, it is still a very enjoyable 2 hour or so experience. It also has the unique feature of being VR compatible if that is how you want to play it. While I wouldn't call the story particularly unique or detailed in Cdrama terms, there really isn't many games /like/ this in this more historical time period, so its definitely a treat if you do like FMV and light hearted Chinese historical dramas. 

Maybe it is just my mix of flags I collected while going through the story, but it didn't feel like it had much of an ending (unless its a hidden ending, I may try to rearrange my route a bit to see what I can find later), but the journey is still enjoyable and I would love to see the company make another FMV like this but in more detail in the future.

Also this FMV surprisingly has some of the best English translations I have seen in a Chinese FMV. The game relies a lot on couplet poetry, which shouldn't translate well to English, but the translations are both easy to understand and actually feel like reasonable choices when you pick them. As I have said, for the price you really won't be disappointed.

感謝你們製作這個遊戲並提供英文字幕，希望你們以後繼續製作這樣的遊戲。
 VR玩家可以入，电脑慎重。
1.短到我以为试玩版，为什么买之前不说清楚没有后续剧情，为什么买之前不说明需要分好几部，这样前期刚过就结束了的短剧感很无语，强迫症很不舒服。
2.彩蛋解锁什么的太繁琐，需要反复尝试剧情，也没一点提示，第四章的还剩几个莫名其妙不知道怎么解也没有攻略。那么多选项真的懒得一个一个试了，太累了。"
940330,BBlocks,"game of the year 10/10 ☀️ идеальная игра. fdp Best game ever! BBlocks is a simple 2D Tetris ripoff ""made"" by asset flippers, Softwaves Mini, from Brazil.

This is a basic tetris game, there's no full screen option, the quality is deplorable and has all the hallmarks of an asset flip. It's garbage, of course, and you can play tetris online free in web browser, so it's impossible to recommend anyone should buy this. Falling Blocks is still the best rendition of Tetris on Steam, but this takes a close second. шедевр не ваши там метро исход ;) there is no T piece 10/10 Pluses:
+ This is probably the closest that Steam has ever come to Atari Tetris
Minuses:
- Game is not long enough. This has only 3 levels while the original was endless
- Minor inaccuracies within the rotation system such as wall kicks going as far as 3 cells to the left as opposed to just 1 cell to the left

If more time was spent in development it would be harder to give this a thumbs down what if

1627720,Lies of P,"started it becouse i heard it looks like bloodborne, finished achivaments and now I'm sure i wanna buy sekiro next when i get money for it
 빨리 dlc줘요 현기증 나요 Hyped for the DLC. One of the best and most underrated games of ALL TIME 操作手感一坨答辩 The game overall is great, but the initial part feels a bit clunky and can be frustrating. It certainly is a learning curve, the game will be pretty challenging even for Souls veterans.
SOME boss attacks are a bit BS but become fun if you embrace the absurdity of it all.
If you're looking for a VERY fun game with exagerated bosses and presentation, look no further.

The story begins with ""ahah twink Pinocchio"" and ends with ""ahhh sweet, man made horrors beyond my comprehension"".

8.75/10 好 semplicemente fantastico. Uh... Ta bien, lo que recomendaria mucho probarlo antes. Ya que la comunidad de souls es muy tiquismisquis con segun que juegos.

Esteticamente me atrae, como bloodborne. Mecanicas pulidas de algunas entregas de souls y otras cosas que han sido utilizadas en elden ring.

Recomiendo encarecidamente que lo prueben antes de comprarlo, si saben de alguien que lo tengan o probarlo en el steam verde de miconoft.

Buena caza y parte madre de marionetas. 牛 감동적이고 재밌는 스토리...
오지는 타격감...
좋은 브금... 好玩 Lies of P ist eines wenigen Spiele, die es wirklich verdient haben so ein Positives Feedback zubekommen.
Das Spiel ist ein Soulslike Spiel was man auch deutlich zu spüren bekommt, welches aber sehr Positiv ist.
Die Generelle Geschichte im Spiel ist super, und der Endboss eine Extreme Herausforderung.
Das Design ist atemberaubend und wunderschön gemacht.
Was nicht ganz so gut war ist das Waffen System der Waffenherstellung, das gefällt mir nicht ganz so gut.

Dieses Spiel ist daher eine 9/10 und ich werde es in naher Zukunft aufjedenfall vor der dem Release von dem DLC nochmal Spielen. 別浪費時間 好玩 好玩，爱玩 还可以，原教旨魂系体验

剧情还没看完 italian sekiro Lies of P exhibits great craftsmanship in its production - from animations to graphical fidelity alongside the careful attention to detail in level visuals. The Belle Époque era makes for a beautiful steampunk pastiche and somehow the unorthodox choice of Pinocchio as inspiration for the narrative ended up working well. In terms of gameplay, the excellent balance of parrying, dodging, and blocking makes for solid core gameplay the likes of which rivals the genre king (FromSoftware). Further, the weapon/arm customization and the ""P organ"" [spoiler](get your mind out of the gutter!)[/spoiler] upgrade tree are great RPG accoutrements. Overall, it is simply a great game. 快慢刀简直了，每一个怪都搞个抬手几秒的慢刀和0.01秒的超快刀。
尤其是女武神拿把巨剑疯狗十三连考虑过你的人偶的性能吗。
二周目的小怪数值简直爆炸，随便一个小兵打你一招都是半管血，有多段攻击的直接回泉水
制作组把快要发行的DLC这些问题应该改一改吧 Originally played this on game pass when it first released. This game was very clearly made with love and care, especially the music. The art direction and atmosphere are wonderful and kept drawing me in throughout each chapter. The supporting characters aren't super deep, but all have enough subtle backstory to give them each their own bit of charm. Only steam game I went out of my way to get every achievement for, very worth the purchase."
2218090,For Goodness Sake,"Love it when a game makes me think - even better when it keeps me thinking after I've finished playing. Neat little game. Interesting to see where Krampus' values lie, and who he decides to punish. This short game was pretty solid. While it doesn’t have a lot of content, I’d still recommend giving it a try. It has that spooky, grainy atmosphere that really adds to the creepy vibe. This game was just what I needed for a short sit-down alone.
Great Horror WOULD RECOMMEND not a bad game very good. :) 10 out of 10. :) [b]Are you on the nice list this year?[/b]
[i]Only one way to be sure...[/i]
[i]Let's do some more chores![/i]
[b]The sound of jingle bells is near.[/b] A very short game but it's free so you can't complain that much. Has a nice but different graphic style reminds me of the first Terrifier movie it's a shame we didn't see Krampus but honestly a nice little Christmas horror game with some music that sets the tone nicely. This game does a really good job setting up a tense atmosphere without needing to jumpscare you. The questions were kind of tricky to get right, but it's doable. If I have one complaint the graphics are very hard on the eyes. I feel like making things just a little bit brighter would really help there. 
Otherwise it's a solid experience and a fine free game. ‎ Вырвиглазный визуальный стиль.

(6/10) Sufficiently creepy. I like the premise and execution. And thank you for no jump scares. I almost chickened out not two seconds in, but I can appreciate the ambiance now. Good work! ⠀ Eng:The game is intended for one time use only. just for one time………
Rus: Игра предназначена только для одноразового использования. только на один раз…… Santa is real. But Krampus is realer... Not bad, the ambiance was spooky being able to hear activity outside and around the house. The weird TV grain effect was a little obnoxious for my eyes so I wish I could have toned that way down. Pretty creepy and I liked the 2 endings pretty well. Good, free game! I thought this would be the belle of ball for a Free To Play Xmas Game Friday but it was kinda a snoozefest. 
I LIVE streamed it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zC610t0nVg Chat did not seem to be loving it, compared to other FTP games. 
The aesthetics are well done & the music is cool but it's just not scary & the choices presented sometimes don't make sense.
I guess for being created in 1 month & you have some extra time it's cool but I'd say skip this one otherwise. 
I will say I am looking forward to the Dead Letter Dept game though, wishlisted that!"
49311,Commander: Conquest of the Americas - Pirate Treasure Chest,"Arrg buy this no me hearty or walk the plank!  It be worth its weight in gold me boy! Greatly improves CotA, unfortunate the base game is simplistic. DLC for this game are really interesting, adding more random stuff to do.


This game is fun but become complicated after some hours of playing ,overall its a great game for all the trading possibility and the sea batlles.
Easy to handle , a lots of detailled ships , possibility to have lots of fleet for trading or batlle and possibility to set some ""automatic trading road, exactly like you want them.
Nice graphic both on the map and during sea battle.
The diplomacy is well done, so you can directly trade some material with the other nations, ask anyone to start/stop doing war and things like that.
You need money to rules safety, and it's fun to make the mission, (better with the DLC).
Still having a lots of fun trying to get the achievment and playing the tactical sea battle.

9/10 - maybe waiting for a 2017 version ? なぜ欧米人は海賊が大好きなのか。DLCや拡張で海賊要素を追加するのは基本中の基本。
しかし海賊を入れたくて入れたくて仕方なかったあまりバランス調整がおざなりにされた感がある。
海賊のファクション値上げて拿捕船を購入とか海賊提督を雇用とか一体誰が使うんだ。ちょっと上げても時間経過ですぐ落ちるので、多分1艦隊をひたすらヨーロッパの拠点とトルトゥガの海賊港を往復する作業に専従させないとまともに上げられない気がする。特に海賊提督を上手く使えそうな序盤にこれはきつい。
海賊港での仕入れは植民地の資源需要を満たすのに大変便利だけど、便利なだけにバランス壊してる気がする。
ただ有名海賊退治のミッションだけはなかなか良い。海賊の宝から入手したアーティファクトで植民地を強化できるのは面白い。
まあ海賊提督もがんばってファクション上げさえすればいろいろ面白い使い方ができそうだし悪くはない。
結論としては欧米人ばりに海賊が大好きなら買い。 I'm beginning to suspect that monchichi never actually meant happiness"
1006150,Urban Justice,"I wasn't crazy about this game.  It's super cheap (even cheaper now, being on sale), but even then there isn't any good reason to buy this.  There are far better 2d beat 'em up games on Steam that are fun to play and inexpensive.

Hard pass. It is okay as a demo or guinea pig for developer to practice coding. It is not okay as a video game product: repetitive, boring, mindless button mashing, AI is not existent. Urban Justice isn't quite disastrous, but it NEARLY is. The game design is braindead, because spamming jump-kick will solve every conflict with no issue. There only appears to be a single enemy type, the protagonists all control the same, and the storyline is a poor, watered down alternative to genre classics. If someone showed me Urban Justice and told me ""this is what beat 'em ups are"", I would wonder why anyone enjoyed the genre to begin with. [h1] Um excelente beat' em up. Só que não.  [/h1]

Falando sério agora, vou tentar resumir aqui esse jogo da maneira mais fácil possível. Apenas três fases/cenários é o que você vai encontrar. Todos na cidade e visualmente bem trabalhados até. Um modo história com três personagens jogáveis e quatro comandos de ação; soco, chute, pulo e bloqueio. Há também um modo chamado ""skirmish"" no qual você pode escolher um entre 12 personagens jogáveis, porém, a maioria desses personagens está bloqueada e é preciso comprar os bloqueados para ter acesso aos mesmos. Na promoção, esse jogo é quase de graça, e se você quiser conferir todos os personagens jogáveis, terá que repetir dezenas de vezes as mesmas pouquíssimas fases até arrecadar o dinheiro para desbloquear essa galera toda. É possível jogar online com um amigo, mas mesmo assim se você conseguir ficar duas jogando esse treco, significa que você realmente não tem nada de bom para fazer da sua vida. Talvez seja o meu caso. jugabilidad difícil para ser un juego casual. Se trata de un juego de Yo contra el Barrio... la trama es una chorrada presentada en forma de comic, distruibuida en 7 actos donde se repite una estructura de luchas con matones, dos saludes, 2 armas y boss final. Tipico. Pero entretenido.

Los controles se sienten bien, y son sencillos, puño, patada, salto patada, y cubrirte. Suficiente para pasarte un rato entretenido. Me han gustado bastante los gráficos y la gran variedad de personajes y enemigos ... poligonales, esbeltos, parcos en detalles y bonitos.

Total, que un juego de puños para un ratito, por unos centimos lo cumple y ayudas a un estudio. Si te van los juegos de pelea pues aqui tienes Urban justice.

 Habs gerade durchgespielt, macht sehr viel Spass !!! beat 'em up carino,non molto lungo,e abbastanza semplice,piacevole per chi ama giochi stile final fight e simili. Anche il prezzo e' molto ""ragionevole"",io l'ho preso a sconto a meno di 1 euro,,,, After streets of rage 3 and streets of rage 4 It was The BEST Beat em up Video game :D
Hey Developer Please Return back to this project!
The Bugs Are a few But it doesnt even matter the gameplay is nice.
For those people who are talking about assets.
Yes they are published but you have to pay for it and also I think they doesnt had a modeler for this game.
What This game needed :

Online Skirmish (It already has a local Skirmish u can play with your friend with one keyboard or one keyboard and joystick so dont worry for the joystick u both can play in one keyboard).

Online story.

Local Co-op story.

More stories.

More Characters.

What game already has : 
Skirmish ( Local co op and solo ) 
story mode( solo but I think one campaign can be co op too idk i'll edit it when i finished that.) 
Some cool characters that you can buy with coins that u earn in game (Skirmish and finishing one epsoide of story mode)
Some Cool enemies.
Cool combos
Cool songs and sound effects.
and i think its based on streets of rage

The only bad thing is this game isnt online and maybe 2- 4 local player support would make it better? 
Anyway 
I suggest it.
 Нет такой стандартной вещи для бит-ем апов как бросков, а также супертупые враги как зомби прут и практически не контр атакуют. Босы не запоминаются и ничем не отличаются от обычных ботов кроме размеров.
 Игра в легкую  проходится за 1 час. 
30 руб по скидке возможно и справедливая цена, но я бы заплатил бы в 10 раз больше, будь в ней больше разнообразия и исправленны вышесказанные недостатки.

Но вот что не могу простить игре, так это  невозможность настроить управление  по своему усмотрению.  Играем только тем, как нам раскидал по умолчанию клавиши разработчик. За это однозначный неуд. When I look back at my childhood beat-em-up games, the likes of street of rage, double dragon, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or even street figther 1 & 2, you know that feeling of excitement, never getting tired of replaying it and even pushing yourself to perform better. Best when you can't wait for your buddy to come over and play together? I felt [u]none[/u] of those here. 

At it's core, yes the fighting mechanics work great. Different characters have different fighting styles. You can also play co-op now but there are issues with the controls & controllers. Apart from that? Uninteresting gameplay. All I did was mash z and x key from start till the end. I bash up everything from chapter 1 to chapter 7. Nothing else and I didn't even know I was bashing up the ""final"" boss. What an anti-climax ending/pathetic boss fight. Poor concept/design choice. Skirmish mode? You continue to bash up everything by walking to and back (left and right) endlessly. Enemies are all generic dumb blocks. Might as well turn them into zombies. 

To say that you get inspiration from classics like final fight and streets of rage? and come out with this kind of product? i somewhat felt insulted. Those classics offered more. offered creativity and variety of enemies. Twist the gameplay. Had Cinematics. Had suspense and tension. Had epic boss fights. [b][u]No, you have no right to say that. This is far from what the classics offered! If you're going to put that in your product description, then you have to do A LOT MORE BETTER THAN THIS. [/u][/b] Awful control settings ! É realmente muito simples. Mas isso não seria problema se funcionasse corretamente. Tem péssimo suporte ao controle que do nada pára de responder. Pelo que li, basta reconectar que volta a funcionar, mas não vale a pena o esforço.

Passe longe!
 How do you know a politician is corrupt? When dollar bills spawns from the walls and ceiling of his office, of course!

Once more, I find myself wishing Steam had a neutral rating. The game  is't all bad. It has 3D-rendered graphics (in a chunky, PS1 sort of way). It has three playable characters. It has cut scenes with a story. There's the occasional touch of humor or personality (eg. the spawning money). Oh, and you can stomp on a downed enemy--but only once each time they're knocked over. But there are more ways, and larger ways, that it failed to grab me.

-The story mode is short. It has seven Acts, each a single leve. You have only one life per act, but the difficulty isn't so high that you're likely to die all that much. There is a survival mode where you can unlock other characters using coins that you earn. Since it would take hours of playing to unlock every character, that could extend the game for completionists.
-The move set and gameplay are very basic. You have jump, punch, kick, jump kick, stomp, and block.
-The player characters all feel pretty much the same, and the enemies all behave similarly. The bosses are only slightly bigger than the enemies and have the same moves. I was halfway through fighting the final boss before I looked at his name and realized that's what he was.
-The enemies have rather basic AI, limited to whether they move closer, hold their position, move backwards, or attack. No trying to go around you; they won't even move vertically unless you do. Combined with the limited moves of both protagonist and enemies, this makes for repetitive gameplay. You can beat each level by triggering a wave of enemies (the game has little variation in pacing), maneuvering so they're all on one side of you, and then just timing your attacks right. I didn't use the block button once.
-The story and dialogue are a nice addition but are just so-so.

This little beat-em-up has too many shortcomings for me to recommend it, even given the low price. It hearkens back to the arcade and console beat-em-ups of the 80s and 90s, only with gamelplay less enduring than even the mediocre ones. Urban Justice kept me somewhat entertained for a playthrough of the story mode, but it doesn't have great replay value. Sometimes in life, a person has had enough, whether it's criminals, drug dealers, annoying old people who yell about laws, or their insolent dogs that poop on your doorstep..  When you've had enough of the garbage you become a kick ass guy or gal, or guy that used to be a gal or gal that used to be a guy, or guy that is a girl but ..... (nevermind) walking around just randomly beating people up while you walk down the street .. Male, Female, Greaser, Fast Food Worker, Grandpa or Granma..  it really doesn't matter so long as you can punch them in the face.. 

I like to envision myself listening to Bittersweet Symphony or Staying Alive while I randomly punch strangers in the face or kick them in the groin.. it's all good baby boy.. 

The Story  

Criminals have taken over random city of  Urbania (or something else like that)  The three main characters are making like Owen Hart and saying enough is enough and it's time for a change.. 

Gameplay  

The game is obviously paying homage to classics like Final Fight and Streets of Rage,, even if it didn't say so in the store introduction it would be obvious to anyone who played those games.. If you played those games you understand completely how the gameplay of Urban Justice works..   It delivers nothing new to the genre, nor does it offer up anything unique or different..

The game's storymode is set up of 7 acts..  The game features 3 main characters, they each have 2 of their own acts, and the 7th act lets you choose between the three of them..   It also has a mode called Skirmish Mode which allows you to Endlessly wander down three different locations and fight random enemies and bosses..  (Bosses are just taller, slightly faster with more hp enemies)    Skirmish allows you the chance to earn Gold coins to unlock new characters to use ONLY in Skirmish mode.. 

Pro's 

Mindless button pressing fun
Easy to pick up and play
interesting story (albeit very short) 
Awesome price to content ratio

Con's

Really short story, as in you can finish the story in likely under an hour.. 
Wonky controls, sometimes your character will randomly stop walking or jump into the air
Glitches (sometimes enemies will just stand still)
2 Grindy achievements, see how I have 9 hours of gameplay,,  8 hours is grinding two achievements I still don't have.. just mindlessly wandering and killing boring horribly AI enemies 

Recommendations

It's hard to be too critical of Urban Justice.. the price tag of 1.99 is super affordable.  It delivers little over an hour of unique story content, and depending on how much you like or dislike Skirmish mode the content could be endless..  The game has a few glaring flaws.  If it had a bit more story content that would be great, but considering the price the content is OK..

While other better options exist, if you are on a budget or just looking for something to grab for less then a cup of coffee this game is perfect..    I'd recommend buying it as it'll make for a good couple of hours of fun when you're limited on time and it won't break the bank.. Buy the game and trust that it'll offer you a decent return on your investment.. La storia è la solita. Una città, in questo caso Riverden City è piena di criminali e i politici locali sono corrotti. Un giorno, Cris il nostro protagonista stava passeggiando per la città quando, nota una donna in pericolo e decide di aiutarla. Tempo dopo, anche Jill viene fermata da brutte persone ma contrariamente alla precedente donna, lei decide di rispondere per le rime. Nello stesso tempo da un'altra parte della città, Robert un anziano motociclista, nota un paio di delinquenti armeggiare vicino ad un'auto. E lui decide di fermarli. Questo trio tenterà di salvare la città dalla violenza che la ricopre. Questa è la storia. Il gioco invece è un beat em up tipo street of rage o simili, solo totalmente 3d. Ma, per una scelta stilistica, sia tutti i personaggi che gli sfondi sono creati per farli sembrare a bassi poligoni tipo lara croft del primo tomb raider. Solo un pò più definiti. E gli sfondi molto variegati ma adatti alla zona della città. Il gioco è piccolo e i 7 capitoli della storia si finiscono tranquillamente in mezz'ora o poco più. Non c'e rigiocabilità non essendoci livello di difficoltà nelle opzioni. Nelle stesse opzioni bisogna attivare l'opzione: Controller Affinity, di norma disattivata, altrimenti il primo giocatore non potrà giocare con il controller. Disattivando questa opzione il primo giocatore usa la tastiera e il secondo il controller. Invece, le meccaniche di gioco sono povere, i tre protagonisti usano le stesse mosse, l'unica differenza è la loro velocità di attacco e di danno, usando i soliti parametri. Il protagonista è medio, la donna veloce ma debole, l'anziano il contrario. La cosa che mi è piaciuta è una certa varietà non esagerata di nemici, quella che non mi è piaciuta è che quando un nemico sta a terra lo si può colpire solo 1 volta o con il pugno o con il calcio. Una volta colpito non è possibile colpirlo una seconda volta con l'altro attacco. Senza dimenticare che gli oggetti contundenti che si trovano nei livelli rompendo delle casse. Una volta presi non permettono di attaccare i nemici a terra, ma si consumano dando dei colpi sia a vuoto che a segno. C'e il tasto difesa ma non c'e nessun modo per fare le prese sui nemici. Il personaggio che controllate ha solo una vita, finita quella è game over. Fortunatamente ogni tanto, ci sono chioschi ambulanti di hot dog che, una volta distrutti, rilasciano un cibo random che vi ricarica tutta la barra di energia. Ah, durante il passaggio dei capitoli vi verranno donati dei crediti che vi serviranno a sbloccare nuovi personaggi che si potranno usare solo nella modalità schermaglia. Questa modalità non è altro che la modalità sopravvivenza, ossia si dovranno affrontare ondate infinite di nemici in uno dei tre ambienti in cui è composto il gioco. Ovviamente questa modalità la si può giocare in 2. Ogni nemico sconfitto in questa modalità vi da 1 credito, il boss 5 crediti. Invece come ho scritto prima, nella modalità principale, solo al termine di ogni atto vi danno crediti, da un minimo di 15 a un max di 30. E visto che l'ultimo personaggio per sbloccarlo ci vogliono + di 1000 crediti vi prolungherà la vostra permanenza in questo gioco. Ma solo se volete sbloccare tutti i personaggi. Altrimenti, vi durerà giusto mezz'ora. Un pò poco per il prezzo pieno ma a poco più di 1 euro e 50 può essere un'ottimo passatempo, ma in fin dei conti, solo scontato posso consigliarlo e solo se non avete altri giochi da iniziare. Altrimenti, lasciate pure perdere, ci sono beat em up senz'altro migliori senza parlare della prossima uscita di Street of Rage 4. ^_^

Aggiornamento: Visto che hanno inserito gli achievement con l'ultimo aggiornamento, il gioco vi durerà più di 10 ore di noia, per via dei ultimi 2 achievement che vogliono 5000 nemici e 500 boss sconfitti in modalità schermaglia. E fare avanti e indietro per un minimo di 30 volte nello stesso livello senza che nulla cambi, la noia regnerà sovrana. Perciò anche con questa aggiunta continuo a sconsigliare questo gioco. Incroyable tout simplement incroyable les imperfections qu'il y a dans ce jeu.
Etre bloqué en plein milieu de l'ecran dans les 6 premiers stages alors que le dernier on bloque à 
l'extremité de l'ecran comme n'importe quel beat them up.
Ce jeu est d'une lassitude hallucinante à tel point que je me suis endormi devant mon ecran.
Oser comparé ça à final fight et streets of rage lol il a meme pas 1% des qualités de ces deux jeux mythique. This had some potential

Nice graphics, fluid motion and an somewhat polished feeling to it.

How ever the game is let down by boring controls. Kick, Punch and block, thats it. Gets repetetive very quickly. 

My xbox clone controller wont work with it either.... so a thumbs down. 1. Controller behaves quite weird. Sometimes it's not detected at all, and while navigating menus you have to move your joystick repaetedly just to change the postion from default (which happens to be Exit %) ).
2. Didn't play long, but tactics seem to be very repetitive. Movement seems slowish, too. 
3. I don't mind graphics much, but they seem to be either a parody to something or really uninspired.
All in all, I'd recommend looking for something else Has a lot of potential but too many major bugs, especially when trying to use controllers. Also you can't even tell how much life your character has because the gauge always appears full when it shouldn't be."

三无属性的语音简直是我的xp暴击
蕾帕是全世界最可爱最有礼貌的宝宝 可爱的蕾帕，就像是cup，用完拔出来的时候会再给你一下 我个人很喜欢这个扩展包，两个角色的特点都非常鲜明，目前我两个角色都玩了 50 盘以上，胜率都在 38% 以上。

绿魔女比较无脑，在战斗中使用防御指令一次最多受 2 点伤害，自己 3hp 以上时可以防止自己在战斗中被一击毙命。另外绿魔女还具有 +1 攻，这样其他人即使想集火绿魔女也必须三思而后行。场地事件有恢复的话，绿魔女无限接近于无敌。

绿魔女的大招是一回合内无敌，理论上可以和最终决战形成 Combo，让人必死，但实际战斗中强烈不建议绿魔女把最终决战放入卡组，因为其他人摸到最终决战的概率是 3/4，你只有 1/4。其他人反而更有可能用最终决战强行摁死单次只受 2 点伤害的绿魔女。我一般是把大招当保险用，你残血且身后有战斗型选手时，你可以用一下，让那个战斗型选手因忌惮你的反击而失去跟你战斗的欲望。

蓝魔女的话逊色一点，但不弱。蓝魔女的被动诱惑力很强，但却不能乱用。你只能把它当成一个锦上添花的东西，而不能依赖这东西让自己变成战斗流。本身蓝魔女如果不乱用闪避的话，自身的抗性是和优空一样的，优空根本不弱，有些人还觉得优空很强；但如果你为了反弹伤害乱用闪避，那她甚至连凯和 QP 都不如。蓝魔女一般只要对 1 或 2 点攻击使用闪避就足够了，其他时候该防御就老老实实防御。

蓝魔女带卡应该优先挑选【增加防御】的卡，而不是【增加闪避】的卡。蓝魔女非常怕 boss，使用增加防御的卡可以增加蓝魔女遭遇 boss 后存活的可能性。另外在和玩家战斗时，蓝魔女本身 0 攻，对手增加防御效果有限，而且增加防御是挡不住蓝魔女“闪死人”这一招的。

对于虹色之环这东西，蓝魔女一定要确保使用后闪避点数 ≥ 自身 HP + 防御点数的情况下再使用。通俗点讲就是满血时不用，掉血了就可以用。比如说，当你 4hp 时，你受到 5 点攻击，不用虹环时，选防御扔出 2~6 点能存活；用了虹环以后，不论选防御还是闪避，都只有扔出 3~6 点才能存活，也就是满血时用虹环，抗性反而下降。攻击点数更高时也一样，用虹环就是比不用更难存活。而如果 3hp 时，再使用可以保证情况不会比不使用更糟糕，读者可以自行去计算一下。

蓝魔女的大招是让人定身一回合，显而易见的用法是 200 星五级时定自己直接拿下胜利，因此蓝魔女在大地图里前期可以多注重走位踩好格子，而不需要急急地进家升级。还有一种用法是定住领先的但踩到了蓝格或 boss 格的对手，把领先的对手拉下水（本招对有神鬼的 poppo，以及任何有派对／这里那里的人无效）。当其他人没有对你产生威胁的时候，别乱用大招拉仇恨。 A suitable pack for everyone who loves seeing other players suffer. Oh, you spent all your stars for a silly little chase over the whole map? Fuck you, I only take 2 damage. And don't get me started on Cleopatra – similar to Iru, but there's still a glimpse of hope that you will survive the fight. Unless she rolls an evade. She always rolls an evade. 
 You get a silly low-energy campaign teasing a vaporware game and a bunch of tepid characters therefrom. Both have unique strengths and can be extraordinarily abusive in the right situations, but neither are really important to have. Get it for completion's sake, and for Repa's wacky voice. WARNING: The devs have hidden negative reviews, warned/banned people falsely, the forum can be toxic, bullying and fanboyism is rampant, their mods are awful, plenty of greed, game balance/quality is on the decline, and more.

[b]General[/b]:

Officially this gets a negative rating due to the developers' actions. Unofficially, my opinion is that the DLC is alright, even if Ceo is a bit on the weak side and neglected. Overall it's a reasonably balanced DLC, nothing too extreme.

Ceo is your typical evasive unit with a twist, specializing in penalizing enemies who she succesfully avoids attacks of, and Miu is a unusual anti-bully unit with strong (counter-)attacks but limited durability.

---

[b]Ceo (or Ceoreparque)[/b] (4HP, 0 ATK / 0 DEF / +1 EVD, 5 REC):
(Passive: When succesfully evading attacks, deal 1 DMG to the opponent. This counts as battle damage.)

Ceo is a evasion-based unit who specializes in taking down -1 ATK units and Tanks by inflicting damage twice in battle, by succesfully evading the enemy's attacks.

In addition, her hyper is a versatile tool that lets her choose and lock down a single opponent, rendering them unable to move on their upcoming turn and forcing them to re-activate the tile they are on. She can also use it on herself for double bonuses or level-ups on Home Tiles.

[b]Pros[/b]:
-Anti-Tank & Anti -1 ATK.
-Saboteur & Manipulator (Hyper lets her sabotage enemies or help herself).

[b]Cons[/b]:
-Fragile (low HP and evasion-based, and has trouble holding onto her stars).
-Very luck-based (since evasion is all about luck).

[b]Feedback[/b]:
Ceo is a unit that is interesting on paper, but needs work in reality. She can only really exploit units with low ATK, and her evasion-based gameplay makes her fragile and makes her unable to hold her Stars for long, which is not good when she is lackluster at stealing stars.

Her lack of durability also means her gimmick is hard to pull off and generally not worth it, often getting her (almost) killed. I'd consider her one of the weakest units in the game at the time of writing, honestly.

[b]Suggestions[/b]:
-Give her base Max HP of 5.

---

[b]Miu (or Miusaki)[/b] (4HP, +1 ATK / -2* DEF / 0 EVD, 5 REC):
(Passive: When defending, never take more then 2 DMG.)

Miu is a powerful but fragile anti-bully, able to survive immense damage and delivering powerful (counter-)attacks to her foes. In addition her hyper makes her invulnerable to damage until her next turn.

[b]Pros[/b]:
-Anti-Bully (powerful (counter-)attack, and can survive any DMG).
-Can catch up through combat.

[b]Cons[/b]:
-Weak to Tanks & resillient units.

[b]Feedback[/b]: For some reason Miu had +1 EVD and they decided to nerf her, which seemed highly unneccesary. Well, she still works but it feels like +1 EVD was better, especially since she is a ""two-hit"" unit who must be hit twice to KO (if at 3-4 HP).

[b]Suggestions[/b]:
-Make her hyper ignore damage taken from ""Set HP to 1"" effects and Instant KO effects.
And...
-Maybe reinstate her base +1 EVD.
Or...
-Maybe give her +1 EVD when her HP is at 2 or lower.

A solid DLC.

*or trolling good >w< Both the characters are pretty fun, actually. They're really great in battles, but from what I've played so far I'd say Miusaki is the heaviest hitter. Repa has some nice tactical options. Repa é a personagem com a melhor voz do jogo. 10% da velocidade normal das outras. Tem vezes que uma linha de fala dura 3~5 turnos(online) This DLC is very nice, unique offer for players who enjoy 100% Orange Juice and want some for variety for the game. The price is excellent for what you get. These are characters I personally tend to use, both are iconic in their own right. Two additional great characters, and an extra story as well. You get an additional home marker and board by beating their story on extreme mode. Miusaki is great cause you never take more than 2 damage when defending, shes good in battles. I love Ceoreparque and Miusaki's designs as well. I don't think I have ever played as Ceoreparque despite getting this DLC on it's release, but she's cute. 

I didin't go into as much detail as I feel you can figure that stuff out yourself, all you need to know is this DLC is well worth it if you want some cool new characters and more story mode."

Сценарий на 3-4 смены, где, вот тебе на, за три дня эпидемия началась, побуянила, да и закончилась. Я не встретил ничего нового, кроме пары новых вызовов, по одному костюму хим-защиты для каждого типа службы. Даже ни одного звонка не было от какого нибудь больного или умирающей бабушки, чтобы хоть было волнение за население. ХОТЯ В ПОСЛЕДНЕМ ДОЛГЕ МНЕ В УШИ ОРАЛИ И ПЛАКАЛИ ВСЕ, ПОТОМУ-ЧТО ИМ НУЖНА БЫЛА ПОМОЩЬ. Мне за весь сценарий только один раз сообщили о переполненных больницах (причём не всех, а оставшиеся даже не начали думать о переполнении. Видимо, пациентов там просто отправляли в китайскую провинцию Пы из Ду на лечение.) и о том, что из соседнего района в мою больницу должны скинуть 3 заболевших и уехать. Ну, скорая приехала, скинула в моей больнице три полутрупа иииии... осталась до конца смены работать на меня. Круто!

Стоит брать только по скидке ради какого-то достижения, не больше! Лично в моём случае - спасибо другу. 疫情时期体验这个DLC是种很奇妙的事情 If you spent 2020-2023 thinking, ""man I would love to be the jackboots that enforce this tyranny in the name of fighting a cold"", then this is the DLC for you.

Want to send the cops after some guy who decided to go for a jog, instead of staying inside his house? You can do that.

Want to send the cops to shut down a struggling restaurant trying not to go out of business by staying open during restrictions? You can do that.

Want to send the cops to break up a gathering of friends and family, because State Daddy says they can't do that? You can do that.

Want to lose a big chunk of your units because they tested positive on a dodgy C19 test and had to be quarantined? That's going to happen. A lot. 

Want to send the cops to force people into taking an experimental ""vaccine"" with the most side effects of any ""vaccine"" in history?  Well too bad, you can't actually do that in this DLC, but maybe this just released before vaccine mandates became a thing. 

Ok with that out of the way...

It's actually a pretty good idea for a DLC.  I think the problem is that they specifically used C19 (or at least a coronavirus) for the pandemic.  It fits in perfectly with all of the fearmongering going on in 2020 over c19, but they don't go overboard with the hysteria or body counts.  You'll have to pick up a couple of bodies of people who died from the virus, but I tend to just imagine they were old and frail people, who likely would have died the next time they caught a common cold anyway. 

With the hindsight of living in 2024, and seeing first hand the contrast between the  insane levels of fearmongering, totalitarian policies, etc, and the actual minor severity of the virus itself, it's impossible to recommend this DLC.

I would have preferred they had gone for a more Hollywood-esque pandemic.  Some fictional virus, higher body counts etc, you know something that would actually justify mass quarantines, restrictions, use of heavy duty protective gear etc. 

Between the cringe of reliving the joke that was the ""pandemic"", and the annoyance of having so many units get removed for quarantine, it's not worth it. [h1] Пандемия уже здесь! [/h1]

Данное дополнение наглядно демонстрирует нам жизнь города в условиях пандемии.

Проведение карантинных мер, оказание помощи заболевшим, переполненные больницы. Всё это ожидает нас в данном дополнении. И справиться со всем этим действительно не так уж и просто. Не стоит забывать, что наши отряды так же подвержены воздействию вируса.

На борьбу с невидимым противником на помощь придут новые виды снаряжения, с помощью которых мы смоем защитить наши отряды. Однако будет ли этого достаточно, чтобы раз и навсегда покончить с пандемией? Зависит только от вас. Сказать мало что можно про дополнение. Оно годное, но короткое - 5-6 смен.

首先，这个DLC的优点是真实，缺点是过于真实——玩战役模式和自由模式中，如果开启这个DLC，那么疫情爆发后你就要给一大堆单位换装，而且简单的口罩一点作用都没有（不要和慈善DLC里面的口罩弄混了，慈善DLC的口罩只是装饰），防御力太差了，一定要换防护服，而且警察和消防的防护服不如医生使用的防护服，经常出现尽管全员几乎都是防护服结果单位少了一大半情况——都被隔离了。关键是防护服也很贵，这也意味着你要考虑经费问题，自由模式如果是后期开局，那么游戏提供的现金可以说足够你全员换装，而自由模式前期开局和战役模式需要考虑在疫情爆发前你有没有足够的资金，如果没有，那就等着看你单位覆灭吧！（当然，现实情况里面这些单位人员更忙，像医务人员等抗疫一线人员致敬）制作组甚至贴心的还原了第二波疫情，不知该笑还是不该笑。
然后关于情景，情景倒是比较还原，不过也有些槽点——还原的地方，包括火神、雷神山医院（不过制作组只做了火神山，但看得出来制作组也有关注火神山建造直播，毕竟宣传片也有这个片段），过载的医院，村口老大爷示威（中国国外这种类型就更多了，规模也更大），缺点就两条：一是难度还是比较大，首先里面提到的问题依然暴露在这情景里面，经常没钱换装，不懂技巧给一个单位一件防护服的在这情景很容易因为没钱招人和单位太少而寄，另外槽点就是武汉是被全国支援的，从没听过武汉还要派人支援其他地区，毕竟武汉再支援那是真的没医护了。情景虽然只有一个，但对于中国玩家来说，觉得很不错了。以及这个情景难度还算简单，比龙卷风猎人这个不提前部署无法通过第一天、基辅暴动不叫人就别想玩、音乐节如何利用好自行车以及澳洲大火如何手控消防灭火要简单多了……流程太长我真的会屑，五天流程可以了，最后一战十几天我头有点疼……
装备的话也是一个槽点，适用面太小了，除了疫情就没什么作用了——除了最后一战Cosplay可以用（不过估计没人会有闲工夫在自由模式玩这个，最后一战情景也没有这些装备可选）然后就这点，但是很致命，它成了占地方用了……没了……（不过自由模式最后一战没钱了可以卖掉这些回本，这也算是优点了）
以上就是对这个DLC的评价，缺点大于优点的DLC。 Let's face it: The actual COVID pandemic was way worse than what this game portrayed.

Those who complain its too hard should be shoved into the ops room IRL then:
People dying all over the place, EMS staff dropping like flies, only rich countries having the finances for extra supplies.
IRL masks did very little to prevent infection when you are sprayed with infected body fluids.

This game did well to simulate COVID & then turned down the difficulty so it wasnt impossible to beat.
I barely made it past the 3 duties with half my team under quarantine when it was declared over.

Kudos to the devs for understanding & making this.

Would love to see the devs tackle the other pandemics like SARS, Ebola, etc... and possibly regional outbreaks like dengue, malaria, etc. Literal dog water of a DLC. Developers attempt to make it difficult was substituted by making the game painstakingly annoying. It's just stupid to lose literally 11 full staffed patrol cars to quarantine. Then going down to the bare minimum for medical transports, because again quarantining. I equipped everyone with masks, just like real life, it does little to nothing to prevent quarantining. Crazy realism there. But come on! Even when I gave my life flight crew a step down from a hazmat suit, they still quarantined one shift in. That's ridiculous! The ""subsidy"" I got for the pandemic was dogshit. It was $100,000, when I'm running the whole city of Berlin, literally all the districts and I get half I make as BASE income from the districts I supervise. Like, that is pocket change, not an emergency fund. Let's put into perspective, $100,000, is literally ONE predetermined fire truck. JUST ONE. That's just absurd. It's a horrible DLC when you have half of your staff go into quarantine at the same time. Don't get the DLC unless you like being buttfucked. Like it's just stupid, I put so much time forming this team that spans like 70 units, all named and everything. I quickly am down to like 54 units that are struggling, mainly my paramedics and police. I do use the backup feature, but the amount of money I would have to drop now is absurd, and the pandemic is over, yet everyone still gets quarantined. I would have to drop, $5000 x 11, just to bring police back to speed. $55000, just to have enough police cars and officers to be sufficient for the shift. But let's not forget the huge increase in call volumes for this dlc, it's unreal and just stressful. Of course the job is stressful, but I would unpause for a second, a SECOND, and get 3 new incidents.

[h1] All in All, Ass DLC [/h1]
 Like, I was curious about this DLC, well its a bit shit, nothing special in game mechanics and not even one call with deseased patient (dabing call missing) or something, just buy protective equipment, send units and have half of department in quarantine. Thats all. It could be something special but I guess not. Atleast I got it on sale. 딱히 재미있는건 아니지만 그냥 저냥 할만한 시나리오 如很多评论所说，内容太少，流程太短，缺少对疫情爆发这段历史的深度刻画，算不上一个合格的DLC。
Short duration, less content, lack of detailed description & new features related to Pandemic Outbreak. Agreed with others' comments: this is not a DLC, but only a SCENARIO at most. скорее минус, чем плюс:
- кампания короткая и не слишком напряженная, даже на ""харде"";
- актуальность проблемы короновируса нынче не самая высокая;
+ есть возможность надеть на экипажи халаты и маски, да)

Thanks devs for setting up OCE servers for us on such short notice <3 Had tons of fun. Hands down has potential to be better than Echo VR. Already worked up a sweat seeing how many times I could dunk on the robot, so it makes me hope that more people will discover this game so the matches will be more competitive. Overall great game!!! The game sets a new direction for VR - arcade. This is the best game in this genre for VR devices and its quality meets all requirements. I really hope that the developers will not abandon the game at this stage, because its potential is huge. I hope that in the future there will be a rating system, and perhaps become the first cyber sports game for VR
Another main feature - the developers regularly answer questions in discord and even hold events for players, together with the development team. I wrote a couple of bugs, which were quickly answered and fixed in the next patch, and updates here are regular. Enjoy my friends Multiplayer doesn't work!!! Please fix it!
We tried to create a room with a friend and play, and we were thrown out when creating.
If you fix it, then I will recommend the game. In the meantime, don't even play. Space Ball VR is an Early Access free to play  VR sports game with gorillia movement.  It worked on my Index system, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  Has soccer and basketball gamemodes. Has Bots that are good.

Maybe try this free game, you might like it. My most favourite game in VR so far. Great cardio, nice mechanics, Soccer and Basketball modes <3. Rocket League + Gorilla Tag vibes. Music and sounds are great too. And its FREE =) Space Ball VR is a phenomenal virtual reality game that completely immerses players. With the use of virtual reality controllers, players must skillfully hit a ball into a goal. The game is highly customizable with various arenas and difficulty levels to choose from. However, the graphics could be better, and the game may be too challenging for casual players. Despite these minor flaws, Space Ball VR is an incredibly fun and engaging game that is perfect for sci-fi and sports enthusiasts alike. Great game. Rocket league but in VR. As if you'd play from 1st pov in RL while trying to hit the ball. Its fun and crazy but I got tired after an hour of play. It 100% can and willl substitute a workout lol.

Play it. Especially if you've ever played rl. You'll enjoy it 🙂 ONCE AGAIN CAW CAW, CROW IS THE FIRST PERSON TO REVIEW A VR GAME ON STEAM CAW CAW. AND WHAT A WORTHLESS REVIEW IT IS CAW CAW.

One of the buffs has the spanish message of ""Text not found"" on it... I assume it causes bleeding, but overall the demo comes across as more of a beta test to see if we can spot areas of concern

cute concept overall though, I hope to play it more come full release! Tem dinossauros no jogo 👍 Minha esposa me deixou depois de jogar esse jogo por algumas horas. Recomendo, depois de um tempo jogando vc se torna o especialista de builds Dinossauros + rogue like, combinação que ninguém esperava mas que foi feita de um jeito divertido, gostei dessa combinação. No geral é um jogo divertido, com um certo desafio, ao meu ver a dificuldade está de um jeito em que você precisa pensar em alguma estratégia legal pra passar dos inimigos, não dá pra passar de primeira sem ter um certo conhecimento. É um jogo que tem um potencial legal se tiver uma variedade legal de coisas pra fazer, e uma dessas coisas é o rank que vai ajudar bastante a engajar o jogador. O pterodáctilo é roubado. [h1]Dino Tower Arena[/h1]
Achei o jogo na busca incessante de jogos na steam, e o jogo me cativou de inicio ao ver que o jogo é estilizado em uma pixel-art extremamente bem feita, jogo tem menus bonitos controles responsivos e mecanicas Power-ups e inimigos bem feitos, ele é um Vampire-survivors MAS com dinossauros e seus proprios twists e ideias em um mapa menor e mais focado em outros aspectos como power ups. 
[h3]Bom ou não?[/h3]
Achei um ótimo jogo pra quem quer um joguinho legal e bem feito pra passar o tempo eu joguei a demo e com certeza acho que o jogo full vai ser muito bom, podem dar uma chance que vai ser sem erro uma boa jogatina. Achei super divertido. Usar a temática de dinossauros é algo que sentimos falta hoje em dia e isso deu um plus a mais ao visual. 

Sobre o gameplay é tudo muito frenético e muito divertido com ótimas combinações de habilidades. Fiquei com um gostinho de quero mais e por isso ficarei de olho nos updates seguintes. 

Ótima demo! Overall, a pretty fun game with cute art! A nice variety of powerups, even though it's just a demo. The leaderboard adds a nice objective to pursue roguelike e dinossauros, n tem como dar errado Joguinho divertido, viciante, com música boa e arte maneiríssima!

Não sou ninguém sem os espinhos de gelo help Do you like Dinos? Yes?
Do you like Towers? Oh yes too?
Do you like Arenas? Oh god you will not believe it...

I have the perfect recomendation for you! 

But seriously, this game is very fun. I like the combat and roguelike elements, and trying out different builds. The ability to reroll the powerup store is very welcomed and makes you feel like the build you chose is the build you wanted. The combat is fast paced and feels good.
 nice demo, cute dinossaurs and fun to play O jogo tem uma proposta muito interessante com seus sistemas de waves e tem vários acertos, como a recuperação de vida entre waves, dito que o é muito fácil tomar dano e os números estão bem expressivos.
Infelizmente o jogo tem muitos problemas que deixam ele extremamente repetitivo e enjoativo. A maioria deles provenientes de um game design que deixa um pouco a desejar, como a velocidade e freneticidade ser mais uma coisa que atrapalha do que uma característica própria do jogo. Chega um ponto que você nem sequer vê os inimigos ou a si próprio e só atira pra todo lado rezando pra n tomar dano. 
Os upgrades são pouquíssimo variados e extremamente genéricos, o que torna o interesse por upar seu personagem, meramente obrigatório e não de curiosidade.
O Pterodáctilo é só quebrado. 
Fiz um combo de skills no final que só quebrou o jogo por completo e tornava impossível eu demorar mais de 3 segundos por wave e impossível de tomar dano.
No geral, a proposta é bem interessante e achei o jogo bacana, mas precisa de um ótimo polimento em vários aspectos. Very fun arena battle game with a lot of builds to test on. The dinos are very cool and their interesting, when they swarm on you it's very challenging to survive and beat them all, but it's very rewarding when you do it. Can't wait to see the complete game. Simplesmente um verdadeiro confronto entre dinossauros, além disso, o game possui diversos upgrades e um nível de dificuldade que o torna desafiador sem que deixe de ser divertido. Such a fun game!!! Tem dinossauros, isso deveria ser o suficiente!

MAS

O jogo tem uma gameplay viciante, upgrades variados e músicas legais.

Plus: Você pode ter uma cartola no seu dinossauro. I really liked the game, even though it was still in demo mode, the game has a lot of upgrades that change the way you play. I just wish there was more clarity in some parts of the game. For example, the poison skill says that the attack inflicts poison that causes 50 damage, but it doesn't specify whether it's the default attack or if it applies to all attacks we take. Another thing I would like is a debuff indicator on enemies. For example, in Hades, when an enemy is under the effect of a debuff, an icon appears on the enemy's head. The same could be done here in the dinotower arena. ............... __

This tycoon themed game is perfect for those who enjoy cute creatures, casual paced game-play, catching and selling and earning as many coins as possible. Completing bonus tasks inside the game is also a great way to fill your personal aquarium with fish if you don't like spending the in game currency. 
I do find however that the bonus tasks are very buggy and won't let you claim completed tasks. I have 4-5 tasks sitting there and I'm unable to claim the rewards from them. On top of that, once you've unlocked/obtained everything, the game becomes quite lacking. There's no new quests, no unlockables, no storyline, it just becomes super repetitive at that point. 

Overall I would rate this game: 3.5/5 Aquarium Land is pretty much just a phone game redone on computer, but fixed so that there is no wait for 'in-app purchase' type of content. I enjoyed playing this while watching or listening to other stuff. The gameplay is simple but rewarding, and I found the sealife to be quite cute. A good buy if looking for something simple and satisfying to play. 

Now to the real reason we're here... the achievements. Now I found an exploit to get the badges needed to win the Beauty Cup by buying a bunch of new decor and just spam clicking on it. It's a bit difficult but worth the effort rather than buying the fish for the tank and such to get the badges normally. Overall the achievements were easy to complete (is mainly just completing everything in the game). 

One big issue about the game, the DLC did not work for me. I don't know if I needed to own all DLC, but I got the parrot pet DLC and couldn't use it. Very sad as I wanted a little parrot companion, but hopefully might get fixed in the future :) https://youtu.be/z1wre9t-eJc

Basically a busy work grind fest with an aquatic theme, the astronomically long timers only further this vibe. It’s just a bunch of random things thrown at you. It feels like a mobile game thrown together with timers and random junk and two currencies and beauty cups and who knows what else. It throws it all at you in a matter of minutes. There is more content but it’s just piling this stuff on in a haphazard way. Maybe if you want a strange mobile game you would enjoy this?

I don’t think most of these reviews are real, and I do not recommend this. アプリ広告でプレイしたことあるようなゲーム。

魚を集めて売りお金を稼ぐ、レアな魚は（主に大型）は大型水槽に入れ見に来た人がお金を置いていく。
お金で新しい魚やステージをアンロックする。
魚の捕まえ方は視界に入れて一定時間キープする、一部レアな魚はそこそこ難しい。

自分は外部バンドルで入手したが、steamでもセール時に174円になるので広告なしで広告っぽいゲームがやりたければ買い。 The game is okay but very repetitive and grindy. More grindy than does it good.

You essentially walk around, catch fish, sell them and use the money to unlock more catchable fish. Every now and then you are given a key to catch a fancy special fish in a cave. There are 9 locations to complete, all with the same things to do but more expensive unlocks.

Sometimes the game felt kinda buggy, too. fishing/aquarium manager tycoon type game. buy more tanks, catch fish, upgrade your speed/capacity, repeat. not mind blowing, but fun. recommended on sale. this is a port of one of those generic phone games. ( i admit it has appeal), but loose its shine even quicker when you arent waiting on ads. Aquarium Land is the eight game that i played of the QubicGames bundle 20 games for 20$ that happen during every big sale(so far)

The overview of this bundle is if you like repetitive grindy game go for it, if not, don't buy

Aquarium land follow the same formula as dig deep or astro miner where you collect something, buy upgrade collect more thing, etc. The scaling is fine but waiting around for customer to come and buy fish to make your money really sucked. plus the fact that there was no automatic system to make the shopper pay.

I might have given it a mixed positive review if this was my first game of the bundle but it being the eight, i've already seen the formula multiple time and it is getting a bit old. 神作，好游戏，两小时后有惊喜，爆炸推荐! (ENGLISH + SPANISH)

Aquarium Land: A Stardew Valley, but with aquariums.

Ok, maybe what I just said in the title is a bit of an exaggeration, but you can’t deny that playing this game—with how relaxing it is and the way you can improve and customize your aquarium—gives you the same vibe as when you play Stardew Valley. That feeling of tranquility, of constant progress, of seeing your efforts materialize into something beautiful… it’s hard not to draw the comparison!

Honestly, I really liked the game. It’s quite good, and for a mobile port to PC, they did a solid job with widescreen support, achievements, and the additional content they added. The progression is super smooth and fluid; you get hooked without even realizing it, and the way you have to manage and organize your different aquariums is an entertaining challenge that never feels tedious. Plus, the fish are absolutely adorable, even though the graphics are quite minimalistic. They manage to give it that cute touch that makes you want to keep expanding and improving your aquarium.

Now, the only thing that threw me off a bit was the music. I understand they tried to make it relaxing, but it gets very repetitive after a while. I think they could have varied it a bit more, maybe adding different tracks for the various areas or phases of the game, because after a few hours, it gets stuck in your head and isn’t relaxing anymore—it starts to get a bit annoying. But beyond that, I really enjoyed the game. I liked it so much that I ended up getting all the achievements and completing it 100%.

A piece of advice I have for you, and this is important: be careful with the first aquarium, because there’s a small bug that really messed up my game. There’s a moment when you have to catch a legendary fish in a cave. If you fail, there’s a small chance—like what happened to me—that the game will kick you out of the cave and you won’t be able to re-enter. It’s a weird bug that I found out about after checking some forums, and it forced me to go into my computer’s AppData files, delete the save, and start a new game just to catch that fish and continue progressing.

Other than that, I didn’t find any other bugs that bothered me, and overall, the experience was very positive. In summary, Aquarium Land is a relaxing, well-made game, and if you like titles that let you disconnect and spend several hours in a state of calm, it’s an excellent choice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Aquarium Land: Un Stardew Valley, pero de acuarios.

Ok, puede que lo que acabo de decir en el título sea un poco exagerado, pero no me van a negar que jugar a este juego, con lo relajante que es y la forma en la que podés mejorar y personalizar tu acuario, no te da la misma vibra que cuando jugás al Stardew Valley. Esa sensación de tranquilidad, de progreso constante, de ver cómo tus esfuerzos se materializan en algo hermoso… ¡es difícil no comparar!

La verdad, el juego me gustó mucho. Es bastante bueno y, para ser un port de celular a PC, hicieron un laburo piola con el soporte widescreen, los logros, y el contenido adicional que le sumaron. La progresión es súper cómoda y fluida; te vas enganchando sin darte cuenta, y la manera en la que tenés que ir organizando y gestionando tus distintos acuarios es un desafío entretenido que nunca se siente pesado. Además, los peces son una ternura total, a pesar de que los gráficos son bastante minimalistas. Logran darle ese toque adorable que te dan ganas de seguir expandiendo y mejorando tu acuario.

Ahora, lo único que me descolocó un poco fue la música. Entiendo que intentaron hacerla relajante, pero se vuelve muy repetitiva después de un rato. Creo que ahí podrían haber variado un poco más, tal vez agregando distintos temas para las diferentes áreas o fases del juego, porque después de unas horas se te mete en la cabeza y ya no te relaja, sino que te empieza a cansar un poco. Pero, más allá de eso, disfruté mucho el juego. Tanto que terminé sacándole todos los logros y platinándolo.

Un consejo que les doy, y que es importante: tengan cuidado con el primer acuario, porque hay un pequeño bug que me jodió bastante la partida. Hay un momento en el que tenés que conseguir un pez legendario en una cueva. Si fallás, hay una mínima probabilidad de que, como me pasó a mí, el juego te saque de la cueva y después no puedas volver a entrar. Es un bug medio raro que encontré investigando en foros y que me obligó a meterme en los archivos de AppData de mi computadora, borrar la partida y empezar de nuevo para poder agarrar ese pez que me faltaba y seguir progresando.

Fuera de eso, no encontré ningún otro bug que me molestara, y la experiencia en general fue muy positiva. En resumen, Aquarium Land es un juego relajante, bien hecho, y que si te gustan los títulos que te permiten desconectar y pasar varias horas en un estado de calma, es una excelente opción. This game is so relaxing and calm! The animals that help you with things are so cute and helpful! I would suggest people who are always stressed out to try this game! 《水族馆乐园》—和海洋动物做好朋友！

《水族馆乐园》一款模拟经营类游戏。游戏是从手游改编过来，目前steam的版本还没有中文。游戏中玩家将扮演你做水族馆的老板，一边亲力亲为的下海捕鱼，一边还要升级自己的各种能力，招募员工来帮助自己解放双手。游戏的主要玩法就是抓鱼，依靠卖鱼来赚钱，依靠钱来解锁更多可以抓的鱼，然后再循环往复。不过游戏中有很多的地图，每张地图中都是全新的鱼类，而且还有一些地图的收集品可以进行收集，游戏趣味性还是相当充足的。

[h1]简单说说[/h1]
游戏中玩家最开始只能进行简单的人力捞鱼，然后随着等级的提升还可以去开快艇捞鱼，后期如果获得了足够多的钻石，还可以依靠钻石进行雇人捞鱼等等。总之是在解放双手的路上越走越远了，游戏采用的是买断制，在玩法上也不像手游似的会出现很多的广告。基本上玩家稳扎稳打就能很快的通关前几张地图，而且由于游戏的货币是继承制的，完全可以在前一关赚到足够多的钱再去下一关，整体难度还是不算高的。

游戏中还拥有很多很多的皮肤，这些皮肤都会随着玩家角色等级的提升而自动获取。除此之外，玩家在下海捞鱼的过程中还会发现一些可以换取钻石的珍珠，探索每张地图独有的收集物品（宝藏）。然后随着获取的金钱越来越多，去提升自己的基础属性，同时可以花钱去购买水族馆内VIP的升级，或者雇佣更多的员工来给自己捞鱼。游戏中的升级大多数都可以在金币和钻石中二选一，还是比较友好的。

[h1]总结[/h1]
总的来讲是一款相当休闲的小游戏，操作并不算费力，个人感觉移植的也算是很成功了，如果能把中文补上，那么就相当值得推荐了。

[/url]简洁的语言，实用的内容 [/quote] 无中文，不影响游戏，模拟经营游戏，开一家水族馆，需要玩家自己下海抓鱼，然后卖给顾客。抓鱼很简单，只要鱼儿在范围内一定时间即可自动抓取，鱼的种类很多，有稀有品种。可以花费金钱提升背包和移动速度，并且满足一定条件后可以经营多家族馆，十分有趣。 [h2] 《水族馆乐园》[/h2]
20款游戏中内唯一一款意义上的模拟经营类游戏，自己需要下海捕捞鱼类，然后放入大厅展示，不过这里我就要说说了，说好的水族馆乐园，来了还把展览鱼给买走是吧哈哈哈，本作细节方面可以说有点注重，还给配有跳水动作，较为简单的美女建模，粗中带有一丝丝美感，还是挺带劲的。 [h1]轻松愉快的模拟经营游戏：水族馆乐园[/h1]
本作是一款由Qubic Games发行的轻松愉快的模拟经营游戏。玩家需要从购买鱼缸、捕捉各种鱼类、售卖给顾客开始，通过反复经营，最终成为商业巨擘。

[h2]游戏玩法与特色[/h2]
游戏包含了许多内容。游戏初期，玩家需要亲自管理每一个细节，从金鱼的捕捉、购买观赏鱼缸到吸引顾客售卖金鱼。然而，当玩家进入中期后，店铺规模变大，一个人难以应付怎么办？不要担心，本作支持双人联机，可以叫上朋友一起畅快捕鱼！如果店铺依然忙不过来，我们还可以选择雇佣AI员工，实现真正的“做大做强”的梦想。
游戏中还有稀有金鱼。当捕捉到珍稀鱼类后，可以将其放入私人鱼缸中，从摆设鱼缸的海草到亲自喂养小鱼，也能体验别样的乐趣。同时，游戏中钻石的获取极为重要，通常可以通过完成场景任务和正常任务获得。小建议：钻石最好用来招募员工，这样后期只需要挂机收钱就可以了。

[h2]完美的经营游戏[/h2]
总的来说，这款游戏是一款非常杀时间的游戏。尽管不支持中文，但由于游戏本身没有过多的文字，即使看不懂基本上也可以畅快玩耍，非常推荐喜欢模拟经营的玩家尝试。

[/url]简洁的语言，实用的内容 [/quote]
 玩家需要经营水族馆，并且还需要下海捕鱼，玩家需要不断升级来捕更好的鱼拿去卖钱，并且还可以探索洞穴，拼凑船只等。目前游戏不支持中文，不过理解难度较低，不太影响游玩。支持多人游玩，和兄弟一起捕鱼寻宝更加有趣。 一款操作非常简单的模拟经营游戏，融入了捕鱼、建设、经营等常见元素，轻松且休闲。

[h1]玩法[/h1]
没有任何教程，开启游戏后直接进入正式流程。
本作中的大部分交互都只需要角色站在对应点位或是保持移动即可，因此操作非常便捷。

首先领用系统给的初始资金来建设一个放置鱼的容器，就可以开始去抓鱼了。
进入场景右侧的水中游泳，靠近可以捕捉的鱼后，角色前方会出现一个扇形区域，保持移动使扇形区域覆盖鱼一段时间便可成功捕捉。
随后将鱼带到容器旁就会自动放入。

接下来会不断有顾客来参观，顾客还会挑选心仪的鱼来购买，玩家需要操控角色到门口为顾客结账，流程也很简单，主要走过去，票子就会不断收入口袋。
由于每种容器只能容纳一种海洋生物，接下来需要用获得的金钱建设新的容器，也可以在npc处购买背包升级、速度升级等。

游戏还提供了水上摩托、游艇等多种捕鱼手段，此外还可以雇佣工人来帮助作业。

[h1]画面[/h1]
游戏是3D固定视角的，采用了低多边形建模，整体色彩明亮，配合舒爽的音乐，很有放松的感觉。
游戏还设计了多种角色外观可供解锁， 如海盗、海王、鲨鱼人、美女、精灵、圣诞老人等。

[h1]中文[/h1]
本作不支持简体中文，但整体内容比较简单，加上用的都是一些入门级别的英语，游玩起来也没有那么大的障碍。

[h1]总评[/h1]
轻松愉悦的模拟经营游戏，玩法很简单，上手就会，玩腻了同类型作品，试试这个究极简化版也不错。

[h1]建议[/h1]
建议入手20周年组合包，20个游戏一共88元，单个合4元多一点，非常划算。

The dark humor is spot on, keeping you laughing as you blast your way through hordes of enemies while riding the coattails of your grandfather’s insane adventures. From the moment you grab your gun, you’re in for a relentless barrage of fun. Steampunk gadgets? Check. Cowboys? Check. Ridiculous moments that will have you laughing out loud?

Plus, who doesn’t want to channel their inner bounty hunter and just go full-on gunslinger mode in virtual reality? 🎯

If you’re after a fun, action-packed VR experience that doesn’t take itself too seriously but still delivers on the thrills, Guns'n'Stories: Preface VR is the perfect choice. Get ready for a whole lot of laughter, action, and steampunk gun-slinging glory!

Created with <3 Para ser un juego gratuito, no esta nada mal. Es de lo mejor que me he encontrado para realidad virtual hablando de F2P. Es cortito, pero bastante entretenido. Tampoco se le puede exigir mucho siendo un titulo que te descargas y juegas sin pagar un solo céntimo. Super recomendada su descarga, te aseguro que te divertirás jugandolo, aunque solo sea por un rato. Хорошая озвучка, приятная графика, но... Через минуту после старта вылетает. Шлем квест 3 И это ты называешь угрозой? Вылетает через минуту или две после старта. Шлем Пико 4 Very, VERY good for an arcade game.

Pros: Excellent gun and enemy variety, good humor and immersion in the grandad's story. Nice graphics. Fun story-telling (even if it isn't much). FREE.

Cons: Gameplay feels repetitive and a bit simplistic... but that's why it's excellent [i]for an arcade game.[/i]

890290,DCS: L-39 Albatros - Kursant Campaign,"Probably the best campaign in the whole game. Every desktop pilot should go through this one and learn how to handle a fighter jet. Disclaimer: Don't pay attention to the overall rating on Steam, it's been brought down by noobs who don't understand what they're buying and why!

An awesome atmospheric campaign that takes you through all the main stages of learning to pilot and use the L-39 Albatross training aircraft in combat. Each mission explains and tests the quality of a wide range of tasks from piloting to types of combat approaches.
Highly recommended for DCS beginners as a first campaign, as completing it will give you all the necessary basics of piloting and will significantly ease the transition to more serious modern aircraft. Old campaign. User unfriendly. One tiny mistake (or even slightly out-of-parameters) and you have to re-do the whole mission. Sometimes the messaging about what went wrong is missing. No long supported by its russian developers, nor brought up-to-spec with the latest inclusions in the core game. Do not buy this. Чтобы дополнение заработало: придется отдельно докупать другое дополнение, сам самолет - DCS: L-39 Albatros (+60 USD лол). Очень много вопросов и отзывов на эту тему: странно, что никто не прокомментировал до сих пор. Компания не отображается в игре. Прошу подсказать что делать либо вернуть деньги. Спасибо. прошу вернуть деньги так как самолёт не появился в игре Почему в игре не отображается купленный самолёт DCS: L-39 Albatros - Kursant Campaign купил установил с его нет в клиенте игры. Что делать? Very nice, it teaches how to fly properly! This was my first campaign in DCS. Overall I found it great addition to the already available (limited) training that DCS has for almost all types. I definitely wish every single type of aircraft in DCS had a training campaign of this sort to properly learn the airplane. Limited A-A engagement (as L-39 is), but still fun... I personally bought L-39 and this, to get myself prepped for soviet style equipment, which is, as we all know, has its unorthodox parts. 

Downside? You don't find out if you passed a lesson/mission, until you land back at the base, even if you flown the whole route. This campaign perfectly suits L-39 module in a way that they should go in a bundle. Great toolkit to practice navigation and combat application after you read some books.

If you are serious about your flying skills and starting from scratch the recommended path for Soviet planes is Yak-52 -> L-39 + Kursant -> any other Soviet plane. Just like they train in real world. 简体中文为什么不能玩。能不能退钱 我是傻逼 Nemohu hodnotit jelikož DLC nefunguje! I was hoping this campaign would hold my hand a little bit more to learn the L39.  Being shut down by the virtual instructor as a virtual trainee or ""Kursant"" in this campaign isn't fun.  The instructor ended my mission told me I needed to go study the books more.  Sir, yes, Ma'am!  I deal with enough training BS in real life that it really turned me off to the way this campaign started out.  I suppose in that way this could be a realistic.  I suppose in that way I don't like it.  Your mileage may vary. Kursant is the best campaign I have played in DCS thus far. This is a fantastic teaching tool for all the skills that real pilots learn, and which sim pilots usually don't care about. If you've played online you've probably seen (or been) [i]that player[/i]: Flying approaches way too high and fast, getting lost, asking how to use their navaids, missing wildly with their weapons, complaining about bad weather. If you have access to the L-39 (it's worth it for this campaign alone), you can apply the skills you learn in Kursant to any other airframe and will hopefully not be [i] that player[/i]. 

Despite being labeled as a training campaign, there's nothing easy about Kursant. In fact, it has many of the most difficult missions I've played in DCS. Generally speaking, in DCS campaigns you can get away with flying like a total moron. That couldn't be farther from the truth here. It doesn't slowly ease you into the hard stuff, either. Mission 2, where you must navigate with nothing more than the kneeboard, a stopwatch, and your eyes, skimming the deck at a 200m AGL limit, maintaining strict speed and timing requirements (in a crosswind to boot!) is the single hardest mission I've ever played. After many attempts, man, was it satisfying to finally get it all right. Thankfully changes to DCS's campaign system allow you to easily skip any mission that is just too hard, and for some of these I wouldn't blame you as long as you give it a proper effort - they are seriously challenging, even for a real-life pilot who's had to do it all before. The challenge is stiff, but logical - every mission builds on those previous, demanding that you master the necessary skills of takeoff, landing, and navigation before you can venture off and start blowing stuff up.

Kursant teaches you more than how to fight in the L-39. It teaches you how to aviate and navigate. Most players probably don't know that the stopwatch even exists, but here it is mandatory. It's used to calculate distance at a known airspeed, timing turns for attack runs, and planning maneuvers. You're forced to read the terrain, look for distinctive shapes in roads and rivers to determine how much you've deviated from a planned course. The briefings are incredibly dense with laundry lists of planned airspeeds, altitudes, headings, and switch settings, but if you follow them correctly you'll never fail a mission due to a procedural error. Flying within parameters is non-trivial - lots of low visibility, high winds, and turbulence, all in a touchy, lightweight jet with no autopilot. The flight instructor is voiced well, and he's very good at reminding you of the flight's action items so you're not constantly pausing to review the briefing. He's strict, but that makes passing the missions even more rewarding and force you to hone your precision flying skills - you must rise to meet the ever-more complicated and demanding flight requirements. Also, those reflector-gunsight dive angle and offset calculations make a lot more sense and seem much more accurate after you've learned how to set up a correct attack run. 

If you're the kind of player who just likes to fly the most modern airframes where everything is handled by computers, do crazy maneuvers and generally fly like shit, you'll hate this campaign. Oh my, will you loathe it. The mission completion parameters are incredibly tight, but that's how it is in real life. When you go to get your pilot's license and have to make a 360-degree turn within 50m altitude, and you oscillate all over the sky, they'll gladly take your money and tell you to try again until you get it right. It's definitely not for everyone. You have to really care about improving and becoming a good pilot not to be frustrated by this campaign, but you WILL come out of it a better pilot, and it's a glimpse into the precision and skill demanded of real jet pilots. купил а в симуляторе не отображается Прошу Вас Вернуть средства за данную покупку, Так как в самой  игре данный контент не отображается If you want to be a better pilot, this campaing is for you. Brilliant and valuable campaign. This will teach you things you don't get in any of the other aircraft but you can apply what you've learned(proper ground attack runs, radio navigation etc) in a lot of other old aircraft like the MiG-15, F-86, MiG-19, MiG-21, F-5E, and maybe even newer aircraft if you don't use EGI/GPS. Definitely worthwhile and definitely wort getting the L-39 just for this campaign. This is a really tough module because of the tight pass/fail criteria expected of you.  Maybe too realistic and demanding for arm chair pilots.  You really need a stick and throttle to progress and lots of practice, practice, practice.  Very satisfying when you eventually pass.

Dieses Spiel oder sollte ich eher sagen Programm, habe ich bereits vor einiger Zeit, durch einen random Steamkey erhalten. Da ich mich neben Steam auch sehr aktiv mit Discord beschäftige, habe ich dieses Programm für euch einmal getestet.

Es handelt sich hierbei, um eine Software namens ""Discord Rich Me! (Custom Rich Presence)"" welche vom Entwicklerstudio ""Varstep Studios"" entwickelt wurde. Wie der Name schon sagt, kann man mit diesem Programm die sogenannte ""Rich Presence"" seines Discordaccounts ändern. Für die Leute die nicht wissen was das ist, es ist die Anzeige, welche öffentlich zeigt, sofern du die Standard-Einstellungen benutzt, was du zum jeweiligen Zeitpunkt spielst. Zusätzlich kann man dieser Anzeige auch noch 2 Knöpfe hinzufügen, in denen man beispielsweise seinen Discordserver verlinken könnte. Das hört sich ja bis jetzt ganz gut an, jedoch muss ich leider diese Software eher negativ bewerten. Zum einen versprechen die Vorschaubilder sowie die Produktbeschreibung einige Features wie beispielsweise eine speicher bzw. lade Funktion einzelner Statusanzeigen, eine automatische Bearbeitung dieser und noch einiges mehr, welche gar nicht mehr im Endprodukt verfügbar sind. Desweiteren gibt es ein Haufen derartiger Scripte bereits kostenlos auf Seiten wie Github. Ebenso gibt es keinerlei Tutorials, weshalb von Benutzerfreundlichkeit kaum der Rede wert sein kann. Was für mich jedoch der größte negative Punkt ausgemacht hat, ist die Tatsache, dass dieses Programm bzw. die Nutzung derartiger ""Scripte"", gegen die Discord Terms of Services (ToS) verstößt, da es meines Wissens zu Selfbotting zählt. Zum Test habe ich jedenfalls nur meinen Zweitaccount verwendet. Die Software hat im übrigen, ganz zum erstaunen meinerseits, sogar 3 Errungenschaften zum freischalten. Der Preis von rund 2€ wäre an sich okay, wenn man wenigstens alles geboten bekommen würde, was einem versprochen wird. Da dies jedoch nicht der Fall ist und man desweiteren auch wie bereits erwähnt kostenlose Möglichkeiten hat, diese Funktionen zu verwenden, kann ich den Preis nicht nachvollziehen.

Ich persönlich rate euch eher von der Software und der damit verbundenen Nutzung dringendst ab. Das Programm ist in meinen Augen auf Steam einfach fehl am Platz. Müsst ihr wissen.

👑 [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43242924/]Weitere Spielbewertungen[/url] 👑 After the new update its imposible to use... U cant even use stuff like %weather or something to show the weather in a location in the rpc u cant just show cpu stats in the normal editor u have to use the prebuild... You cant display the current time as it was in the older version.... Better than other rich presence apps like CustomRPC It has some kind of cool features but its quite buggy. Buttons don't respond and freezes do happen. Just download customRP from github. terrible bad copy of discord rp which is free No abre;¿algún buen samaritano que me ayudé a abrir esta cosa? pö Really nice tool to have a bit of fun using Discord! O Software tem uma proposta muito interessante, porém não consegui fazer o que eu queria, espero avancem bastante com o projeto, talvez no futuro eu volte a usar o Software. It works crookedly, you don't always get what you expect. Functions do not work the way you expect them to, some of them throw an error, some of them have to be redesigned manually.
I don't recommend it, better find a free and better working analog on github. wrateqwrwerwer be aware don't get banned dinguses Bonne application, pratique et facile d'utilisation fournie avec une documentation en anglais.
Je la recommande en tant qu'alternative de CustomRPC qui n'est pas un logiciel 100% sûr (notamment via les tentatives de phishing depuis la page de téléchargement de leur site). The UI is pretty cool but half of the Buttons doesnt even work and most of the time it doesnt work at all.
 не стоит своих денег
 D It's pretty easy to understand how to use this software if you've used something like this in the past; it works absolutely perfectly, and it is an alternative to using Discord plugins, like BetterDiscord or Vencord.

It doesn't seem to affect my CPU or GPU usage at all, even if I have the program running constantly in the background. When I used BetterDiscord, it increased my CPU and GPU usage significantly, so if you're using BetterDiscord or Vencord plugins purely for the rich presence, this is a great replacement. Took a strangely long amount of time to set up, very fiddly. id say its pretty okay for the price but you can find alternative free solutions (vencord/CRP) that lack like 2 features and work with modded clients."

2282990,Droidmals: Lavanlier Town,"I've never voted on a steam game before, but this game was so terrible that I had to say something. 2.99 is a ripoff. the combat is terrible, the story is sub-par and the game is shorter than the distance between pallet town and pewter city.

I wish I'd spent the 2.99 on some gum. It would have been more fun and lasted longer. I know my playtime isn't much, but I have some opinions on this little game. First off, as someone who recalls the false ads for a certain mobile game, all I wanted was a horror themed Pokemon game. Droidmals: Lavanlier Town totally fits that bill. My only complaint is that there is no enemy HP bar, making it difficult to see when to catch them. All and all, a fun little horror game for fans of creepypasta like Lavender Town Syndrome and Pokemon: Creepy Black. Prodotto modesto ma che riesce a fare bene quello che aveva promesso, l'atmosfera horror è ben riuscita."
1970210,Connected Hearts: Fortune Play Collector's Edition,"This was quite a good HOG game.  There was quite a variety of puzzles, but the HOG scenes themselves were entertaining too.  I didn't skip any of the puzzles, though I did skip the mini-games.  Not so fun.
The story was interesting, a rich man who sacrifices a 'loving heart' to keep the goddess Fortuna happy, kidnaps an actress named Beatrice who is in love with her fiance, Franz.  You play as both Beatrice ad Franz to escape your fate.  The bonus chapter was like half the length of the game and also quite intriguing.

One note: at a couple of times in the game you will be prompted to make a decision.  If you choose not to accept the person's offer, the game will continue but you will miss a significant scene or event.  This option is clearly marked with a red jewel.  If you want to play though it quickly, then skip them.  But otherwise they adds more depth to the story.

Recommended! ^-^ Every single game I got during the sale of this developer has some sort of problem like not being able to get a hidden coin or the mechanics of a game are so bad you have to finish it by skipping or one game the bonus chapter at the very end, the last thing to do was like done for you even though the item you need is still in your inventory so you can't finish the BC at all...no wonder these were on sale ...but really if I could get my money back for all of them I would.   I could get game play out of it but too many issues in each one to play again.   I have played these types of games for years, going back to the big fish days and these have to be the worst because as far as I am concerned this developer didn't care about if their game worked or not.  I saw other issues as well like the instructions to the puzzle games were just awful and I played all of these on easy mode but because they were just so poorly devised some you just had to skip.   nope, this is one developer I can't recommend any of their games ..too many had problems in them. chouette jeu,beau visuel Un jeu excellent! tout est bien! les graphismes, la variété des nombreux minis jeux qui ne sont pas basiques,les ambiances une réussite! beautiful game enjoyed this game  very much.

668980,Forsaken Remastered,"Good for nostalgia. Good old FPS. 
Good level designs. Good fluidity. 
Secrets everywhere. Good old cheat codes.
I didn't know I could still enjoy old games nowadays. Nostalgia bait. Runs well. Gameplay loop still holds up. Keyboard and mouse controls work perfectly right out the gate. Classic early in FPS genre.  I love it. have you remastered your foresken yet? A Blast from the past <3 
===================
I remember playing this gem back in 1998 and how wonderful it was.
Nightdive studios did a great job with remastering this game so I can play it on my 4K TV and using Xbox controller, the soundtrack , the motions and everything is really smooth and refreshing.
 honestly i kinda like this more than descent Map Editor with Steam Workshop integration for custom maps when? Pretty please? I require more!... Also fixing some bugs with running the game and staying in lobbies after a round would be cool <3 This game is really good, Its really good with the weapons and alt fires. Go play this game. I enjoy it because nostalgia. Nightdive is very good at remastering old games.

I would not recommend it to anyone normally though. 

No one plays multiplayer, there are no discount multipacks to get your friends into it; and single player is literally a ""Where the **** do I go"" but with a time limit.

Short of nostalgia; the only reason to actually play this game in the modern day is maybe if you can coerce a bunch of people to play together for a couple of evenings and it's on super sale. Looks better and feels better then in 1998 when the bought the PC version and ran it on my Compaq 386.   Brings back old memories for a guy that is now 65 years now.   My son bought this for me, for my 66th birthday.   Great birthday gift! Top Remake... endlich kann ich es wieder spielen, und das noch in 4K. Suuuper. Crashes whenever I tried to change any options and randomly crashed when in levels. Completely unplayable I listen to the Soundtrack since the release of this beauty of game back in the 90 and love the game still. The remake is from ""Descent"" quality, buy it! **Forsaken Remastered** su PC è una rinascita affascinante di un classico degli anni '90, perfettamente adatto agli amanti dei giochi retrò e degli sparatutto in prima persona. 

**Trama** 

Fps atipico, a tema futuristico dove interpretiamo uno scavatore che ricerca tesori in dei tunnel, non privi di pericoli e nemici da affrontare....tutto qui.

**Punti di forza**:

1. **Grafica Rinnovata**: 

La remaster offre un notevole miglioramento grafico rispetto all'originale, con texture aggiornate e supporto per risoluzioni più alte. 

Questo permette di apprezzare meglio i dettagli dei tunnel e dei nemici.

2. **Gameplay Coinvolgente**: 

Il combattimento frenetico e le dinamiche di volo in stile 6DoF (six degrees of freedom) sono entusiasmanti e mantengono alta l'adrenalina.

3. **Colonna Sonora Epica**: 

La colonna sonora è immersiva e ben si adatta all'ambientazione distopica, contribuendo a creare un'atmosfera di tensione e avventura.

4. **Modalità Multiplayer**: 

Il multiplayer aggiunge una dimensione di competizione extra, perfetta per sfidare amici e giocatori di tutto il mondo.

**Aspetti Negativi**:

1. **Curve di Apprendimento**: 

Per i nuovi giocatori, la meccanica del volo può risultare complicata e richiedere un po' di tempo per essere padroneggiata.

2. **Ripetitività**: 

Alcune missioni possono risultare ripetitive, specialmente quando si tratta di affrontare ondate di nemici in sequenza.

3. **Narrativa Poco Sviluppata**: 

La trama è piuttosto basilare, lasciando poco spazio per un coinvolgimento emotivo più profondo con i personaggi e la storia. Always loved this game since I was very young. Had it on the PS1 years ago.
Nice to see it's been polished up and taken care of.
I would like to see the option to manually change which music track is playing per level though, as some are different from the PS1 version. 
 Still one of the best 6DoF games on the planet.  If you want to test your first person shooter skills this is the game that will do it. Altro omega shooter retro che mi ha fatto male alla testa.
Però è davvero originale This game gives me both really strong nostalgic vibes from my childhood and a strong need to continue flying my drone - albeit without weapons of course. ;)

It sure is dated in looks, handling and sometimes cryptic levels but it makes up for the disadvantages in greatly filling out a niche FPS even today.

The controls are floaty but direct (like it's supposed to be), controller support is great and can be made easier (for beginners).
The difficulty is either easy or kinda hard, depending on your skills and ability to decipher the sometimes cryptic level design. 
Lenghtwise, it's okay even for the full price (17€) but I recommend getting it for a discount.
I can't really say anything about the multiplayer since I was so focused on the singleplayer.

All in all, I think that Nightdive Studios made a great remaster out of the original material which I can strongly recommend to try out and I really wish that more devs would take on the 6DOF-genre.
 A fun 6DOF shooter from the good ol’ days of the PS1 generation, remastered and polished up by Nightdive for modern computers to work flawlessly. I don’t know if you’ve ever had the misfortune in recent times to purchase a game on Steam designed for Windows 95/98 and try to get it to run on a modern system with Windows 10/11, but usually the games won’t even launch at all without installing some kind of fan-made patch or mod. Honestly, Steam shouldn’t sell those old games without a huge warning mentioning that the game doesn’t run without tweaks. There’s quite a few people who have switched to PC from console in the last few years and they may not be aware of this issue.

This game is a fun flying shooter that is reminiscent of Descent, although I would say that this has better graphics (even before it was remastered). There’s not much of a narrative going on in this game, but it does have some environmental storytelling and is worth playing regardless. It also runs well on the Steam Deck, right out of the box. If you’re getting older like me and you remember this game from the 90s, you should enjoy experiencing it again in the best version available and experiencing the nostalgia of playing something that is heavy with those 1990s vibes that make the game look and feel so different from any game released in modern times. Pick it up on sale, I got it for less than $10 during one of the big seasonal sales. Best dam game I've ever played"

1664220,TRAIL OUT,"É difícil falar isso, mas Trail Out melhor que Wreckfest. Por mais que Wreckfest seja polido e redondo, Trail Out é mais divertido e variado. Muitos modos e carros pra escolher, a história pastelão com cutscenes toscas de um jeito bom. As pistas, que são muitas, têm variedade de iluminação (até ciclo dia-noite), perigos, rampas ingrimes, atalhos etc. A trilha sonora também não deve nada. A IA na dificuldade comum é meio fraca mas oferece um desafio bem balanceado no ""Difícil"". A customização de carros é decente, mas é suficiente pra valer a pena trocar de carros periodicamente e manter três ""builds"" (corrida asfalto, corrida off-road e derby).

Mas o que esse jogo deve é em alguns sons de batida e motores. Nos modos derby você passa mais tempo rodando em círculos e são mais chatos que corridas ou mini-jogos. Na campanha tem alguns pontos que você precisa ""farmar"" fãs nas corridas livres e é entediante. Além de muitos pequenos bugs que eu passo pano para um jogo indie, mas para um que já lançou DLC já poderia ter consertado. ебаный сырой кусок дерьма 10 пируэтов, 10 дисетерных сальто мортале на ровном месте из 10 Начну сразу с плохого: озвучка г0вн0, звучит как из унитаза. Вероятно, что озвучено при помощи ИИ, и если это так, то можно простить ""актерские способности"", но качество звучания - это прям мрак, а вкупе с корявой детализацией персонажей, вообще убожество. Даже не понятно, зачем герои игры так нелепо матюкаются - не в тему, не красиво, без эмоций, ну а мат ради мата - это такое себе (хотя я не противник горячего словца). Лучше бы обошлись какими-нибудь артами в стиле комиксов, оставив только трассы и тачки. Ведь пока ты гоняешься - вопросов к детализации и графике, в целом, поменьше.

Ведь игра выглядит вполне приемлемо. Всё разлетается, взрывается, дребезги, осколки, вот это вот всё, даже время суток и погодные условия меняются (слишком быстро, но эффектно). Локации разнообразные, трассы запоминающиеся (потому что это калька с оригинала?), интересные и сложные. Очень много деталей и почти всё разлетается в куски. Крошилово на трассе вообще довольно весёлое, а отдельный поклон разработчикам за правильно подобранный саундтрек! Музыка в Trail Out, на мой скромный взгляд, это самое лучшее, что есть в игре! Как им это удалось? Забойные треки попадают в самое сердечко, и удерживают меня в игре каким-то магическим образом! Возможно это главная причина, почему я вообще возвращался в игру. Пожалуй, закину эти треки себе на флэшку, чтобы слушать в пути, главное не сорваться и не начать крушить других участников дорожного движения в своем городе.

А по идее, в игре должен удерживать сюжет, ведь так? И он, как будто бы, есть, но такой, что лучше бы и не было. Как я уже говорил, лучше бы использовали рисованные комиксы, а не эти кошмарно анимированные корявые 3D-фигурки с убогой озвучкой. Чтобы удержать смотрящего на весь этот стыд и срам, в игру добавлены пасхалки. Вообще отсылки идут за отсылкой, одна за другой, видно что игра на этом держится. По факту, это даже не клон FlatOut, а пародия, получается, с множеством отсылок на вообще всё подряд. Тут вам и на первоисточник FlatOut в том числе, вы легко узнаете в персонажах героев GTA:SA, MK, Форсажа, даже машины отсылают на советский автопром и GTA, Терминатор, Форсаж и т.д., да даже сами фразочки героев - отсылки, а с приобретенными DLC вы найдете отсылки на другие фильмы и игры. Сам по себе сюжет - просто существует. Это не плохо, но и не хорошо, ведь главное - реализация, а с этим тут беда. Хотя, если прислушаться к правилу ""Настолько плохо, что даже хорошо"", то можно забить на это гаечный ключ и просто угореть на трассах.

При этом нужно отметить, что дефолтное управление автомобилем в игре какое-то несуразное, вялое, дохлое, непослушное. Я подёргал ползунки чувствительности и скорости поворота, и мне удалось получить нужный результат. Играться стало сильно приятнее. Это, конечно, всё еще не FlatOut, но уже довольно близко! А может во мне сказывается 600 часов в Forza, 90 часов в GRID Legends и 30+ накатанных часов в NFS HP Remastered, которые я относительно недавно имел честь пройти на ""Платины"".
В любом случае, терпения мне не занимать, стоит посмотреть на мою ""платину"" GRIP Combat Racing. Поэтому я собрал волю в кулак и осилил старт Trail Out, ведь на первых порах игра довольно сложно принимает новых игроков: сложностью, управлением, физикой, отсутствием валюты на нормальные авто и доступ к ним. Даже проиграв, вы получается какие-то денежки и фанатов (последние влияют на доступ к новым машинкам и небольшие донаты). Поэтому раз за разом обкатываясь, вы всё равно растёте, а со временем получите заветный новый автомобиль и наконец-то не будете глотать пыль на старте каждой гонки, а сразу ринетесь в бой. Нужно перетерпеть этот ад, и играть станет интереснее. Важно отметить, что при первой попытке поиграть в Trail Out, я забросил игру после первого босса. Да, это моя второй ""заезд"" и успешно забрал ""платину"".

Прошёл гонку, зашёл в ""соцсеть"", собрал донаты и награды за ачивки (кстати, не припомню, чтобы получение достижений в игре кто-нибудь хоть раз так адаптировал, разработчикам респект). Повторять до победного. Правда меню мне показалось не очень удобным, особенно с геймпадом, особенно учитывая тот факт, что при управлении с геймпада почему-то часто пропадает связь с меню, приходится тянуться за мышей, чтобы решить проблему. Бесит. Надеюсь это когда-нибудь починят.

А бегать по меню приходится довольно часто, т.к. для покупки хотя бы одной машинки не хватит одного нажатия кнопки ""Купить"". Сначала вы покупаете остов, далее ремонтируете кузов (выбираете один из трёх вариантов по прочности), затем выбираете двигатель (также один их трёх вариантов), всякие ""автоштуки"", колёса и нитро. Визуально разница будет лишь при выборе кузова, колес и покраски, а в плане начинки: нет никакого смысла покупать ""железо"" 1 уровня, все будут ставить сразу 3 уровень нитро, движка и тд. Можно было вообще это вырезать из игры, ограничившись выбором кузова (т.к. 1 уровень кузова не портит классический вид знакомых автомобилей, будь то ""Запорожец"", ""Жигули"", ""Буханка"" или ""Восьмёрка"").

Забавно, что разработчики продолжили обновлять свою игру и даже выпустили её на других платформах и консолях. И когда я сказал про обновления, я не имел в виду ""просто добавляют платные карпаки"", нет. Если я все правильно понял, то с крупными апдейтами в игру завезли абсолютно новый транспорт для игры (который вообще изначально не был предусмотрен, я имею в виду мотоциклы) и даже зомби режим (представьте себе открытую карту с кучей гуляющих по городу зомбарей, больших боссов, перестрелками, можно даже выйти из автомобиля).  Я опробовал зомби-режим, интересно, занятно, но все это сделано на том же уровне, что и вся игра, т.е. как-то средне, хот и весело. Идея Trail Out хороша, но не нова, как и зомби-режим, хотя он в целом меняет всю игру, ещё чуть-чуть и можно будет вообще машины убрать и сделать квест или адвенчур, либо гта-клон. Не знаю, вроде все выглядит классно, и звучит круто... Но играется все это как-то не очень. Лучше просто уделить внимание классическому режиму, отполировать проект, чтобы не лагали текстуры в начале гонки, нормально анимировать персонажей, поработать над освещением в катсценах. А еще игра несколько раз регистрировала победу сопернику, который ехал позади меня, выдавая мне, что я отстал от него на какие-нибудь 0.00.20 сек, хотя даже в ""фотофинише"" видно, что соперник находится на корпус позади. Система штрафов в игре не предусмотрена вроде бы? Тогда что это?

И да, девки в игре страшные! Ну, кроме Юджин Тян, над ней постарались.

В итоге, мы имеем угарную пародию легендарной старенькой FlatOut (этакий ""FlatOut у нас дома""), с сотнями отсылок на всё про всё, крутым саундтреком, разнообразными трассами и неплохим визуалом… с одной оговоркой - этому клону далеко до славы первоисточника во многих аспектах, но учитывая застой в жанре - Trail Out просто Must Have, но не стоит относиться к нему серьезно, при детальном рассмотрении можно сильно разочароваться. Например, в игре нет мультиплеера, добротная музыка слегка попахивает плагиатом, трассы надоедают, ИИ неадекватно ускоряется вместе с игроком... Но я знаю гоночную аркаду в тысячи раз хуже этой, помните Lada Racing Club?

[spoiler][url=store.steampowered.com/curator/6858508]Посмотри другие пройденные мною игры ^_^ [/url][/spoiler] игра топ Жаль нельзя поставить нейтральную оценку.
В целом, игра подарила много положительных эмоций. В частности, от того как некоторые элементы игры работают в совокупности: Музыка, некоторые эффекты, интерактивные взаимодействия на карте, взаимодействие между тобой и неписями. Особенно, если играешь в первый раз. 
Но, также есть вещи, что портят сильно впечатление, что тоже работает в совокупности.
Пример:
Физика - очень вымученный элемент игры. Видел ещё на ранней стадии это дело - там был просто ужас. Но атмосфера вытаскивала.
Неоптимизированное поведение мобов на картах - В зависимости от обновлений, поведение мобов менялось от карте к карте. Т.е., на одних картах - нетянут конкуренцию мобы. На других - нужно прям сильно постараться, чтобы конкуренцию составить уже самому.
Большое разнообразие машин - не имеет смысла. На некоторых картах, ты просто вынужден брать определённые машины. По факту, ОП тачки, если так можно высказаться. Т.Е., иллюзия выбора, грубо говоря. Что понятно далеко не сразу и вынуждает заниматься фармом, ибо не угадываешь с машиной. 
И эти элементы, создают прям о-о-очень большой и не нужный гемор на ровном месте. На повышенной сложности ИИ, разумеется. На лёгком не играл. 
Но, то актуально, если ты проходишь игру не в первый раз и выбиваешь все золотые медали.
Для первого ознакомления и получения определённых эмоций - рекомендую.
Но вот на счёт перепрохождений и игры на постоянку - вопрос. Хоть в игре и куча контента, включая доп. режимы (Например прикольный режим зомби, что три раза я проходил - и на последней стадии застревал фатально в текстурах. В итоге, так и не закончил :D). A lot like Wreckfest, another arcade racer with crashing. [h2]Такое ощущение что запустил vehicle пресет (даже не ""advanced"") в UE. [/h2]

Мб на геймпаде или руле колёса не так резко разворачивает но на клаве эт ппц, возможно [b]FInterp[/b]  (и его настройка) решил бы проблему [i](в этом прям мега не фан).[/i]
Помимо этого непонятно, зачем в грузовиках так высоко центр тяжести.

[i]Даже стало складываться ощущение что UE прям вообще не для гонок.[/i]
Идеи и визуально все нормально, но механика слабовата. 

Играбельно, местами даже хорошо, но хотелось большего.
[i](и неплохо было бы подучить как флаг Белоруссии выглядит, а то как-то нереалистично)[/i] Первые впечатления, просто какая-то лажа в плане физики, не понятно работающая сложность, невозможно играть с нормальным фпс на gtx 1060 6 гб, ну да возможно процессор портит картину - i7-4770 обычный, не спорю, общая трешовость ещё ладно, местами даже забавно, но просто с игры пригорает.

Обновлено: впечатления уже получше, но начало игры прям дизбаланс если честно.

Не знаю как дальше пойдёт, ну победить  Комрада, Биг Чиза и Юджин Тян не так сложно. Can't rebind controls, it's pretty ugly, the handling is bad. Is the Flatout nostalgia really this great? Wreckfest is a WAY BETTER racing game. 

Fuckin temu ass Flatout spiritual successor....


OH OH OH!  The sounds are dogshit too, just crap. Great fun, lots of car crashes, decent graphics Как по мне это лучший инди наследник легендарного flatout
НО как и все выскажусь насчет физики, ОНА НЕ ДЛЯ ВСЕХ ВООБЩЕ НЕ ДЛЯ ВСЕХ!
Лично я люблю аркадки и мне понравилась идея сделать физику не предсказуемой только вот непонятно, специально или случайно?
Машину вполне интерестно подлавливать, лично я ни когда не был уверен что на этот раз войду в поворот но потом приучился и понял особненность.
Трассы интересные и разнообразные, а про режимы я вообще молчу, конечно не прям великие разроботки  но здесь намешано многое из-за чего даже после карьеры было интерестно играть и я уверен зайду ни раз покатать за михалыча)
Насчет оптимизации 1660s отлично подошла для максимальных настроек но процессор 4770 слишком слабый для обработки экшена в этой игре так что советую что-то помощнее, но даже с просадками приятно было играть.
За игру встретил где-то 3 бага  ито некритичные которые не влияют на геймплей. While the handling was a bit too floaty for my taste it was still fun enough to finish career mode, and this game made me realize how much i would love to play a new motorstorm game! dg jogo mt bom e altamente nostalgico pra quem jg burnout e flatout норм

669320,Nation War:Chronicles,"我用48小时证明这是个非常垃圾的游戏 它让我一玩，就停不下来。对与我来说比起第二作好玩 。 这游戏就只能挨揍吗？建立的军队根本无法控制无法移动无法攻击别国，你是自己动还是需要点，总得有个说法吧？！真是无语，其实，刚开始买的时候就觉得有bug,还是不忍心，想着是不是我的问题啊，结果3小时了，我的城堡由5个，只剩1个了，宣战了就只能被胖揍丧师失地，好感败光-240614 Fine map painting war heavy Europa Universalis, but buggy and unfinished. 国战列国志传
周朝这个时期的单机游戏是比较少的，国战列国志传，允许你扮演战国七雄，也可以扮演战国时期的一些小卡拉米。我随机到过夜郎！
我玩的是教学篇，越国。说是教学片，实际可以一直玩下去。
1.体制：刚开始是部落联盟，后面可以选择一些别的体制。后面体制主要是有一些减部队购买费60%，加部队维持费50%的政策变化。
2.经济：可以买卖物品有木头，马，金属，口粮，石材之类的。前期要多买粮食和木头建造部队，前中期顶梁柱部队轻装徒兵。主要是只要钱，木头和口粮。后面枪兵之类的要大量金属或者马匹。贸易界面，右下点卖出可以任命一个商人，商人任命在屏幕左下有个相框，点一下任命一个商人。
3.人才：没事可以去看看人才，运气好可以招募历史名将，可以一直使用不会老死。例如白起，孔子，孙子，李牧。打仗的时候多照顾一下他们，别让打灭了部队被俘虏了。记得用钱加一下忠诚。
4.外交：外交做的可以，可以和别的国家联盟，送钱提升好感度。这个游戏里的国家都有盟友，所以你也需要一个。不然就会有1打4的尴尬局面，之前玩没看到有个小国附庸楚国，打了一下惹了马蜂窝，打了4个小时还丢了3个城，和楚国赶紧议和。议和后看了眼楚国，竟然可以军事联盟，坐上了飞机起飞，看看盟友楚国他们打谁，你跟着宣战谁，攻城掠地轻松不少。把卫国，宋国土地吞并不少。膨胀了造起了枪兵，枪兵配李牧5000人，打好汉1000人有300多，一般就100左右。
外交也要任命一个外交官，点联盟或者提高友好度，屏幕中间会出来一个空相框图片，点一下空相框，就可以选择一个外交官去完成使命，外交会有延迟，稍后会回信通知你成功或者失败。
5。军事：合纵连横，还是需要盟友分担压力，然后轻装徒兵走起，按空格，把游戏停了以后慢慢选，慢慢抉择。主要是战场大，全地图，电脑还会穿插去打你的后方城市，电脑部队也多，多造点1000人的防守轻装徒兵，所以要保自己的城的同时攻击对面的城，围城的时候可以点部队选择全力攻城，但是你的损失也会加大。月初好像会补兵，不过需要你的城里有预备役，和足够的出兵财物。预备役，点一下城，点造兵，把鼠标停到兵牌上面可以看到具体的预备役数量。这都是自己摸索的，有更详细的可以指出。可以给部队停止补给，省点钱，战时还可以开启战时经济，经济收入在打仗的时候变多。
重点打仗的时候月末把部队移动到自己的城市附近，月初可以补充部队，条件就是城市有多余的预备役和装备物资就可以补兵，打仗的时候千万不要把部队补给关了，广积粮缓称王！
打仗一定要空格暂停慢慢来，不然会被电脑打穿。空格后和电脑盟友抢起城来也更容易一些。
6、稳定度：这个也是军事里的，可以在军事界面选择消耗政策点和钱提高稳定度，稳定度低就会出梁山好汉，还会攻城。有攻城提示就空格去看看，调兵去处理一下，你打仗的时候稳定度低，好汉就会来捣乱。
7、城市：可以建造核心，任命官员，建造部队和一些建筑。核心比较重要建造以后才可以造部队和镇压叛乱，降低叛乱值，选择调高自制可以降低叛乱值，但是自制值高于50%，又不能选择城市的具体发展重点。
8、科技：选择自己的科技，研究后就可以使用，军事科技最明显，刚开始只有4种初始兵种，军事科技以后就能造枪兵之类的高科技兵种了。
这么好的大战略游戏，最主要是有免费版《国战春秋》可以试玩，可以空格键暂停游戏，所以你可以慢慢的玩，有事也可以存档，下次再玩。
而且有祈祷可以加强军事，丰收，稳定。成功自然好，但是有时会失败，反而对自己不利！
里面有贷款，没用过，有更激进的玩法吧！ 垃圾游戏，QQ群踢了我几次，今年除夕踢我，哎，1和2必须给差评。 副本再多一点就好了 1和2都有，1没玩过，当时就是因为便宜才买的，玩过2代，只能说还行 辣鸡 我给好评是因为支持该国产游戏，也是我喜欢的主题。但是建筑、造兵和军队控制极其不人性化，没有多地一键建造。一打仗军队满天飞，战争前期还得AI控制，差不多打完才转为人工控制，一打起来太乱了。 收入快出的的也快 shit game untranslated and unfinished abandoned for another game. run off with your money. dont buy waste of money. 不好 还行，支持一波 看着很好玩，自己去玩，被人机玩。让人心态崩的几点：1：敌人在你领地里乱逛，你也打不到他们，就问你气不气。2：首都3,2下就被攻破了，一点用都没。3：别人攻城，你守军就是装饰，敌人点城，点完就跑，然后就想这个1。4：税收一个月才几十块钱，这周朝里的城池都这么穷的吗？5：外交，没使者，跟大哥混，你想美了。6：你和你附属国一起打敌人，敌人攻破的城全被附属国拿走。7：同盟国也一样，太气人，你去夺回地，还被同盟国欺负了 我真是不明白为什么我的1000人在对着空气乱戳啥呢 真他妈弱智的士兵站着看别人打 好就是好

1384400,LA Monsters,"I loved the narration. It was a cool game to let play out while I ate some fruit.

Be aware there is a scene with bright flashing. 6/10 ‎ ☀️ ⠀ Could not get it to work, very sad.
Windows 11 nice laptop, music was neat :( Bu atmosferik etkileşimli video romanda Josh ve Sid ile Los Angeles'ın çorak arazisinde seyahat edin. Only buy this on Tuestays and Fristays. Not a good game, but it was a Stayte of mind. Rest in peace David Stay. [h1]Before I played LA Monsters, I had a small pp, no friends, no gf, depression, and no life. These things havent changed, but the game is pretty good[/h1] this shit is so random, the story sounds like it was written by a child, the visuals are cool af, and the guy narrating is just a goofy ass fella. I love it Ебанина A really cute ""visual novel"" with no interaction but a great OST and good voice acting
Talks about two brothers in a post-apocalyptic setting trying to save their parents from a terrible ""CROW""

It's free and just around 20 min to see/play. Just download it, play it and review it yourselves! we all know that some games are so bad they can be funny, but this is just painfully bad. epilepsy warning too btw. story is acceptable but the narration is fucking terrible and kinda concerning honestly, this man doesnt sound like hes in a healthy state of mind LA Monsters is not a game, it's an e-book/audio book (""Visual novel"" is another term that writers use when trying to disguise an e-book as a game) that's been launched on Steam as a game, despite not being one.  As a visual/interactive novel, this doesn't feature any notable gameplay, it's just a lot of clicking through badly written dialogue that would never have been accepted or published in print, which presents the question, ""How did something this badly written end up on Steam?"".  When someone hoping to become an author is unable to get published in print, they spend $100 and dump their high school fan-fiction onto Steam, under the guise of a game.

The e-book is presented badly with some weird schizophrenic art that looks like they took some scenes from other games or random Blender scenes, put and ugly filter over it, then put stick figures on with MS-Paint.  I'm not sure what the point of that is.  It's a badly written story about two brothers who traverse the ""wasteland"" of Los Angeles.  

Visual novels/e-books are tedious at best... imagine the best novel you ever read, be that Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy or 2001: A Space Odyssey or Twilight (if you have terrible taste in literature), but then translate that to a format where the words dribble out and you have to click your mouse every time you wanted to read the next sentence, instead of just turning the pages. You'd think it was garbage.  

Now imagine that experience, but with much worse writing (because if these guys could write professionally, they'd be published authors and this would be on shelves in bookstores, and they wouldn't have to pay Valve $100 to self-publish this on Steam), and you have your average Steam e-book.

While this is free, it's bad, and badly written.  A basic requirement for me to recommend games to people is that they have to be games... and this e-book isn't a game at all.  My gaming rig is not a Kindle.  If you're on Steam but not looking for games, but are looking for free, high quality, well written e-books and audio books, Project Gutenberg has literally thousands, all much better than this. 3LA5monsters Trippy as this game is, it just doesn’t keep my attention. It also performs really badly for what it is, and the overall tone alongside the improvisation by the different narrators seems like it would work better in a comedy game, whereas this game would be much better suited to a more sombre tone. Even the music, which is by far my favourite part of the game, isn’t extensive enough, with the same few tracks looping for all 39 frames. A really badly programmed joke of an engine displaying this non-interactive VN in the most  obnoxious way possible. The bad graphics are made even worse with the help of some annoying hipster filters. 
You're never sure when you'll have to click the ""NEXT"" button or when the game will decide by itself to chain several pages one after the other in bad sychronization with the narration. 
The narration, done apparently by a hobo, is the most interesting thing in this software, if you want...
The story is okay. It sounds like it was written by a kid in the 80s or something. Or maybe it's just that the authors are very dedicated to adhering to the analog/retrowave  meme. That would explain the insistance on namedropping ""VHS tapes"". The whole thing is made more tragic if you imagine it's something that the hobo narrator wrote on a sheet of paper as a kid, and kept in his pockets while living on the street.
 Anyway I'm not sure you'll want to subject yourself to this unpleasant experience just for that banal story. It reminded me of many old movies and cartoons exalting the ""childhood innocence"" meme, and how overused that theme had been in the past.
Children aren't really innocent or magical and now that I'm older I suspect the people who wrote those old stories were a bit too much into children, if you get my drift.
Anyway...the fact that this game is free doesn't make it good because your time isn't free.


[h1](follow my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33882793/]GenXPlayers[/url] for more retro and indie reviews)[/h1] It's more of a slideshow of pretty drawings with dialogue that lags behind than an actual game, despite it being referred to as interactive. I think there should be an option to disable the narration, but I didn't mind it too much. It was more so the lag that annoyed me. I'm not sure whether to recommend it or not, considering it's not much of a game, but I think it's worth ""playing"" for the sake of the story and art, even though I didn't really understand what was going on. я думал это игра, а оказалось что это слайдшоу в 5 фпс The narrator from P.T. drank a metric ton of PBR, told me a story that I was utterly baffled by, and used an art style that  fascinated me all while utilizing a visual novel format that made my gaming pc lag and it doesn't even lag when playing Cyberpunk 2077 on it's highest settings. 

It was interesting enough to power through all of that so it's a ""yes"" from me.

2370060,Essential Power,"미아와 베로니카, 그녀들은 한 국가의 최고통수권자가 내린 비상계엄령을 해제하는 것보다 더 빨리[i](거의 1분만에)[/i] 모든 도전과제를 해제합니다. 거기다 성적인 요소는 나오지도 않으니··· 안심하십시오, 대한민국의 남성분들. 이 두 여성의 활약으로 그대들의 오늘밤은 건전하고 안전합니다. [b]Girls can do anything.[/b] 고달픈 일상에 찾아온 평화로운 한때를 누리시길·····. Essential Power is a dating simulator and visual romance novel for all ages. With great renderings, the game stands out for its simplicity, offering an almost kinetic visual experience. Player choices are limited, essentially revolving around deciding whether to pursue a romance or friendship with the female character.

[h3]Story and Characters[/h3]
The story begins with the protagonist going to visit his sister Veronica, a student who works as a waitress in her spare time. The player, who works as a system administrator at a design company, is encouraged by Veronica to step away from work a bit and focus more on personal life.

In addition to Veronica, the game introduces Mia, a co-worker of the protagonist, who is visibly stressed with work demands. Following his sister's advice, the player strikes up a conversation with Mia, opening up the possibility of developing a relationship beyond the professional environment.

[h3]Mystical Elements[/h3]
As the story progresses, a mystical element is introduced through Mia, who shares with a friend about strange dreams she has been having, dreams she doesn’t understand. Although the protagonist does not directly explore this mystery, it adds an interesting layer to the narrative, suggesting there is something deeper going on.

[h3]Interactivity and Gameplay[/h3]
Although Essential Power features high-quality graphics and an intriguing premise, the game lacks interactivity and narrative options. Additionally, the game is quite short and can be completed in less than 30 minutes. For players who prefer a more dynamic and engaging experience, this duration and linearity may be disappointing. However, for those who enjoy a quick narrative with character development and a touch of mystery, Essential Power can be a pleasant and satisfying experience.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
Essential Power is a game that attracts with its simplicity and charming characters, along with the intriguing mystical element. However, it may not appeal to players looking for a deeper narrative, more choices, and a longer gameplay experience. Horrible, waste of time and money.. do not buy this save your 5 bucks Short nice story. https://youtu.be/kDqW3LNGfSQ 

https://rumble.com/v2m7gtc-essential-power-gameplay-indie-visual-novel-ending.html 

This is a very short visual novel, with just 1 choice for you to make, the dialogue is boring and childish and the price is kind of spicy for what it offers. Now with the good things about it, the characters are detailed, that's it. Imo this should've been a free game."
758170,Krampus Quest,"this game is SLOW STEADILY PUMPING INTO a vague smack in MY EFFING FACE VABBLED INTO A DROWNING GLASS OF CRAP Controls are absolutely atrocious. The game is buggy and doesn't always respond in the way you'd expect it to (e.g. hook jumps feel awkward and wrong). Projectiles, hooks, jumping and just about everything else is sluggish. Restarting the level (or game?) after running out of lives isn't great when at least half of it comes from issues with controls, unavoidable damage, or bugs. It's largely fine on paper, but the issues in execution hold it back significantly. Could be a great short game if these issues were resolved. Octodad metroidvanias aren't fun. Pass until issues are fixed. The game is obviously close to castlevania. The experience I had when playing the game was...ok. It wasn't a great experience even with the issues I'll talk about but it wasn't a horrible one either. In fairness I've only played about 15 minutes so I couldn't get deep enough into the game to say how good it could be. The biggest issues I encountered have to do with the really slow combat. Pressing the button to throw the whip takes a second for the game to respond. Another issue is how slowly the enemies react when getting hit. It feels like those issues go hand in hand but it gets so difficult to play through that I decided to stop playing and uninstall it. I would come back to it if those issues are fixed and give it another try. svin roligt spel, nostalgin är ett faktum, barndomens 8-bits action är tillbaka =) First of all, this game need controller / gamepad support ASAP.  Other that that, I have next to no complaints. Krampus Quest is fair, controls well, and an excellent throwback to some of the best SNES / PS1 era platformers. 

C- without controller 

A- with controller i like it but i think the controls should be better, other than that the game is great I purchased this on a whim to do a Christmas gaming video on it, but was pleasantly surprised to find a competent Castlevania clone that played well. The only real detriment to this game is the lack of controller support and some other minor issues. But otherwise, anyone looking for a game with a classic Castlevania sensibility with a generous portion of upgradeable abilities should be satisfied with this. 

For the developers, if you guys will add in controller support, autosaving and go back and fix a few typos, then this will be the perfect holiday title. Cheers! I have to ajust my review to a recommendation because the developer updated the game. It now has a basic save feature (although you still start from the beginning of the map after loading a save -not at the merchants tent where you saved the game - but you keep money and equipment). And hitboxes seem to work fine now!

Nonetheless it is (at least for me) a very difficullt game. Old school jump and run. If you like to be challenged then I recommend this game. Until now I was not able to leave the first sector, got stomped in the second boss fight. But with some training I will beat that boss, too.

I really like the graphics and the music so I am looking forward to christmas time when I will play it again. Never expected to see Krampus first come to life as a game through a retro-style platformer but boy is it good!
As the Krampus hyoe accumulated days before release, I was really excited to try out a Krampus game.
I have to say that im really impressed with what I've played so far, it would fit perfectly onto an old NES cartridge.
Only downside is that I wished the mood was darker, seeing as we're Krampus and we kinda consume souls to upgrade our arsenal, I figured i'd be hearing some more castlevania type music rather than your average chip tunes.
All in all, Krampus Quest is an excellent entry into the forbidden territories of Krampus genre games. 
Great job Frozen Rose!

3273850,Spooky Dwellers 3,"IKIGames makes some of the most underrated M3 games out there; I've always found it surprising that they don't get more attention.  The newest Spooky Dwellers features the skeletal ghost writer (no, really, he's an author) Thomassino, who would like your help in figuring out why a certain house is filled with ghosts and to re-house them in a better place.  (Maybe he's secretly territorial and wants the house for himself?  I dunno, but love that pink wig he's rocking.)

There are 90 levels in the first map and 60 in the second (CE) map.  Your goal is to remove all the ghosts and any colored tiles in the playfield.  Usually, the ghosts are hanging out on the edges and you must aim the light beams by removing obstacles and positioning other gadgets to get the lights to shine on the ghosts to scare them off.  The CE map begins featuring creepy critters who are inside the playfield and must be matched next to enough times.  New features to this game are fog, some of which reappears after a certain amount of moves, along with spider web obstacles which must be burned strategically, and chained pieces (which oddly will block light beams, while fog does not).  There are quite a few minigame types which appear every so often between levels in the first map and more in the CE extras: HOS, jigsaw puzzle variant where you rotate the sections into place, mazes, a ""click on the sequence"" game, and a bounce-to-hit game where you aim objects to collect coins.  The mazes were my favorite and I hope there will be more in future IKIGames releases.  The other CE extras are some wallpapers and character stories courtesy of our hero ghost writer.

Thomassino wants you to build a Playground for the evicted ghosts to live in, but IMO the Playground scene building in this game is a step backwards from the wonderful sim-game side project Spooky Dwellers 2 featured.  If you have a lot of patience where you're willing to play through nearly the whole game to fulfill all the Playground goals, you can get a really good looking scene built - and the Playground expands about 30% bigger when the CE levels unlock.  But if you simply want to get all the ghosts re-housed and the achievements associated with the Playground ASAP, you're stuck with building a really ugly scene, albeit you will get all the goals done with the Playground rapidly (I've done it by the halfway mark of the first map).

The overall difficulty has been stepped up a little bit with each installment of this series, and this one is no exception.  There are levels which can be rendered impossible if you do things in the wrong order, and that red fog can be rather maddening.  The game is still plenty doable if you play in relaxed or normal modes, and there are lots of customization options in the game to tweak the difficulty more subtly such as being able to generate powerups with bigger matches or not and having powerups break obstacles or not.  But beware of that new ""expert"" mode.  It pulls no punches whatsoever and is a real nightmare to get through!  I accuse a certain beta tester of completely breaking that mode, sorry...  Otherwise, an interesting and different M3."

 This is tough. Please Steam, just make a third -neutral- recommendation option to make things easier to review. Ok?

I got this game because it looked interesting to me. It has that minimalistic design I like, it plays smoothly, there are no bugs... but somehow I just can't sink in it. It's like I am not compatible with this game. It's just not for me even though I love puzzle games. To me it felt like the game doesn't force You to think, but rather click everything randomly until You find a solution.

But still, it's not a bad game, not at all. I'm totally sure it can find its own fans. I'm just not one of them. I still recommend it though, it's cheap and it's worth a try. Maybe I will come back to it because I know there are much more levels to solve, maybe then I'll change my review. Time will tell. Wirklich schönes Spiel für zwischendurch. Farben und Sounds sind wirklich gut gewählt. Nice game! just try it :) 

really nice gameplay and graphics!"
714780,Google Spotlight Stories: Special Delivery,"норм ‎ ☀️ ⠀ It's fun watching the caretaker and Santa play hide & seek Emmy ödüllü platform Google Spotlight Stories, Akademi Ödüllü stüdyo Aardman Animations'ın sunduğu bir VR deneyimi sunuyor. Çatıdaki gizemli bir yabancıdan rahatsız olan mütevazı bir bekçinin maceralarını takip edin. Oradaki kim?? I really enjoy all of the Google Spotlight Stories. They are short, simple and a great example of how animation can be done in VR. There is nothing to try and teach a new user what to do, just start it and enjoy the show. Special Delivery is a cute one to share during the holidays and feels more like an animated comic strip than a full blown 3D animation. It’s still worth checking out and showing to someone that claims they can’t handle VR. Just a shame there haven’t been any new stories in so many years now. YO A really cool and really well done VR shortfilm. The star of the show imo is how the makers of this project showcase how to make a paper-cut artstyle translate into a 3D environment. Theres a lesson or too to be learn here in character design and replicating this sort of look. That aside, maybe one of the best Google spotlite VR experience I've seen out of seeing a good 3-4 of them.

Note 4~ mins long and ""viewable"" on your PC normally if so desire. Very kid friendly. Короткая комедийная история с небольшим интерактивом, плюс за дизайн и анимацию.

おすすめ This is definitely something which I would want to show my mother. It's just got the nice level of cuteness, cheekiness, and delightfulness to it. It's definitely fun and friendly. This was the second Google Spotlight Story, if I recall correctly. Unlike Pearl, this has a few interactive elements. Depending on which platform you're playing it on, you can raise or lower the camera. Also, the people in the houses will react when you look at them. This is all very grand. The Google Spotlight Stories project was a success, with several films that are excellent, I just wish Google didn't abandon VR.

Cant be recommended enough! great experience my kid loves it, and i love it too, so much detail and cool and funny events.

 A cute story.  Change your elevation to watch things happen, or ignore the Santa capers (they'll pause for you) and check out some of the scenes happening elsewhere in the area.  Cool stuff!  Part of a series by Google. [h1]UN OMAGGIO A BRUNO BOZZETTO?[/h1]

 Good game «Мне пришлось помучиться, чтобы увидеть будущее. Я столько всего насмотрелся! Грязь! Разруха! Кровопролития!» - Fallout 4.

Неа, просто, неа. Игра веселая только первые часа 2. После этого превращается в репетативный ужас. Рандом, страшный и беспросветный рандом. Никакого контроля со стороны игрока, а игра любит вкидывать ивенты, которые убьют тебя за секунды (И как говорится, ""Чем дальше в лес, тем толще партизаны"" ибо на сложности ""Царь-бомба"" игра всеми силами пытается тебя убить.) А достижения тут ещё более отвратные, ибо тоже сплошной рандом. И что бы выбить 3 чертовых ивента, для достижение ""Ордер на обыск"" пришлось играть 150 дней.

Кошмар, ужос и боль Introduzione
""60 Seconds!"" è un gioco di sopravvivenza e avventura sviluppato da Robot Gentleman. Ambientato in un contesto post-apocalittico con un tocco di dark comedy, il gioco ti mette nei panni di Ted e della sua famiglia, un cittadino responsabile che deve affrontare l'imminente caduta di una bomba nucleare. Con solo 60 secondi a disposizione, devi raccogliere provviste e salvare la tua famiglia prima di rifugiarti in un bunker sotterraneo.

Trama e Ambientazione
La storia di ""60 Seconds!"" inizia in una tranquilla periferia degli anni '50, ma la pace viene interrotta dall'allarme di un attacco nucleare. Nei panni di Ted, hai solo 60 secondi per correre per la casa, raccogliere oggetti utili e salvare i membri della tua famiglia. Ogni partita è diversa, con la casa che cambia disposizione e oggetti che appaiono in posti differenti. Una volta nel rifugio, la sopravvivenza diventa una questione di gestione delle risorse, scelte difficili e un pizzico di fortuna.

Gameplay
Il gameplay di ""60 Seconds!"" è diviso in due fasi principali: la fase di scatenamento e la fase di sopravvivenza.

Fase di Scatenamento: Hai 60 secondi per esplorare la casa e raccogliere tutto ciò che potrebbe essere utile, come cibo, acqua, medicine e attrezzi. Devi anche trovare e salvare i membri della tua famiglia. La casa è generata proceduralmente, quindi ogni partita è unica.

Fase di Sopravvivenza: Una volta nel rifugio, il gioco diventa una simulazione di sopravvivenza a turni. Devi razionare il cibo e l'acqua, affrontare eventi casuali e prendere decisioni difficili che possono influenzare la vita o la morte dei tuoi familiari. Gli eventi possono variare da semplici problemi di salute a invasioni di scarafaggi mutanti.

Il gioco offre anche diverse modalità di gioco, tra cui la modalità Apocalisse, che aggiunge nuove sfide e storie, e la modalità Sfide di Sopravvivenza, che ti mette alla prova con scenari unici.

Grafica e Design
""60 Seconds!"" utilizza uno stile grafico 2D con una palette di colori vivaci che ricorda i fumetti degli anni '50. I personaggi e gli ambienti sono disegnati a mano, il che dona al gioco un aspetto unico e accattivante. Anche se la grafica non è spettacolare, si adatta perfettamente al tono dark comedy del gioco. Le animazioni sono fluide e i menu sono intuitivi, rendendo l'esperienza di gioco piacevole e senza intoppi.

Audio e Musica
La colonna sonora di ""60 Seconds!"" è minimalista ma efficace, con musiche che creano un'atmosfera di tensione e urgenza durante la fase di scatenamento e melodie più calme e riflessive durante la fase di sopravvivenza. Gli effetti sonori sono ben fatti, con suoni realistici per le azioni dei personaggi e gli eventi ambientali. Il doppiaggio è limitato, ma i dialoghi testuali sono ben scritti e spesso divertenti, grazie all'umorismo nero che caratterizza il gioco.

Esperienza Complessiva
""60 Seconds!"" offre un'esperienza di gioco unica che combina elementi di avventura, simulazione e sopravvivenza con un tocco di dark comedy. Il gameplay è coinvolgente e ben bilanciato, con una buona dose di rigiocabilità grazie alle case generate proceduralmente e agli eventi casuali. La grafica e l'audio contribuiscono a creare un'atmosfera immersiva e coinvolgente.

Pro e Contro
Pro:

Gameplay coinvolgente e ben bilanciato
Alta rigiocabilità grazie agli elementi procedurali
Grafica e audio che si adattano perfettamente al tono del gioco
Umorismo nero ben scritto e divertente
Contro:

La fase di scatenamento può essere stressante per alcuni giocatori
Alcuni eventi casuali possono sembrare ingiusti o troppo difficili
La modalità di gioco principale può diventare ripetitiva dopo molte partite
Commento Personale
Ho trovato ""60 Seconds!"" sorprendentemente coinvolgente e divertente. La combinazione di urgenza durante la fase di scatenamento e la gestione delle risorse nella fase di sopravvivenza crea un'esperienza di gioco unica. Mi sono trovato a ridere ad alta voce per alcune delle situazioni assurde e delle battute umoristiche. Anche se alcuni eventi casuali possono sembrare ingiusti, fanno parte del fascino del gioco e ti tengono sempre sulle spine.

Conclusione
""60 Seconds!"" è un gioco che consiglio vivamente a chiunque cerchi un'esperienza di sopravvivenza unica con un tocco di umorismo nero. Offre ore di divertimento e sfida, con una buona dose di rigiocabilità. Se sei un fan dei giochi di sopravvivenza o semplicemente cerchi qualcosa di diverso, ""60 Seconds!"" è sicuramente un titolo da provare.

Punteggio complessivo: 8/10 :)
 当初跟风买的，没细玩下去，路线和事件都很多，很有意思的一款作品 good game Um pós Apocalipse Nuclear muito bom ТИММИ, ИДИ НАХУЙ Я схожу с ума bacana 10 смертей из 10 This game throws you into absolute chaos as you scramble to grab whatever food, supplies, and family members you can before the nukes drop. But the real challenge starts after—you’re stuck in a fallout shelter, trying to stretch rations, make tough choices, and not go totally insane. Every playthrough is different, with random events that range from hilarious to downright cruel. The quirky art style and dark humor keep it fun, even when everything goes horribly wrong. Whether you make it out alive or end up eating soup forever, 60 Seconds! is a wild ride worth taking."
2970080,The Littlest Fry,"☀️ ⠀ A short & fun game. Add more levels!
Also the out of water fish flopping physics seems kinda broken. A cute and easy-to-play jumping game with a charming style. It has only 3 levels, and the total playtime is about half an hour.

 Vahşi doğada göletlerin ne kadar acımasız olduğunu keşfederken bir yandan da bir yavruyu korumak zorunda olan küçük bir Japon balığısınız. Amacınız yavru balığı yırtıcı hayvanlardan korumak, onlara manevra yaparken bir yandan da daha güvenli sular ararken yolunuza çıkabilecek diğer engellerden kaçmaktır. So I have put in .4 hours into this game I think the game will have great potential in being a Rainbow Six Siege Competitor. Its a small indie company and not some dog doodoo AAA company that ruins every game they touch. once they add new maps and operators i think this game will cook! give it 4-6 months in the oven and we will see such a great game that will beat siege sales and anything else ubisoft makes. 11/10 would recommend to pick up this game. I broke the game within 30 seconds of playing. 100% recommend pls add more levels developers I'll literally pay you [h1]進行不可が多すぎ[/h1]
子どもと一緒にゴールを目指す魚のゲーム。操作はマウスのみ。左クリックでその地点に向かってダッシュ、右で子供をつれたりはなしたり、スクロールで隠れられるところに隠れる。ESCはメニュー復帰なんかではなく終了してしまうので注意。あと、子供が地面にめり込んだら右クリックではなく押しっぱなし、子供に触れられなくなったら一度水面に出ると直るっぽい。

気になったのが進行不可っぽい状況になることが多い点。陸に子供がうち上げられて水に戻ってこない場合、かなり復帰が難しくなる。スクロールで隠れて子供を離した場合、子供がどこに居るか分からなくなる。親だけがゴールっぽいところに行けた場合は進行不可。死ではないのでゲームオーバーにもならず、諦めてリスタートするしか無い。魚だから仕方ないのかもしれないけど。

魚なので動かしづらいのは仕方ないとして、リセットしなきゃいけない状況がやたら生まれるのがキツい。そういうゲーム性ならリトライボタンなんかが欲しい。 Super cute game! It's the best game on the market, do not let my 12 minutes of playtime fool you. this is a 100+ hour game full of exploration, detailed graphics, RPG elements, and evolving combat better than any game I have ever played. I only have 12 minutes because I am a GOD gamer. If that won't sell u I'm sure this will...THIS GAME HAS NO BATTLE PASS, so suck it call of duty this game is better than the next black ops game, yea I said it. and this game will get game of the year. mark my words..."
2269770,CallOfTree,"It's pretty because Unreal 5 is pretty. There is very little gameplay. Talking to the trees is the main course but it is not clear who is talking at any given time. The sound design is infuriating with very loud localized sounds in one ear instead of a more even sound. This is definitely not worth your $15.

"
1675500,Veronica's Body,"Very underrated game. Reminds of Latex Dungeon. Tedious gameplay and slooow progress. Tranformation mechanic is quite uninteresting. Pros:
 There are not many fetish games like this; it is definitely one of the good sex RPG
 More TF scenes available than Victoria's Body (7 to 4)

Cons:
 Artwork style had changed even though it shares some characters from the previous game (Victoria's Body)
 TF is more like Monsterization, the last one was more like a corruption game  (Could be good for some people)
 Artworks are little weak, only standing CG and mostly text based description This is an RPG game for people with certain fetishes. The protagonist must travel the land and seek out bosses and stones in order to make it to the final boss. In each zone, the heroine will face monsters that are able to transform her body in certain ways. She'll lose or gain abilities as she is transformed. There is a tactical element, because certain abilities will work better against monsters in other zones. Aside from being an ""adult"" game, it's also a rather good RPG, albeit short and basic. You can buy the standard potions, trinkets, and other items to help your heroine along the way.

 I found the art, music and gameplay to be decent and found no bugs or flaws with the game. 

All in all, I thought it was an entertaining game and would like to see more like it. Pros: 
The combat system is much better! I don’t know if the math was just hidden, but the way hits are registered in Veronica’s game are a million times better than that 2d10+Skill thing Victoria had to do. The 2d10 was fun, but it kept the action at a snail’s pace with a few bad rolls and made enemies an inconsistent difficulty.
The different buff/debuffs for attacks are really interesting and transforming was done more out of “Oh I bet this is a good combo!” and not “Oh shit do I need cow tits?? FUck me let’s go collect some crystals!”
The transformation buildup bars are a better solution than immediate transformation, it keeps the combos useful longer and adds more suspense.
The combat feels better because the grinding isn't as tough, but still effective if you do it.
The art is consistent and well done.
Fitting text descriptions for events/transformations/items.
Cons:
The faces for the art are super cookie-cutter. Everyone has the same round face and it takes away from the transformations. The art from the last game was not as polished, but the character felt truly different when their head transformed. The style let the maid mask look porcelain and the bimbo face look plastic. In Veronica's Body, the head transformations don't have that same power. They just change her lip size or her skin tone, it doesn't seem like a transformation change, just a wardrobe change.
Continuing with the art: I have a siccness for the thiccness, and the artist does too, CLEARLY. But, the amazing influence of the thiccness DOES become less profound when every enemy in the game has the dimensions of the Pillsbury Dough Boy's wet dream. The Willing Willow enemy, AMAZING, understandably thicc, she's a tree woman, fertility and all that. The other flower enemy is also well designed, but the fairy type idea could have been leaned on a little bit more.
The Findom girls are in an interesting situation, I would say they fit well, but I think saving that crazy busty model for the Boss Findom would have been a better idea, because then you would reach her and say ""Woah she's orange and has huge melons, she looks so different!"" Not, ""Oh she's just orange? That's kind of weird…"". The BDSM pig girls are great though (AND PROPORTIONED IN A NORMAL WAY, BUT STILL HOT).
This kind of idea carries through the other zones(Disregarding the Doll House. The Dolls weren’t overwhelmingly thicc.) The candle girls, and to a lesser extent the Shrine Maidens are both on the crazy end. (To be clear: My critique on the models isn’t “There isn’t enough body type representation and that makes me angry!” it’s “In a game about transformation the extremes of every kind of change should be explored.” The art is still 10/10 with 6/10 faces)
All in all, don't overuse the sexy ass models and proportions on basic encounters, it takes away from the presence more powerful enemies could have. Keeping the regular people normal, and the elites THICC, let's Veronica's transformations into a THICC whatever-she's-becoming better reflect her power as an individual and it lets her stand out against basic enemies. This can create new dialogue possibilities, reduce the over-saturation of THICC, and accent the MC's special position.

Victoria: Victoria looks like a dwarf with a cleft palate that's short a chromosome. She did not translate well with the art style change.

TL:DR Combat is much better. The transformation system makes more sense. The art is good but too overbearing in places. Victoria looks like a hobgoblin that was dropped as a child. Tickles the transformation fancy 100% and comes along with a solidly polished game.

P.S. It's a niche fetish, and beggars can't be choosers, so I'm signing up for the Patreon and I hope the next game has something like LustFall's art style, if it isn’t, there’s always the 4th.
 Deliciously bonkers and yet good at being so, such are the games I am having fun playing. Now yes, the adults only tag (rightfully earned in my opinion) is a direct hit to how many people can even find this game, in fact I only found it by pure chance. 

But here's the thing, if you were to strip out the hypersexual nature and edit the story/characters accordingly, you would still have a great game on your hands and that is what I find incredible. The puzzle aspects with the various transformations, both for combat and environment are well thought out and give the game an identity as more than another fetish game.  And some of the tf concepts are pretty original too, I won't spoil them but boy is there a grabbag in here. All of it is given life by the descriptive writing and the well made artwork. If it was just text, it would not have had the same impact.

There is one thing I can say disapointed me, in that there are only a handful of instances where you tf changes how your character interacts with other characters. There are attacks that get insanely strong against you and one or two characters that react differently for story reasons but that's about it. When I saw the status 'Corruption Spreader' after a certain tf, I had an interesting idea where this could go, but it didn't. Not much, just a personal gripe that I quickly got over.

All in all, well worth the purchase for more than just the 'naughty bits.'"
709400,Low Desert Punk,"Surpisingly enjoyable for being so simple. Plus the music alone is worth the 50 cents I payed for it. :D A game that is really challenging and that leaves you completely absorbed in your mechanics.

The game makes you stay focused on hitting your score and beating your friends in a ranking system that always encourages you to play again.

If you want some good fun and some fun, play Low Desert Punk !! Low Desert Punk is a high octane single player free roaming driver where your only real mission is to stay alive by not crashing.  Enemies however have a different goal in mind and will swarm you relentlessly trying to crash you up.  Definitely a lot of hand/eye coordination required here.  Combined with the catchy music, this small Unity value game delivers some fun!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmle5FkF2ss

Controls couldn't be simpler.  WASD used on the keyboard, no mouse required.  W to go, S to slow, A & D to swirve your truck left and right.  The Space bar gives you a Nitro boost but is limited by a cool down.  Hit the targets, and use Nitro to allow you to get some revenge on the swarming enemies.  Hitting more targets faster helps get you a bigger multiplier to get bigger score totals.  The game keeps track of the top 9 Steam scores so you'll always have a target score total to aspire to reach, which is nice for a game like this.

Game has two modes, both single player.  One gives you 3 ""hit"" points or 3 lives if you would, and you'll gain a life every level you advance, and the other mode gives you three times the points but only one chance to wreck and your game is over.

You can play with a controller, but WASD and Space worked just fine for me with fluid, responsive controls.

My only gripes were there are ZERO options available.  No sound settings, no resolution options, no key mapping, and not even a full screen/window option.  Bare bones in the options department.  Also there was no cursor on the main screen and selecting a mode and hitting start was tricky for me.. not being able to see a cursor, but that might be because of my dual monitors and might not be an issue for most players. 

My Score for Low Desert Punk is a 74%, mostly hurt by a lower then you might expect ""value"" score.  Even at the price tag under a dollar, I think the game is addictive enough to make most people want to play it a few times, but that will likely only add up to a half an hour for most people.  Good game and fun while it lasts however!"

1255160,Oh So Lucky! Doctor : A Surgery Soap Opera,"Рисовка персонажей — мдя, какие-то они все перекосорыленые. Декорации — просто ужас и жесть, прям застенки гестапо, а не госпиталь. Звуковые эффекты ужасны, озвучка так себе. Мини-игры неиграбельны. Даже за такие небольшие деньги есть более качественные продукты. Quite a strange dating and management RPG sim VN. one one hand, you buy flowers for cute girls - but on the other, you have to do surgery on ruptured spleens. It's definitely worth a laugh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL7rMXGc83I игра отстой. скучная. даже две мини игры в самой игре не спасают. ходишь по этим коридорам, делаешь скучные операции, читаешь тонны текста, еще и русского языка нет
но, послушайте, за такие деньги пойдет. возможно найдутся упоротые, кому такой геймплей зайдет

https://youtu.be/OtDIORr8j6Q This is essentially a dating sim game. You're a medical intern that has to go around and make friends or lovers around the hospital. There are a bunch of people you can interact with. I use the term interact loosely, as your options are to initiate conversations or buy presents. The game opens up as you progress, so there are a few more options available, but this is not a very deep game. 

There are a few mini-games to play to help you earn experience and money. The money is used to buy things to enhance your relationship with the people around the hospital. The writing is decent and the character art is pretty slick looking. I like the 3D effect that's used for the character avatars. Also, the game runs pretty smooth; although there's really not a lot going on visually to tax your CPU. 

On the negative side, the graphics are pretty bland. The hospital looks like...a hospital, but even more depressing. You're basically navigating bland looking hallways to get to each event. The mini-games are fairly simple and this game would have been helped by more variety or complexity. 

Overall, if you're into these kinds of games, it's not a bad purchase. There are, however, better games out there. Cute animation and soapy storyline, just what you might want to pass the time.  The surgical gameplay is unforgiving, but after a while becomes a snap.  Good fun. :)"

Que sofrimento para platinar um jogo...
Foram 7 Horas Intensas de puro sofrimento, o jogo é um pouco bugado, as vezes é necessário passar a mesma fase mais de 1 ou 2 vezes para obter a conquista.
é desafiador até mesmo para obter conquistas ahaha.

Tirando o sofrimento de lado, é um jogo de puzzle de plataforma bem divertido, as fazer são bem distintas umas das outras.
no geral é legal para passar o tempo e raiva junto, porém se for como eu, procurando um joguinho fácil para platinar, saiba que esse não vai ser o caso.
No geral, indico se tiver paciência e muita! hahahah Conquistas bugadas, jogo todo quebrado, é possível sair do mapa e cair no infinito, não é possível dar esc para voltar no menu, as fases não salvam algumas vezes tendo que repetir para desbloqueá-las novamente e em algumas fazes de vez quando, quando da vontade no jogo, spawna um raio da morte invisível que complica bem a jogatina. Enfim, jogo simples, quebrado e de desenvolvedores que não estão nem ai. Jogo divertido e bom para platinar Simple and addictive game. Kolejna gra, kiedy będziesz zastanawiać się, po co to powstało... СЛОЖНАААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААА [h1]Fixed and great[/h1]

1628290,The Last Spell - Original Soundtrack,"听起来就很紧张的手机铃声 咋入手的? Soundtracks like this only come around once every few years. This is my favorite soundtrack since DUSK (2018).

Favorite tracks:
- Invocation
- All Hope Gone
- Hordes Descend
- Awake in the Dark
- The Great War
- Old Woods Love it so much! I listen to this at work to get pumped up! I never expected the soundtrack to be this good. Worth every penny.
Great mixture of metal, synth with a sinister touch. OST sold me the game (luckly). Just a heads up. You can still get the deleted lossless version via steam console.

It will print out destination folder upon completion. ПРОСТО ВОЗЬМИ МОИ ДЕНЬГИ!!! Banger soundtrack for a metal-as-fuck game. Excellent for work, study, or creativity. Absolutely love the build-up between 20 - A Mission and 21 - Old Woods. This game’s OST is on 🔥🔥
 what can I say, it is metal/rock combined with what I believe to be electro. if you are here it's not because you like electro/metal/rock and searched more of that music, it is because you heard it in the game and found it awesome, so just get it and enjoy the background music of slaughtering monster, bosses or being overwhelmed. and, most importantly: have fun Bangers to slaughter the undead to. awesome soundtracks , highly recommend getting these soundtracks Can you add more songs Bury the Light , I think it's quite suitable for this game, I often listen to it when I play this game this is the first time i buy soundtrack. The music distant memories is super good. Every time i listen this song during game play, my head swing like rock star. the only music i would pick over this is Wii music, that's saying something Una delle migliori colonne sonore per game, davvero ben fatta e di ambientazione appropriata per il gioco 音乐不错 First time I bought the soundtrack for anything because the music is just so darn awesome! Well composed, exciting and fits the theme of the game so well! A few of the tracks really gets you going! 可悲 會讓人搞混買到浪費錢"

Grafik ve görsel tasarım konusunda EMERGENCY oldukça başarılıdır. Detaylı ve gerçekçi 3D modeller sayesinde olay yerleri ve afet sahneleri çarpıcı bir şekilde sunulur. Kullanıcı arayüzü, kolay anlaşılır ve kullanıcı dostudur, bu da oyuncuların akıcı bir deneyim yaşamasını sağlar.

Oynanış açısından EMERGENCY, heyecan verici ve zorlu görevleri içeren sürükleyici bir deneyim sunar. Acil durumlarla başa çıkmak için hızlı düşünme, stratejik planlama ve kaynak yönetimi becerilerinizi test edeceksiniz. Farklı senaryo modları ve zorluk seviyeleri, oyunun tekrar oynanabilirliğini artırarak uzun süreli eğlence sağlar.

EMERGENCY, gerçek hayattaki kurtarma ekiplerinin ve itfaiyecilerin zorlu çalışmalarını başarılı bir şekilde yansıtıyor. Bu nedenle, oyunun ciddi bir atmosferi ve gerçekçi bir yaklaşımı vardır. Acil durumları çözerken verdiğiniz kararların sonuçları önemli olabilir, bu da oyunun taktiksel derinliğini artırır.

Ancak, oyunun bazı oyuncular tarafından sevilmeme ihtimali de vardır. Zira EMERGENCY, hızlı aksiyonlu oyunlar arayanlar için biraz yavaş gelebilir ve bazıları için taktiksel zorluklar aşırı gelebilir. Ayrıca, grafiksel olarak en üst düzeyde olmasa da, oyunun oynanış ve konsepti bu eksikliği telafi eder.

Sonuç olarak, EMERGENCY, gerçek zamanlı afet yönetimi simülasyonlarına ilgi duyan oyuncular için keyifli bir deneyim sunar. Zorlu görevler, taktiksel düşünce gerektiren oynanışı ve gerçekçi yaklaşımıyla, sizi kendine çekecek ve uzun süre oynamanızı sağlayacaktır.

Oyun tam sürüme çıktığında Türkçe dil desteği alacağını umuyorum. Naja der teil catsh mich nicht und der play test hätte aus meiner sicht ne woche gehen müssen das man sich ein eindruck machen kann. Free to play geil aber ingame zahlung ist scheiße da hätte man das spiel für 5-10€
machen können ich hoffe das es noch ein free play multipayer modus kommt wie bei den Vorgängern und mehr möglich keiten denn hatt stand jetz ist das spiel schmutz da spiel ich lieber Emergency 4 & 5 als denn teil.
alleine dur denn Modding support durch die Community.
 Poprawiona grafika, gra w trybie multiplayer oraz zmienione sterowanie. Ogólne wrażenia Pozytywne i czekam na pełną wersję!!! Bonjour est très interressant et addictif, je le recommande !! Really interesting gameplay, even its just in beta right now. 

Interesting to see what they  can bring into the game. funny and amazing - Playtest verlief sehr zuverlässig, es gab nahezu keine Performanceprobleme noch sind irgendwelche Bugs aufgefallen.

Freue mich sehr auf die Veröffentlichung!

 graphisme de l'écran très bien avec des très bon scénario d'intervention que j'ai pu faire en test Рекомендую данную игру! Очень интересная и необычная работа спасательных служб, по ней можно увидеть со стороны как они работают, всё детально и подробно. Не проходите мимо, приобретите игру и попробуйте её. Cela fait plaisir de revoir le retour de cette licence plaisant a jouer avec nos amis. L'ajout de compétence et de customisation est original. J'ai certain point négatif a date que je trouve plus aumoin ordinaire ou dommage. (Avis personnel)
-Le jeux est beaucoup trop guider il est presque trop facile de jouer.
-Le fait de pas pouvoir mettre nos véhicules ou on veux.
-Le fait de pas pouvoir se déplacer sur une grande map (comme un peux un mode libre)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Point Positive :
-Ambiance d'Animation des interventions agréable et améliorer.
-Le choix de choisir parmi un large choix de compétence.
-Le choix de modifier les tenues des intervenants.
-possibilité de personnalisé les véhicule d'intervention.
-Le groupe tactique de la police avec le camion blindé que je trouve originale et différent.
-Qualité de l'environnement Parfait.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
En général c'est se que je trouve au jeux j'ai toujours aimer cette licence je remercie les développeurs de avoir eu accès au pré test du jeux pour le tester. If you have played the previous versions of Emergency, knowing how frustrating it can be to get your units in the correct positions, they have fixed this issue. I'm anticipating the release of the full game. The visuals are awesome compared to previous versions. 
Overall, great game that provides great entertainment.

☑ 10 Ich bin begeistert. Als Neuling in Emergency kann ich mich im Spiel sehr schnell zurechtfinden, die Grafik ist sehr ansprechend und auch die Steuerung gefällt mir. Den Kritikpunkt, dass man nicht mehr so viel Micromanagement machen kann, kann ich nicht nachvollziehen, denn durch die vielen Schwierigkeitsgrade ist man immer voll ausgelastet.
Ich kann das Spiel jedem empfehlen, der schon einmal in die Rolle des Disponenten schlüpfen wollte.

Ich kann seit dem letzten Update das Spiel zwar nicht mehr spielen, aber der Support ist dort sehr freundlich und die Devs arbeiten schon daran, also freue ich mich auf das nächste Update. Leider macht es Emergency nicht mehr aus. Die komplette Barrierefreiheit fehlt. Fahrzeuge haben Ihren festen Platz, man kann nur eine gewisse Anzahl an Einheiten steuern. Es ähnelt Emergency Hq sehr. Ich war nie ein Freund von diesem Format. Schade! I was very happy when I read that there will be a new part of the series. I was even happier to get an impression of the game with the tech test. I was all the more disappointed when I experienced what became of this game.

I've been playing this series since the first installment and each new installment added something different that added to the fun. Things got a little different with Emergency 5 and its subtitles, but ok, not every wheel can be reinvented. I've also played the mobile game Emergency HQ, but that's absolutely not my platform for such a game.
The playtest of the upcoming part was more of a shock. Graphically it's certainly very good, but I'm talking about the general design and the game mechanics. Not even in the first part you were so limited in terms of units and placement options for the units. Everything is reminiscent of a mobile game, the only thing missing (in the tech test) is the in-game shop, where I can buy new slots for units in order to be more efficient. The vehicles (design) and units and their uses are far from any reality (I'm in the voluntary fire brigade). And from the Mechanic tested so far, it's just disappointing. In order to be able to call a unit, another unit must be sent back and once this has completed the task, the previously sent unit can be alerted again. That eludes any logic at the deployment site.

Have the developers ever bothered to take a closer look at the Part 4 and Part 5 mods? Some very good examples of mechanics and design were developed here by the community (LA, Bieberfelde, Lüdenscheit, Wegberg, to name just a few examples). Why is one's own fan community so despised?

For me it is clear that I will not buy this game. Endlich wieder freier parken, durch viel mehr Parkslots an quasi jeder Ecke der jeweiligen Einsatzmap (anders als bei EMHQ). Das Multiplayer-Feature ist großartig! Leider ist das Game des Namen Emergency nicht würdig. Selbst wenn man alleine spielt statt mit anderen ist der schwierigkeitsgrad leider sehr sehr leicht.Kann sich später vieleicht noch ändern. Auch das man die Fahrzeuge nur noch in fertigen Buchten parken kann ist leider absolut nicht meins. Und es ist vieles extrem vereinfacht worden.Man muss z.b. nicht mal mehr einen Feuerlöscher oder einen Rettungsschere ausrüsten. Das macht das spiel von alleine.  Desweiteren kommt es mir Persönlich so vor das  man nur Versucht das Mobil game gefühlt auf den Pc umzusetzen. Ich Finde sie hätten lieber wieder ein Emergency wie früher endwickelt. Weil meiner Meinung nach stirbt die reihe mit diesem Game. Wie gesagt das ist nur meine ganz Persönliche Meinung. Habe das große Vergnügen die Beta spielen zu dürfen. Wer schon früher Emergency gespielt wird dieses Spiel mögen. Die Steuerung ist anfangs etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig aber relativ gut zu erlernen. Die Grafik sieht sehr gut aus. Zoomen raus und rein sehr empfehlenswert um sich einen Gesamt- Überblick über die Einsatzstellen zu verschaffen. Ich denke das Spiel hat Suchtfaktor. Bin mal gespannt wie das komplett fertige Spiel ist. Dla mnie osobiście rewolucja w serii Emergency i to stanowczo na plus. Bardzo dobrze się gra, dobre dodatki do zabawy. Jeden mankament jaki znalazłem to strefa rażenia płomieni, mogłaby się zmniejszać wraz z ich gaszeniem oraz bardzo proszę o wprowadzenie polskiej wersji językowej. Macht sehr viel Spaß. Es ist recht stabil, keine Abbrüche und auch bei 4 Spielern ohne großes ruckeln"
3297520,VR Store Simulator,"Game has been a lot of fun! But, there's a few things that need some work to make the game smooth and more enjoyable, in my opinion.
First thing, please remove the weighted physics of boxes when holding a box of items. The way they flop around is laggy and frustrating. The physics on these boxes also seems to create massive lag sometimes, I believe. If the box has tipped over on the ground and is leaning on something else, the game really doesn't seem to like it.
Customers should not have to pick up their bought items one at a time after purchase - surely we can just be 'bagging' them as we're scanning them, to help speed things up? I'm only at level 10 and with the waving monkey out the front, the line ends up pretty long pretty quick sometimes. Can't wait for the update to hire some kid to work the checkout or stock shelves lol.
Custom adjusted prices for items not saving after returning to the game next boot up? Also would love to see a 'pause menu' of a sorts, with a way to exit back to main menu.
Brightness in the store is pretty overexposed during the daytime, its as if the roof isn't stopping the sun or something? I thought it was maybe because of the snow, but I noticed it today as well (snow was removed in the update earlier in the day).
Inputting the total sale price via the pinpad is very finicky to do, I find myself struggling to cleanly input the right numbers most of the time, and I've got a reasonably steady hand.
Please please please put something in for snapping locations of the shelves. Very frustrating and inconsistent to place them down currently.
The way the clock and time works in game seems a bit odd? Can only order stuff from 7am-9pm, but as long as the 'OPEN' light is on, anyone can come into the store? I think it might benefit from a system where the 'day' starts when you plug in the open sign after hitting the button on the clock, so you can do a morning stocktake and order before opening, then customers stop coming in at 9pm when the 'shift' ends. Not the end of the world by any means, but just found it strange tbh.
I think that's all. I've been enjoying the game a lot, but there's definitely room for improvement on a few things.
Also worth mentioning i've played on both a Rift S, and a Vive Focus Vision, with all issues present on both. This game is amazing for it not being out for that long. This is the best vr simulator I've played. This game has a ton of potential too. Good job :thumbs up i like to robing  guys wallets  ( in vr :P
 ) this game has massive potential to be a relaxing cashier game that for some reason makes you wanna keep playing although real cashiers are probably miserable lmao it is a tad bit buggy but with some polishing and consistant updates and care i see myself playing this a good bit. some of the bugs and/or issues are 1) the shelf are kinda buggy to place against the walls at time and can sometime go inside, 2) at day 3 i noticed the customers say they couldnt find flour so i figured i was out but when i went to buy some i noticed i had half a shelf of flour still on my shelf and they still couldnt find flour. 3) some of the products either lose the ability to be gripped or are arent registered in the world bc i noticed customers tended to choose said products.  some quality of life notes (not bugs, more OCD things)  cereal doesnt go on the shelf in an order thaat allows one box to fit so you tend to half to waste another level for 1 or 2  or have surplus, when i buy sugar and flour i get 9 and the shelf fits 10 so when im done shelfing im sad bc my OCD is like EERRRRGGGG lol.  at the end of the day the game is fun and addicting and kinda funny at times but has some issues that need to be fixed in order to be able to scale into something with replayable longivity.   P.S what is up with all of the prisoners!!!!! what prison had a security breach!! lmao"
487280,Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion - Outlaw Sectors DLC,"An essential DLC. The roaming NPC-controlled militia ships not only make the game mor interesting to play, but - crucially - also make the whole ""Empire-management"" aspect of the game more ""believable."" It really adds a lot the imersion

Edit: I hope they add a similar DLC or mechanic to Sins 2. Rampant Militias is probably one of the best things implemented in this genre of game.

Buy for this alone The Militias are often annoying and or useless but do occasionally have their moments. The pirates are even more annoying and exhausting than usual. This whole DLC is just annoying and exhausting, and the only way I would ever enable it is with pirates turned off. In the original game, the pirates only attacked the player with the highest bounty.

With this DLC, the pirates always attack you AND the player with the highest bounty.  This breaks the game in the beginning.  Even at the beginning, a pirate fleet can't be taken out by one capital ship and continually building fighters to defend your HOMEWORLD.  This DLC should never have been implemented, and having bought the game with this DLC, I am uninstalling it now.  I bought the original game from Stardock years ago, and stopped playing it when they unbalanced the game so bad it was unplayable.  Looks like they did it again with this DLC.

If you want to win, uninstall this DLC.  It will allow you to focus on your enemies.  Pirates don't colonize planets, they simply destroy them.  This DLC can see you trying to fight (and lose) on 4 fronts at once (two enemies plus two pirate raids at once). Lots of new features. Overall worth the price. The idea is great and the content is good, but the only reason I'm saying do NOT get this DLC is because of the changes to Pirates made with this DLC. You can't revert the changes at all during game setups, so you're pretty much forced to disable pirates every time from now on, like I have to.

Avoid this one, buy all the others. It should be implemented in vanilla game for free. Planetary militias are a great addition if you like getting surprised by the occasional massive fleet around an unexplored world. Quite seriously - this mechanic can end up greatly slowing down expansion if you are extremely slow. win10游戏为什么进不去？ Not much in it.  But also good price. So just grab it and support great DEVS. :) 主要就是多了ai控制的舰队帮你守家，占领得越久船也会越来越多，像t族就会给标枪梭镖棕熊灰马什么的，前期防守压力会小很多，除此之外还多了新地图，总体而言比起前两个dlc来说性价比高了很多的，可以入 This adds a nice little extra challenge to the game its worth it. Really makes the early and late game a bit more interesting, would recommend. Really happy I got this DLC and can't wait to get more this DLC is good with more maps I can play on more maps now thanks Bunch of maps that you probably won’t use and a ‘feature’ that involves endlessly spawning mobs of ships. It’s more annoying than interesting tbh. Spice thing up with added scenarios, maps and encounters. Makes the game more interesting when you complete a scenario map from time to time. 我都不知道我为什么买这个dlc：
原以为只是加几个地图，后来发现所有地图都加入了新元素：[b]民兵。
如果只是民兵就算了，但关键是民兵你还能跑到我地盘打我？！
打我就算了，你tm还能自动增加数量？还没有一点征兆？！
这我也能忍，但整个地图只有玩家我这边是这样我就不能忍了！[u]开局[/u]一个星球民兵比我整个舰队还多！是的你没听错，开局进去侦查到7、8艘，等舰队造出来就增加到十几艘，打到一半又多出来几艘，个个都比我强还能忍？跟海盗一起跳到我的地盘打我还能忍？一看旁边就我这样我还能忍？[/b]
呵呵 can some one anwser if i know if im placing the dlc i paid for? Пираты могут играть ключевую роль в игре, усложняют и разнообразят её. Жаль, что нельзя играть за них (только в модах-можно), в остальном - интересно, особенно штурмовать их столицы титанами и крупными кораблями. Definatly helps bring out the best the game has to offer"
795050,Techno Boy,"This is not a terrible game but something I will probably never return to. Необычное управление, необычная музыка. Лёгкая игра чтобы отдохнуть после работы. Спасибо огромное разработчикам и всем кто принимал участие в создании игры. В основном если играть на клавиатуре могут возникнуть проблемы с прыжком у Технопарня, но это мелочи) Very good hardcore platformer with nice varied visuals and great techno music.  

There are 4 worlds to explore, each world is made up of 15 levels for a total of 60 levels.  Each world has a different aesthetic and completely different sets of obstacles giving every world a very different feel.  The first few levels of each world are very easy, they are basically there to show you how the traps/level hazards work in that stage and then after a few training levels in that world the real challenges begin.  

The difficulty curve in this game is great, it is a hard game and you will die a decent amount, but it is not frustrating.  Every time you die it is your fault and because of instant respawns you will jump right back into action and learn from your mistakes.  This game did a great job of always making me feel like I would beat the level on my next try which really keeps you in the action.   Many levels also offer a degree of flexibility in how you handle them and often just changing your approach to a level can make it much easier.

Controls are fast, when you first play them you will probably think they are too fast, but you will get the hang of them.  Controls are simple, you can walk (very quickly) left to right and you have a jump button, tapping jump produces short jumps and holding it produces long jumps.  You also have a mid-air dash move that lets you cover a lot of ground quickly and you can cling to walls and bounce up them/back and forth between them.  It is all pretty standard fare but it works well here.

A few complaints:

1) The jump button is mapped to Y on the xbox pad by default, very weird, make sure you change it before the game starts.

2) The game does not work with the control pad, this is a pretty huge deal.  I use a logitech controller with a button that turns the stick into the dpad and vice versa but if you are playing with an xbox controller you will be forced to use the stick.   Personally, this would have made the game unplayable for me, and it is definitely something the devs need to fix, precision games like this are made to be played with a dpad.

3) No mid level checkpoints, granted most levels are short and don't really need them, but some levels drag on a bit and a mid level checkpoint would have been nice, especially on the final level.

4) The final level is disproportionately difficult compared to the rest of the game.  Yes, I know its the final level, but for a game with such a nice difficulty curve there is simply no reason for the last level to be that much harder than the rest of the game.  I think up to the final level I died a total of around 150 times, on the final level I died around 80 times, that tells you something is off.  I almost quit the game but decided to stick it out and was rewarded with a completely crap ending, not that a game like this really has a story but it still felt like an f you.

Overall, techno boy is a really fun platformer and if you are into this genre I can't imagine you not enjoying it. Por que Esta Bien Shoriso
 Ребятки, кто нибудь мне подскажет как звук у игры прикрутить? Ничего против музыки не имею, но слишком громкая
 Хороший платформер, очень драйвовый и динамичный, порадовала подобранная музыка и плотность графики, из минусов можно выделить разве что неочевидность управления и скольжение, а так в целом поиграть стоит. Прикольная игра, в духе Super Meat Boy, советую поиграть если вам понравился он.
Плюсы:
-Хорошая механика
-Множество видов ловушек
-60 уровней в разных стилях
Минусы:
-Отсутствие настроек в игре
-Долгое возрождение Goodbye my nerves!!!
Cool!  Хардкорный платформер с забавным персонажем. Этот парень немного напоминает Колобка в бейсболке.
В игре 4 мира: лаборатория, космос, хоррор и цирк. В каждом по 15 уровней. Наша задача пробежать через разнообразные ловушки до выхода. Жизнь одна, но попытки не ограничивают. Это радует, учитывая, что умирать придется множество раз.
Графика красочная, русский язык и достижения поддерживаются. Любителям платформеров и динамичного геймплея рекомендую. Это настоящий вызов, который не каждый сможет преодолеть.
 [h1]«Techno Boy»[/h1]
Платформер, в котором вам придется много прыгать и умирать.

Очень милая графика, немного напоминающая красочные детские аркады. Но сложность в игре явно не для детей. Прыгать придется много, еще и разгоняться при прыжках. Не самая привычная механика. Зато уровни не забыли нашпиговать пилами и лазерами. Их достаточно, чтобы вызвать пожар в пятой точке даже у довольно ловких и продвинутых геймеров.

Понравилось оформление, графика и музыка. Диалоги на русском. По мере прохождения демонстрируют несколько забавных мультфильмов.

[code]Симпатичная игра по адекватной цене. Любителям испытаний рекомендую. Еще один сложный, красочный платформер в коллекцию. Этот «Techno Boy» заставит вас попотеть, пока вы будете проходить все 60 уровней! В награду получите достижения.[/code]

[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/25737869/] 5 minutes of game [/url] Fantastic music and visuals! The gameplay is difficult, but not too punishing. Wish you could have chaeckpoints in longer levels, unless there are and I haven't reached them yet. Still, amazing overall! 9.9/10 Cool and hardcore, I Love such games)) Very nice)) Очень крутая игра, интересная графика, любителям настоящего хардкора придется по вкусу! Игра, в которой можно проиграть через секунду после начала уровня.

Где даже когда ты 50 раз умер, перестал играть, попил чаю, успокоился, начал играть еще раз и прошел уровень - тебе вместо салюта и фанфар дают ачивку ""slow boy"".

Где я пока играл вспомнил все плохие слова еще с детского сада."
